“Struggling a little bit” is the understatement of the year
terrorisim. this is terrorist attack covered  and legislated by usa  .biased as usa allow ukrain to defend and have the right to defend against russia but not the palestinians against israel . contradiction and injustice .this is usa policy
If Japan gets nuclear strike. This reporter be like: Two Japanese cities are struggling little bit with high temperature.
"What are ppl smoking , stop the war otherwise there will be last Ukrainian left"
&quot;Russias war on ukraine&quot; you say? Get it right this is about america and nato using ukranians as a canon fodder.. Not one move for a peaceful settlement proves the point..
Ukraine is a joke
"The colonel doesn&#39;t understand a cockpit is a cockpit, a driver doesn&#39;t have to pass their driving test in all cars, all car&#39;s dashboards are different, why should this be different in plane&#39;s and tank&#39;s and helicopters. 😂😂"
Useless general&#39;s are also in pentagon experience in only killing women&#39;s and children&#39;s
Little bit ?
Russia should just drop some nukes already and end this.
LAP OF MUDASSAR SHAH....
BROTHER OF KAUSAR SHAH TALKS ABOUT BS &quot; ANALYST DEVELOPMENT &quot; .... SLEEPING IN PARK HUJRA WITH SHAWL.... AT NIGHT...... FOOTPATHS OF LAHORE..... EATING OF BREADS+DAL...... <br>SAFDAR.... <br>FLOWERS ARREST.......
YES what progress you are making Ukraine!!! 🎉<br>YOU ARE PROPAGANDA CNN.
The offensive failed. Border movement turned out to be a trap
It’s a rope a dope strategy
"How will Ukraine ever thank Joe Biden and Jake skullivan for fixing their country even better than Hillary fixed Libya?  They&#39;ll forever be in debt to America&#39;s genius democrats, but with hunter Biden going to jail they&#39;ll need some new routing/ account numbers, maybe Joe bidens brother can receive the funds in one of his shell companies.  Anyway when Joe Biden and the state department grifters fix your country forever it doesn&#39;t come for free, obviously, u gotta show your appreciation to the big guy and pay your Biden bribe tax while your country implodes.  You&#39;re welcome, Ukraine!"
Ukraine is made to look like winners despite their admission to struggling to make any progress. I did not understand the word propaganda. Now I do.
"The USA is a third-world country with living genetic garbage running around the world with a nuclear baton, like a monkey with a grenade."
What a tragedy that so many brave boys are asked to die for such a bad cause - the theft and enrichment of a murderous few.
Im dumber for listening to this gibberish
&quot;Struggling a little bit&quot; 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂<br>43 THOUSAND DEAD<br>  Lol
"Why don&#39;t you simply negotiate peace instead of wasting so much money,??? Everyone knows that Ulkraine was never was going to be a match for Russia."
Struggling. <br>They are getting slaughtered. <br>Paybacks a bitch.<br>It was okay for the Ukrainian military slaughtered civilian ethnic Russian people of old Russian territory. <br>Russia again has to save the world. <br>Second world war.<br>It was not the US.<br>Stop listening to western propagandists. <br>450 dead Ukrainian soldiers should make you war pigs think about talking war with Russia.
Ukraine is so desperate that they are willing to commit acts of terrorism by purposly targeting civilians... and not care but they know it will all be whitewashed by western media... like the Clinton News Network..
"HAHAHAHA &quot;We know that ukraine was struggeling a lil bit&quot;... LOL they are getting annihilated... 45,000 UA soldiers DEAD in under 3 months.."
Ukraine has not been &quot;struggling a little bit&quot;. It has been struggling quite Badly. Don&#39;t try to sugar-coat it.
"Come on, did anyone with even half a brain cell, think that the Ukraine was going to beat Russia...."
Hahaha...  awesome Russia 🇷🇺 ❤
She makes the blonde stereo type so accurate.
A little 🤔 hmm
"Carritos de motor pequeño para usarlos como carne de cañón,millones de esos, así estos rusos gastarán millones de balas y morteros."

delusional idea....
This looks to me like battlefield news adapted for children under 6 and adults with special needs.
"Please STOP lying CNN. Don&#39;t look at the skin color. Please, people are dying."
"Ive read stories of pilots allready trained thought it was easy to fly f 16,s as its flys itself compared to a russian jet"
These clowns in the media and their bosses are something to look fwd to...😂
Ukraine is not struggling but they are losing it badly
The propaganda here is of the scale bonkers <br>No wonder viewers are leaving in droves and at the same time waking up to hyperbolic hogwash
Can We get Biden to give Us Our $ back  ? This whole &quot;war&quot; has been full of lies
Well this aged well. A Ukrainian Pilot died a few days after in an F16 and it wasnt even engaging Russians at the time. It was a training exercise 🤦🏾‍♂️. Somebody stop this stupidity and end the war at the negotiating table.
They discuss war like a sports show discusses tactics.
"Nice picture of a ataack in the cockpit, from the ground ore drone"
Ukraine....meh.
Little bit is vast understatemant
"CNN is funny. The loss of 350,000 Ukrainian soldiers, and 2 million Ukrainian injured is not."
Ukrainian fascists must be defeated. Their masters shouldn&#39;t be spared either.
Viva Russia.....
"What fools allowed the Russians to have months of undisturbed time to build their extensive fortications.<br>       The Ukrainians are being killed at an estimated         ratio of seven to one in favor of Russia.<br>        What is required to attack and penatrate prepared defensive lines and fortifications is well understood  by the military. <br>    The Russians learned in WW2  the benefit of allowing the enemy to expend their troops, equipment, ammunition on well established defensive lines with air cover.<br> Ukrainian Commanders have and are still sending their troops etc into the Russian meat grinder and ignoring the lessons the history of this type of war fare.<br>CNN Obervation that Ukrain is having &quot;a little difficulty&quot; breaking through the Russian defences may qualify as their biggest understatement to date.<br>Yankee Joe couldn&#39;t orgqnize a retreat out of Afghanistan so it follows he would be no more competent in planning attacks.<br>I imagine there are US/NATO educated generals deeply frustrated by the nonsensical troop destroying  strategies by those in charge. They are likely politcal veterans and military amateurs.<br>Stop the killing."
"Problem for Ukraine is that russia also as drones of various sorts along with iskander ballastic missiles, plenty of artillery, and with a large pool of man power they can call on"
😂😂😂 aký problém😅 Rusko dostane späť územia ktoré jej PATRILI.<br>UKRAJI NA SVOJE KYJEVSKÁ RUS.<br>Ak už o niekom hovoríte doučte sa HISTÓRIU😂😂😂
Who knew that attacking fortifided positions was a hard battle like there are littleraly seven layes of defenses in some areas
"why the U.S. have not provided APACHE HELICOPTERS? forget the f-16s, these attack helicopters are much more effective supporting the ground troops, I just don&#39;t understand who the heck is calling the shots at the Pentagon, but having all the necessary equipments parked gathering dust is a sin, UKRAINE BADLY NEED AIR SUPPORT AT LEAST 50 APACHES WILL DO A LOT OF GOOD FOR THE UKRAINIAN ARMY, REMEMBER THAT YOU MADE UKRAINE TO GIVE UP THEIR NUCLEAR ARSENAL IN EXCHANGE FOR WHAT? WORDS OR SOME FEW THINGS, NONE OF THIS MURDEROUS INVASION WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF UKRAINE STILL HAD THEIR NUKES OR AT LEAST SOME, SINCE 1994 YOU HAVE DONE ALMOST ZERO FOR UKRAINE, WHAT BASIC TRAINING? ABOUT TRAINING PILOTS, TANKERS, AIR DEFENSE, ARTILLERY ROTARY WING, NOPE YOU WENT ON THE CHEAOP WHILE YOU WASTED BILLIONS AND BILLIONS ON A SORRY ASS AFGHAN &quot;SO-CALLED ARMY?, WHICH IN THE END TURNED INTO A TALIBAN REARMAMENT."
"CNN has done a good job spreading misinformation about the war in Ukraine, first were the HIMARs how they have been a game changer in the war,  now they will hype the old F16😅 , how Russian soliders are ill equipped, poor constcripts, with no militatry experience, how sanctions r hurting the Russian economy, but in reality when look at the Ukrainian villages and buidling it shows a very lethal Russian army with loads of ammo,"
Ukraine getting its ass kicked. Russian heroes will conquer.
"quit drinking the MSM koolaid people...the reality of the conflict is Ukraine is losing, BADLY...its a real shame that the US media perpetuates this lie about how Russia is inept and losing on the battlefield when the truth is that Ukraine&#39;s military had been basically bled dry and are on the verge of collapse"
14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS - let&#39;s not forget who Ukraine honours as heroes even in modern times. Nazis. Russia is bad but Ukraine is no better. We should not be helping Nazi sympathisers in the modern age.
Conspircy News Network<br>F you
The devision could have been avoided by Ukraine becoming neutral.  The &#39;West&#39; didn&#39;t allow that to happen..  for the sake of their own interests in that region. - Peace will only be achieved by respecting Russian interests and issues as well.<br>It is as simple as that!!
One thing is for sure Ukraine is devided..
Yet we keep giving them money why?
"Colonel you always lie, before the Ukrainian offensive say have been say a lots of lies, now you are talking about the F 16 , even if Ukrainian have F 16 it changes nothing on the battle ground,   and from which airfield will the F 16 fly from , as soon the F 16 arrive Russia will strike the airfield with the F 16, Ukrainian have lost the war with mass casualties. Ukrainian suffered more than  400,000 dead , not mentioning the ones in the hospital over 30 000 Ukrainian soldiers are in hospital and have been Amputated,  Ukrainian have lost the war ,"
"Monuments to the stupidity of mankind, you know this is the same thing that the Germans did the ditches of verdant, the guns of Navarro, all things man made will always be overcome, nobody gave them a chance against the Russians. Russians but they are still kicking the Russians butt."
And because it&#39;s very different means that they won&#39;t be able to fly them. Now doesn&#39;t that make sense!?! Ukraine has already lost this war and Jets aren&#39;t going to make them win it
JOKE
Same guy had got on the Russia koolaid at the beginning of the war and said Russia would have no problems. Well now Russias army is the second strongest army in Russia (Waggers 🐕 group being first that is)
"Giving Ukraine weapons is only going to prolong the conflict, you forget that Ukraine is fighting a global superpower which has resources to sustain its economy, we need peace"
Weldone Russia 🇷🇺👍
Struggling abit??
CNN is feeding its audience disinformation and cheap propaganda. <br>The idea is to keep their audience ignorant about forever wars of its government.
they are done
Anthony Blinken said that Ukraine has recently  regained 50% of the territory that it lost since the beginning of the war which started over a year ago. Yet the state department has been telling us that Ukraine has been winning the war from the beginning.
"It really makes me sick how these people talk about war like it&#39;s something easy and simple, this is a topic not to be talked about like these talking heads do"
Romania should mobilize secretly police forces into International legion and recruit market guards who think are almighty here....
"Yeah, &quot;Ukraine is struggling a little bit&quot;. Half of their 40 million population left the country. over half a million of who&#39;s left have been killed. The country is heavily in debt with no means to repay it. Industry, mining and energy sectors are destroyed, agriculture is dying. And the country is led by a nazi regime that is trying to survive by lying and forcing more and more people to the front to die from shells and mines. All to help a senile american liar win the re-election he won&#39;t even remember.<br><br>PS Anyone still wonders why CNN&#39;s popularity and trust levels are in a tailspin?"
He said the counter offensive has slowed because of up to three layers of defence. However he seems to skip the fact they haven&#39;t even reached the first layer and they still can&#39;t move forward.<br><br>Who is he trying to fool?
&quot;Even I can understand...&quot; that&#39;s how CNN  simplifies a very complicated situation; even a clueless pretty lady could understand things.
Bro they were Introduced in 1978 not the 80’s some of those airframes are 45 years old.
Stop the war
so Ukraine children will be given drowns to fly!
"Waste of tax payers monies funding this war,the whole thing is a disaster. Democrats won&#39;t win the next presidential elections."
USA 🇺🇸 NATO go home 🏡 stop ✋ the Warmongering 🎉❤
"I used to buy into this CNN Garbage ..<br>I quickly came to the realization that Ukraine is suffering massive casualties, while they haven’t even been able to reach the first line of defense <br>And that’s a FACT.<br>I try to analyse this situation from 2 angles, and the reality is that Ukraine is not doing well.<br>I used to support Ukraine and watched guys like Jake Broe, <br>And I often asked myself:<br>“If Ukraine is doing so well, then why haven’t they been able to penetrate Russian lines?”.<br>Cause Ukraine is NOT doing well !!!!!!"
who is  this ?? PATTON ?  ROMMEL??MacArthur????? pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee   !!!
"Colonel, shame on how much bullshit you talk. EXACTLY NATO AND THE USA DENIES YOU WITH THE STATEMENTS THAT YOU HAVE NO MORE AMMUNITION. Ukrainians have run out of body bags, so many dead Ukrainians (tens of thousands) in the last 2 months.⚪🔵🔴⚪🔵🔴- 🟢⚪🔴🟢⚪🔴 Russians and Italians friends forever."
Russia will win this war and the stupidity of Biden the crook and Zelensky will show to the hole world!!!
Training? Why not just hop in that computer with a jet engine and take off? Who needs to know the hardware and software? Tom Cruise could do it!<br><br>Save us from these fools pushing the BS  that Ukraine has any hope of winning this war.
"Cnn&#39;s man zelensky needs 10000 mobilized soldiers a month plus the heavy equipment supplied uninterruptedly to sustain the Frontlines.. Anything less, cnn&#39;s man Frontlines will break.. Whichever comes first the Russians are  eyeing... To move forward with ease.. Even though now they  choose grinding than advancing."
"Mmmmmm i 🤔 why bbc not telling the views this  <a href=""https://youtu.be/ZwO5tEN_kIA"">https://youtu.be/ZwO5tEN_kIA</a>"
“Struggling a LITTLE BIT” - CNN made my day 😅
Amarica aur nato per jis din atom bomb gere ga us din us din har desh mai santi hogi
I’m no expert but all the critics are from countries that have all the elements of mobile warfare to theoretically conduct that type of war. The Ukrainians don’t have all elements and are forced to make do. From what I see the gains they have made it is much better then what the Russians have done. The west want instant gratification and war does not necessarily provide that.
"The biggest problem Ukraine has is taking military advice from US military officers. US military officers are all losers based on their recent measurable results, especially the losers spewing on CNN."
"Hey colonel, get it right - the AFU haven&#39;t even made it to the first &#39;defensive belt&#39; anywhere so at this point those belts are not even a factor. The &#39;offensive&#39;, not counter-offensive, is failing miserably as anyone with a brain could have predicted.<br><br>Much to the chagrin of Western (US) Intel and command, you&#39;re not dealing with an Iraq or Afghanistan. We (US) have not done actual direct sustained battle with a major power since 1945 (the Ukes are just our proxy boots on the ground). Enough of the anecdotal &#39;feel good&#39; BS. It&#39;s (been) high time for peace negotiations, but that&#39;s not what the US really wants - after all the whole idea of this conflict is to keep it active as long as possible with the hope of weakening Russia, not Ukraine independence (however that&#39;s defined). Time to bring this to a close, not keep banking on false hopes, before it does turn into a direct conflict that could in fact turn  nuclear - by either side."
The next chapter of this war is the US regretting having given away all their weapons to Ukraine only to loose.
What russia do is same what Soviet do when nazi attack soviet in ww2....they step back and make new defend line to fight back
ukraine should attack the kremlin...turn those buildings into a pile of rubble. then maybe they can do their business in FEMA trailers.
<b>IF  UKRAINE WANTS F-15 JETS.  ZELENSKY SHOULD BUY THEM.  ACTUALLY SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THEM AFTER RUSSIA TOOK CRIMEA.  BUT  ZELENSKY DID NOTHING TO BUILD  MILITARY TO SAVE THE COUNTRY.  STILL NOT SPENDING ANY MONEY.  HIDING/BURYING BILLIONS FROM USA</b>
"On the hindsight, everyone is a genius. <br><br>This is the same General who said Ukraine would win."
this might just be my observation but it seems that UKRAINE TODAY IS THE SINGLE MOST DANGEROUS PLACE TO FLY AIRCRAFTS AROUND.........EVEN RUSSIANS ARE USING AIRPOWER WITH EXTREME CAUTION BECAUSE....THE QUALLITY AND QUANTITY OD ANTI-AIR ASSETS IN THIS BATTLEFIELD IS AT SUCH LEVEL THAT NO ONE IN SANE MIND WOULD PROPOSE AIR ASSULT OPERATIONS.<br><br>WHOEVER IS HOPING THAT AIRPOWER WILL CHANGE SOMETHING IN THIS WAR ..IS JUST A DELUDED NITWIT THAT IS IGNORING REALITIES ON THE GROUND
Ukraine is losing this war with Russia and more weapons you send more Ukrainian will die in this war
"U know what, i predicted this counteroffensive would fails months ago..CNN dont have to call these so-call specialist on theor show."
"In order to know exactly the situation at the front, I always watch the news on CNN, BBC, etc. That&#39;s how I know that Ukraine is losing badly. The most insignificant Ukrainian victory will be super mediatized, inflated and praised and when in the news they only talk about theory, it is clear that there is not even a little good news for NATO, so..."
Tinder getting busy as all the Ukrainian men are gone.
"The US Air Force could sure earn some glory by striking the Russians behind their own lines. Too bad, we have decided to coddle our military when they could actually be useful."
"What are you talking about,the Ukrainian struggling a little bit in this ongoing much hype Counter offensive? In think you wrong bcoz Ukraine right now is facing a big struggling in their ongoing Counter offensive."
Omg just admit your losing
"Bravo,rusia,god,bless,rusia,the,wor,is,over,soon,bit,the,westernes,evol."
You know its bad when CNN says this 😂
Russia are sending a new electronic warfare vehicle to the battlefield which will disable all these drones.Ukraine are now using their reserve brigades meaning once these are gone Ukraine will be defenceless.The F-16s will never reach the Ukraine battlefield the war will be over inside this year.
Ukrainians have problems. 😅😅😅😅😅😅
It s over.
"Ukraine precisa 2.000 Batke Tanks Abraans, 400 airplanes f16.  In minimun."
"I wonder if this retired Colonel too working some councils, to better his rent money, for raytheon or lockheed or some other company?&quot;"
NATO and American aggressive proxy war have been failed.. Russia wins the game that&#39;s the reality 😂
America and its proxies always lose wars. 😂😂😂😂😂
Nother propaganda cnn ...let help this dumb liberal americans ...RUSSIA PUSHING FORWARD AND WINNING  UKRAINE   ... WITH AMERICAN CRAP IT WILL STILL NOT WIN THE WAR
&quot;Ukraine was struggling a little bit in this counteroffensive&quot; this is a professional journalist statement. <br>What next? Joe Biden somehow is a good president?
TV journalists are experts at real warfare 😅
Victory to Russia.
Power to Russia 🇷🇺
"So Scott Ritter was right all along? And the thought overlords banned him for offensive speech. This platform, and this, uhm, news channel, is an utter joke. Sounds like those desperate Russians armed with only shovels are wrecking US/NATO weaponary."
The Ukrainian Army is just a mess....
"The only problem of ukraine is, that the complete west did not send in time in 2021. And don t ptretend cia and others did not know what putin was planning...if ukraine is not WINNING its the fault of US and the complete west...shame that you even now don t get balls. Slava ukraini!!!!!"
You guys said the Russians are incomptent? So it is in their lows they just screwed all nato up?
Why always downplay when Ukraine (NATO) struggling a little bit they are dying close to 1k a day still you say little bit .
"The Kiev Regime has lost over 40,000 soldiers in this so-called counteroffensive. Plus, they lost nearly 75,000 in Bahkmut--that&#39;s more than the US lost during the entire Vietnam War.<br>CNN: &quot;They&#39;re struggling a little bit.&quot;"
I thought they gain terrain every day since 18 months 🤣🤣🤣 ..now they have &#39;&#39;problems to find some momentum&#39;&#39; 🤣🤣🤣
"Flying is not about the instruments ! To compare the cokpits is stupid !  The f 16 is easy to fly .  The education is all about the <br>technologies and weapon systems , radar ect !  An experienced pilot will learn this very fast <br>The efficiency of the F16 depend on the missiles that go with it !<br>Sidewinders are obsolete and will not work well anymore - Meteor will have a 100 % killrate and reach up to 200 km<br>If Ukraine get Meteor then Russia will have to rethink alle their airstrikes ogr loose many airplanes"
small drones are easy to intercept and the operator is easy to lokalize. to use a small commercial drone is dangerous because the enemy know exactly where you are within minutes
"Israel has hijacked biden administration.russian airforce is still intact<br>So israel has ordered usa to send f16 s.but if f16 s sent by usa start to bomb russia ,nobody really knows how putin will react.usa will be at war with russia  a nuclear power with 6000 warhead most aimed at us cities<br>USA wake up ,listen to trump.get your elected representatives to remove all unelected warmongers in biden administation"
"Yeah, armchair generals, only useful in dumbing down war for the idiots watching and fantasizing they have a clue what the Ukrainians are dealing with. The Ukrainians are handing the Russians their hats and convincing them to head home for the most part, so don&#39;t stop supplying them as they fight the good fight. Trench warfare on the defensive is a hard issue to overcome and the Ukrainians are making headway without pointlessly throwing away lives in mass charges, rather they are picking away at the Russians and beating them hands down. Keep supporting Ukraine."
75 thousand men life 75000 is little struggle
"How is that counteroffensive going, losers? :))"
"CNN the Most (UN)- Trusted news in the whole world,"
"I&#39;m glad this guy&#39;s retired. The issue Ukraine is facing is an enemy 3 times it&#39;s size and 5 times its economy. It&#39;s a wonder at all that Ukraine is pushing Russia back--and Ukraine IS pushing Russia back. There is very little difference in analog vs digital instrumentation between those two jets. People didn&#39;t freak out when their cars went digital. His argument is stupid. Most Ukrainian pilots can already fly the F-16, simply because they&#39;re already jet pilots. It&#39;s the NATO combined arms training that takes time and practice. It will take those kind of tactics to dislodge the heavily entrenched Russians. Russia has nothing up it&#39;s sleeve. It already spent itself in this war. They can reinforce over the winter a little bit, but next spring, Ukraine will bust loose with an air force and combined arms tactics. Russia will lose. It&#39;s meager remaining air force will not stand a chance."

"Hey, Russian bombed on Ukraine territory, the smoke from explosions is too toxic air and water mixture in the clouds is spreading on grain. Russian military must stop free shipping food that have toxin/ Shrapnel by a Bomb-blast on grains. Free food sending to Africa. They should boldly refuse to receive it. 😮"
Helping Ukraine by weaponizing the country becomes a myth. If Ukraine can&#39;t take any territory back that military help is just prolonging the war effectively increasing the Ukrainian death toll.
I see why they retired this guy
Ukraine Official: If a Fourth Mobilization is called - <b>*ALL*</b> Men -- Will Go To War
"Ukrainian&#39;s training on the F-16, an the operating system isn&#39;t the problem, that&#39;s basic, it&#39;s taking it apart and putting it back together, and finding where the glitch on the plane is, knowing the resources you do, and don&#39;t have to fix the issue. Flight time, is flight time. Again, we can complain all day about delay of supplies to Ukraine, but that&#39;s not a solution to the problem they face with a reinforced front. Ukraine never got any mine sweeper flail(s), or need to improvise some, or used remote control cars, trenches can be breech with combat bridges. Not having any proper air capabilities for air superiority hurts protection on all fronts of the battlefield. Then Ukraine is also cleaning house dealing with corruption throughout this entire war, and the politics of dealing with the United States of America, NATO, EU, an, or allied force&#39;s. While moving masses of platoons of troops for training in the United States of America, NATO, EU, an, or allied force&#39;s areas for months at a time taking away from defensive, offensive, force&#39;s for Ukraine in this war against Russia."

Its like driving a 2003 chevy then Changing to a Lambo
But i thoughtukrani was winning??
"The big problem is the lack o air supperiority to apply the combined operations taught by NATO countries. It is obvious that the delay has to do with Biden&#39;s need to prolong the war to make himself indispensable against Trump or DeSantis and thus win the election at the end of 2024. But this affects the pockets of taxpayers who are financing these weapons and minitions for the Ukrainians to take back their pre-2014 territories and, consecutively, leave the world free of the blackmailing dictator, Putin, as soon as possible."
Um....joking right?

"The Art of Infiltration - a draft Appendix written by a former soldier of the First Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1RAR) to, The Art of War’ 13 chapters by Sun Tzu.<br><br>I will begin with Sun Tzu said: be where your enemies least expect. <br><br>The earth has natural folds in the ground. <br>If you want to be unseen, stay below ground but still in the open. <br>Follow the natural path of the land to where it brings you out of its maw. <br>Here, you can remain invisible and unpredictable. <br>If you follow a straight line as the crow flies, you will be intercepted. <br><br>You must send forward a small group ahead of the main force. <br>You must not tell your soldiers of the dangers. <br>You must only tell them the objective and to use only the cover of darkness. <br>Your soldiers will focus on the objective. <br>The leader will focus on the threat. <br>If the leader is exposed, the soldiers have failed and, the splinter force will fall into the enemies hands. <br>If the splinter force is exposed, the leader has failed and must desert their soldiers to call in reinforcements for revenge. <br>They who are hunted never feels safe. <br><br>When the splinter force arrives at its infiltration point, the splinter force will fracture into even smaller groups.<br>Eyes will be planted to learn the habitat while the others will return to the main force.<br><br>To successfully infiltrate - your objective has to be infiltrated twice and thrice without raising alarm or being noticed by the local inhabitants.<br>A cooling off period will confirm the first infiltration of the eyes.<br>The ears will follow mere days later with the main force before the light of dawn.<br><br>They appear out of the fold in the ground just before the light of dawn breaks, when everything is dewy and soft under foot. <br>They don’t run but they don’t walk. Everything is depthless. Shadows within shadows. Eyes and ears with intent of following particular scents. <br>To catch hounds among dogs, you must send a fox clan to sniff them out. <br>When you dispatch a whole clan of fox’s, they can come out in the day once they have infiltrated and made their den. <br><br>If you are successful upon infiltration, you will leave no trace of tracks. <br>You will appear as if you were always there. That is a perfect infiltration. <br>If the enemy does not know the direction to send you, they cannot openly engage in honourable warfare. Your soldiers will suffer greatly for embarrassing the enemy. Your soldiers will see cunning they’ve never seen before. Your soldiers will stay up late checking and tightening. Rechecking. Constantly aware. <br>They will never tire until the mission becomes a desire for them to stay out there longer. They won’t want to come back to the rear lines. They will become too comfortable in a war zone. They will see the locals as neighbours. But to remain strong, the leader has to push the fox clan to its limits. It’s the only way to draw out the hounds. Thus is the dangers of a successful infiltration can be.<br><br>The aspect of infiltration is short notice. <br>Your team will be picked last but, for the most important effect in war - the element of surprise. <br>You will think that your inner leaders among the coalitions ranks aren’t giving you the right jobs you desire. Your path ahead of you is hidden and concealed. This is the path of infiltration. <br>If you can constantly surprise your enemy, they will constantly hesitate to attack you. <br>If the enemy cannot predict your movements then, they cannot see you even though you are standing right in front of them. <br>Thus is the power of infiltration. <br><br>To remain unseen in the open, your eyes cannot be seen though, your ears may be heard. Thus is the knowledge of infiltration. <br><br>Lastly, the morale of the infiltration - your soldiers will be good if you treat them good. While pushed deep into the enemy and unknown territories, the fox clan will have formed bonds. These bonds are strong and hold a specialised clan together. At no stage attempt to separate the soldiers bonds. <br>There will be other soldiers there who tend to stay away from the others. They look to the leadership for occasional company. Be kind to these loners as they will be your shadow in the darkest times ahead. They will not let the leadership fail as they see the clan as one collective. They will also help with morale by taking the heat from the other soldiers; the prime leader is one of the most despised people who has the honour of command. Everyone has a place on the battlefield and, sometimes the battle can become internal. <br>As a prime leader, if you punish your soldiers for their attitude whilst conducting infiltration operations, your soldiers will talk of mutiny to the other soldiers. If this talk happens, it needs to be settled quietly by informing another leader within the fox clan, they will assure the other soldiers the prime leader is making the right decisions. Trust your minor leaders because with their experience combined, it will multiply yours alone - combine your minds together and work as one regardless of your opinions. <br>To be successful in infiltration, you have to become nothing. <br><br>Infiltration is bypassing war. Infiltration is precision. Infiltration means even your own allies aren’t aware of your movements. <br>Infiltration means you go in alone and wait for the resupply. You will carry more than you ever did when you trained for this. <br>If you show your enemy that you have always been there, they won’t want to fight. This is how you get through a war zone without firing a single shot. Even though the enemy will try to take you, they cannot hit what they cannot truly see. When you capture the enemy in the act of war, you will spare them their lives. You will send them to your information gatherers. Every enemy that lives has information that is valuable. <br>If your infiltration turns into a meat grinder, your mission has failed and the hierarchy that sent you there are yet to fully understand the enemy. If your enemy is not understood or worse, disrespected and underestimated then you will fight strength against strength - there will be no diplomacy and many will die.<br>Those who have successfully infiltrated and occupied an area in a war zone with lesser ranks within their clan will never be seen again. They will remain hidden for the rest of their days. That fox clan in infiltration will be dispersed once its task is complete. Even perfection must be undone. No extra honour will be given to these soldiers. Their reward is being the vanguard. The other soldiers will fear those infiltrators whence they return homeside, not even their own kind will be able to see them amongst their ranks for they have become nothing. Thus is the heart ache of infiltration and, <br><br>Thus is the Art of Infiltration and Deception."

Struggling a little bit
If Russia attacked Ukraine with the intent on destroying it&#39;s infrastructure this war would have been over a long time ago. Ukraine simply doesn&#39;t have the air power to defend itself against a full on assault against the Russians.
"There’s so much bullshit comes through in controlled media, like to see a more balanced view with true facts. Russia has achieved its goal, Crimea secured the Black Sea, Donbas, buffer zone. Putin will not lose to Zelenski, they are there to stay and Putin probably has more support from Russian people than ever. Russia will destroy Ukraine before it becomes part of Nato, it’s probably number one cause nuclear weapon use. Eastern European countries that were under Soviet control should have formed their only military alliance with each other."
"During Joe Biden’s vice presidency, Hunter Biden sold him as ‘the brand’ to reap millions from oligarchs in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine. It appears no real services were provided other than access to the Biden network, including Joe Biden himself. And Hunter Biden seems to have delivered. This is made clear by meals at Café Milano where then-Vice President Joe Biden dined with oligarchs from around the world who had sent money to his son,” said Chairman Comer. “It’s clear Joe Biden knew about his son’s business dealings and allowed himself to be ‘the brand’ sold to enrich the Biden family while he was Vice President of the United States. The House Oversight Committee will continue to follow the money trail and obtain witness testimony to determine whether foreign actors targeted the Bidens, President Biden is compromised or corrupt, and our national security is threatened.”"

"The fix is in.  Yes, yes the economic world collapse is coming but it’s all planned.  LNG interests since the 2010’s have been gearing up to take down their two biggest competitors to the American LNG industry and investors worldwide.  The #1 collaborators with LNG interests are the uniparty DNC and RNC warmongers.<br><br>First the Obama-Biden Red States of America ‘War on Coal’, coupled with the global warming propaganda demonizing coal fired power plants worldwide by the ‘we can fix the weather loonies’, succeeded in the West but failed miserably in Russia, India and China.  China has been building 1 to 2 new coal fired power plants a WEEK since 2010, today China has over 1100 and plan to build 1 to 2 new mainland Chinese coal fired power plants well into the 2030’s.  China has the cheapest and most reliable electric power grid in the world.<br><br>Second Russia is also a huge provider of inexpensive, abundant and reliable LNG to Europe.  The Obama-Biden CIA led Kiev coup in 2014 replaced the Russian friendly elected Kiev government and put in politician’s controlled by the DC Swamp who in turn are controlled by LNG interests who in turn are controlled by the US Military Industrial Complex who Eisenhower warned us about in his 1961 very short 10 minute farewell address.  Once the CIA approved Kiev government was controlled by the DC Swamp they prodded the AZOV, the equivalent of the French’s Foreign Legend but Kiev’s Foreign Legend, to attack by artillery and armed conflict the Russian Speaking Donbas region still friendly with Russia.  After near 15,000 Donbas citizens were killed between 2014 to 2021 Putin invaded.  The final solution to the American LNG interests were put in place, the West led by the Biden administration put draconian sanctions on Russia.  Biden’s threat to destroy the Nord Stream pipeline if Putin invaded was implemented, that was the icing on the cake.<br><br>The fix is in.  LNG has cornered the energy market and is colluding to raise its LNG prices.  Economic collapse will come first to Europe and then America.  LNG investors and industry will prevail making untold billions until the economy freezes up.  As last resort to restart the massive American economy our bungling US Military Industrial Complex will try to start a non-nuclear war with Russia but mark my words it will quickly become a thermonuclear WW3.  <br><br>Watch Peter Sellers movie how I came to love the bomb."

"It is impossible for Ukraine and NATO as a whole to completely win russia, and this is something that the west needs to seriously take into considerstion. But if NATO wants to completely win russia, there will be a disaster. That is surely a nuclear war.<br>The better way to end the war is to create favourable conditions for a win-win solution by helping faciliate peace negotiation for both sides or between and among parties concerned, so that no one will completely lose or win. <br>I, we, most people in southeast asia believe resolving differences between russia and ukraine is complex and complicated becoz russians and Ukrainians had/have had very close political, economic, cultural, religious family relationships for hundreds of years. They were/are just like brothers or sisters, unlike the other neighbouring countries of russia. So why are the external powers are trying to make troubles for them? Just think about family relationships between the British and the Australian..."

Cut them off and make them settle--Russia gets something, they get something, they never join NATO, the world survives until the U.S. and China try to out-escalate each other over Taiwain in a year or two."
How many pilots will they get to train in “time”? How many f16 will they get?  What about parts? Mechanics? Will they fly from Ukrainian airfields (apparently not comparable with fragile f16). Will they fly from Poland? So after Ukraine - Poland is next to bend over for usa?  <br>Is this a joke? Romania is on the waitlist for f16 almost 10 years.

“Struggling little bit “ only cnn can say something like this.

"The US has lost its proxy war in Ukraine. Yet thousands of Ukrainians die every week because Joe Biden cannot admit defeat because it will burn his political party to the ground.<br>Ukraine received $185 billion from the West to support the US-NATO American proxy war against Russia and Biden plus has nothing to show for it. <br>Now Zelensky says it is not enough. &quot;As long as the war continues, nothing can be enough&quot;.<br>The EU must consider cutting its losses and demand urgent and realistic peace talks.<br>Biden says Russia has already lost the war because Finland and Sweden are joining US-NATO. If that is the measure of success, I would argue that the new unthinkable unplanned military alliance between powerful Russia and industrial China, with the world&#39;s second-largest real-term defense budget of $300 billion, is an immeasurable strategic loss to the West compared to adding two tiny, small-budget NATO members ( Finland at 6.3 billion dollars and Sweden at 7.7 billion dollars).<br><br>Today&#39;s reality is that the US has lost its proxy war against Russia in Ukraine. A de-militarized West is bleeding money into this black sinkhole with no end in sight. Russia outnumbers Ukraine&#39;s casualties on the battlefield 10 to 1, despite billions in military aid from the (wild) West. You can&#39;t fight a war with just money, or eat your fill with just money alone.<br><br>The Biden administration is unwilling to negotiate peace, a tragic US peace phobia. They are sending even more Ukrainians to the bloody Russian &quot;meat grinder&quot; without any hope of success. The Democrats know they don&#39;t have a chance to &quot;fix&quot; the next election if Russia wins before next Christmas 2023. That&#39;s just the way it is. Thousands of Ukrainians die every week because Joe Biden cannot admit defeat without burning his political party to the ground. See democracy at work!<br><br>Joe Biden and his warmongering team of Pipeline Blinken, Pollster Sullivan, and &quot;Fu ck the EU&quot; Nuland will be remembered as the most catastrophically inept political actors in US history. Together, they have given the biggest free gift to Russia and China: A strengthened multipolar alliance of &quot;sick to the stomach&quot; BRICS+ nations that will end US hegemony by &quot;de-dollarizing&quot; global trade and severely limiting the US government&#39;s ability to print stacks of  US Dollar for trading at the expense of other nations. It will ruin the insanely indebted US without a single shot being fired. Thank the election fraud 2020 for eventually leading up to all this!<br><br>Nuclear war? The only option other than this predictable geopolitical defeat followed by decades of US domestic economic hardship, is sadly nuclear war. Knowing past American history and how the US government acts as obedient &quot;Deep State&quot; puppets, this suicidal insanity is still the most likely outcome. They would rather launch another unprovoked  &quot;false flag&quot; attack that could end 99% of humanity rather than admit to their careless defeat in Ukraine. The surviving elites in their deep air-filtered nuclear bunkers will naturally blame Russia, Russia, Russia. The End."

The counter offensive has done virtually nothing except waste 100+ billion dollars.  I no longer support any of it. My next vote is for whichever politician says &quot;to hell with Ukraine. Let &#39;em fight with on own dime. Free lunch is over.&quot;  They had their chance and failed."
militaries contribute %5.5 percent of all global greenhouse emissions. Let&#39;s use the globalists rhetoric to either expose their hypocrisy or to end all wars. GET THIS COMMENT TO THE TOP!! END ALL THE WARS!!
The &quot;colonel&quot; is paid to talk rubbish based on hearsay. Probably on secret ruski payroll.
Big problem is the West not giving Ukraine military aid.
"Ex USAF, never been in Combat, he&#39;s a talker, not a shooter. He&#39;s employed to talk bullshit to the Upper echelon and take lot&#39;s of money for it nowadays as a &quot;Consultant &quot; 😴😴😴😴😴"
Start the training and stfu
It is not static. The Russians stated that they will liberate the 4 Russian spoken areas and so they did. That was their special military operation. If NATO wants further war then we will see further Ukrainian territories annexed.
Russians fisting the ukrie Nazis.
Cue all the brainless Russian troll sheep that will claim this is irrefutable evidence that invincible Russian military will conquer all of Ukraine in the next few months and execute all the Nazis (I.e. any Ukrainian that opposes being invaded and subjugated)🤡🤡🤡🤡🤦‍♂️
The update from CNN is poor
The average American woman now weighs 170 pounds.<br>The average Russian woman weighs 132 pounds.<br>Russia is the richer nation.
"They are fighting in a way that saves the most Ukranian lives. That way just happens to be not to charge over the 5 million mines layed out over the course of a year. Village by village, they continue to push. If the west loses this war it&#39;s Ukraine now, Poland invasion tomorrow"
"Can&#39;t do Dessert Storm Offense without air cover, need to own the sky."
Help Ukraine!!!!Ukrainian believe in you!<br>When you give F-16?!!!
A 10&#39;s plus F 16&#39;s a mix that would work for UKRAINE . SLAVA UKRAINI .
Russia is running out of artillery for over a year according to CNN😢😂😢
When will Joe Biden be brought to face the tribunal in Den Haag for crimes against humanity?
"“Subsequent conflicts in the future”. The masses will never learn and the military industrial complex marches on. I would say WW3 is looking very likely, if not already begun."
&quot;Ukraine has been struggling a little bit.&quot; You think.
"Russia is not interested in ending the war. The US and NATO would only restart the war at a later date, better prepared."
Ukraine just fired all its military recruitment officers for corruption and this isn&#39;t news for CNN agenda bias!
Whole of CNN is &quot;LA Person&quot; 🤣
So today Stian Jensen NATO chief of staff suggested that the Ukraine might have to give up some territory in exchange for NATO membership and he is absolutely right. The current situation is not like France being occupied by Nazi Germany as occurred during the Second World War the facts on the ground are rather different. The far out majority of the Ukrainians in the Donbas are ethnic Russian speaking they consider themselves Russian rather than Ukrainian and there is no benefit in forcing a Russian speaking majority to stay in the Ukraine against their will. Therefore first and foremost a ceasefire should be negotiated along the lines of the breakaway Republics Zaparohzie Donetsk Luhansk and Kherson. Subsequently a United Nations sponsored and supervised referendum should be held to have the local population decide if they want to stay in the Ukraine or alternatively join the Russian Federation. In exchange the Ukraine will become a NATO member thus safeguarding the rest of the country from any further aggression thank you very much and Slava Ukraina 🇺🇦🇵🇱🇪🇺🇺🇲🇬🇧
"it&#39;s going a bit slowly and Ukraine has only had about 25,000-28,000 casualties but soon they will succeed....or 😮"
Nobody cares about Ukraine.
So why didn’t the chickens attack all winter long rather than let Russia put those defenses in. As far as I’m conserved Ukraine is a bad investment
There  was  an  idea  to  combine  in  time  the  Truce  on  the  fronts  and  the  immediate  Accession  of  Ukraine  to  NATO  !
Mickey Mouse Colonel.
It&#39;s sad that people have lost interest in the counteroffensive.
"&quot;War Ended in Afghanistan . Give money you keep to Afghanistan .PLs &quot; . Send This to Your President,your Government.Thanks So much CNN"
"UKRAINE should Prefer 1000 MLRS, PATRIOT , Himars, Anti tank......... But dont take Abraham.  It will be of no use"
"Ukraine should stole kinzal ,Iskander .,.america  costly gift and deal F16"
Modern aircraft easier not harder to fly
"Weapons and Western military vehicles captured in Ukraine are displayed in Russia<br>More than 800 types of western and Ukrainian military weapons and vehicles captured by Russian forces in the conflict zone in Ukraine were displayed on the framework of the ARMY-2023 military exhibition in Kubinka, Moscow Region, this week.<br>Trophies displayed at this exhibition, which takes place in the Park Patriot complex, include units of military equipment such as France&#39;s AMX-10RCR armored fighting vehicles, Sweden&#39;s CV90 infantry fighting vehicles, Australia&#39;s Bushmaster protected mobility vehicle and even an XA-180 Pasi armored transport vehicle, manufactured in Finland."
Attack the Russians from the Sea of Azov.
This is the same pundit that said the war wouldn&#39;t go past one year. Smh

C-SPAN STATE RUN MEDIA RIGGED CALLS 😊
"as a result of having a president who is an idiot comedian, you know a comedian? really likes applause because of his idiotic role.... namely wanting to become America&#39;s slave.. hahahahaha...."
Ukraine struggling little bit by western media especially fake news shows how seriousness in reality is
😢😢😢
the MC women is so cute
The truth is US does not want to see F16 destroy by MIG. we all know that the MIG is superior to F16. that is the reason why US does not want to give it out to Ukraine
"The &quot;big problem&quot; is (a) unrealistic and hyped Western expectations, and (b) a trickle of weapons insufficient to turn the tide of war. What is the #1 US priority in battle? Air superiority. What does Ukraine not have? Air superiority. <br><br>The truth is that Ukraine has done an extraordinary job against a far larger, better equipped, and grossly immoral foe. But there are physical limitations in these conditions that have to be considered, adapted to, and worked around. Not doubt this guy was thinking that the war was virtually over when the Russian invaders crossed the border on August 24, 2022"
"Ukraine should <b>never</b> have existed as country , and it will <b>not exist</b> after this conflict ends."
By seeing this brief Ukraine should attack air to surface No  way to send troops meat grinder ......Ukraine air force should destroy trench to secure ground
America🇺🇸 take note..<br>You are losing countries as business partners every day (Not going to mention American corp) WHEN half the world 🌍trades with china 🇨🇳🇨🇳first America second!! we will take back TAIWAN🇹🇼 !!!!
CNN seems to be negative and non supportive of the Ukraine. The USA is full of brainless idiots who think Russia is in its rights to attack this country and CNN seems to be in this group
Ukraine has been struggling...a little bit 😂😂😂
F16s will all get shot down by S400s.  It&#39;s better to give Ukraine more MANPADs.  They&#39;re far more cost and resource effective.
Yes That&#39;s very easy for Americans to fight with modern weapons with taliban but not for russians
"comon, the west is playing ukraine.. just enough to hold on, no more.... and this was going on since first days. - if i where ukraine, i would stop and keep up the long distant attacks as well as the fear in the russians. as long they mined all their stolen land, they shit ass cant use it."
Ukraine will lose 😂
"Foreigner, I am addressing YOU.<br>Too many lies were told about us, the foreign media. Such as the CNN, DW, New York Times, WASHINGTON POST, GUARDIAN, DAILY TELEGRAPH, TIMES, WALL STREET JOURNAL, USA TODAY, Guardian, Daily Mail, USA Today, Independent, Los Angeles Times, Le Monde, Daily Mirror, Bild and some others.<br>It turned out that such a mighty country, my Homeland, can be destroyed from the inside. In the 90s, the USSR fell, it was destroyed by corrupt internal enemies who bought into the promise of wealth. The enemies turned out to be from inside the country, in power. They acted with the support of NATO countries (mainly the USA and England and France). And our population (the USSR) easily believed the words of foreigners.<br>It turns out how easy it is to live richly at the expense of other countries! The USA endlessly prints unsecured dollars (supporting their demand with the strength of its army in Japan, Germany, Israel and other countries - more than 950 bases around the world. And where the base is, the local government also obeys you)<br><br>France and England also have subordinate colonies.<br>But now Russia has gained strength and is defending its borders by conducting a special operation in Ukraine. Ukraine was once a fraternal republic to us, our grandfathers together smashed Hitler in the 2nd World War.<br>Therefore, if you want to know the Truth, read and watch the Russian media. Sputnik and Russia Today.<br>More than 50 NATO countries are fighting with Russia through the hands of strangers (Ukrainians) in Ukraine. By supplying weapons and ammunition, sending mercenaries.<br>Unfortunately, Ukrainians believed that the United States and Europe would help them in everything. But in fact, Ukrainian guys are dying for the interests of Uncle Biden and the English Queen....<br>But I know one thing - Russia will win. We are a multinational people. And when we are united, WE are INVINCIBLE!<br>So it was in 1941-1945. And now we will repeat our Victory!<br><br>Russian Partisan!)"
"It is the same as the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan 1979 to 1989, in the period 1986 to 1989, the then president with the Kremlin, the army that took part in the fighting, they knew perfectly well that this war could not be won for sure, these several thousand soldiers killed died unnecessarily and the authorities in Moscow knew it perfectly well. The current situation is exactly the same as in the period 1986 to 1989 (the last 3 years of the war). The Kremlin gives propaganda information, the message for the people is very important, extremely important!!!  (C025)"
"Joe Biden&#39;s historic Afghanistan disaster will echo through time. The Taliban celebrated its international influence, claiming to control 16 embassies around the world representing the &quot;Islamic Emirate.&quot;"
"At equal military power russains have no chance against Ukrainians. Because russians make all worse: study, work, serve in army, etc. (those who are familiar with USSR understand about). Conclusion - equal power. Russia will pay all bills at the end."
"Oh my. CNN made its name in the first Gulf War by reporting more factually than the three corporate media stations that censored, editted, &amp; dumbed down war reports.   30 years later and CNN has morphed into what it sought to differ from."
❤❤❤❤ for Russia 🇷🇺
poor CNN and So called experts 😄😄😄
Lots of putin troll accounts here
August 2023 everything he is say has happen  and there is stuff he could have said.   Russia is not the agressor with its police action in Ukraine. no USSR anymore like the US wants to keep the &quot;Cold War&quot; alive.  &quot;Cold War&quot; was over and we won except for a few in US powerful positions.
I like the MS Paint colours at the bottom of the screen.
Cope
Just looking at the map shows that Ukraine has already been properly neutered. All that&#39;s left of Ukraine for the West is a welfare state.
Isn&#39;t it funny how people still believe in these western news outlets? 😂
I know an excellent job for people like that how about mine clearing.. or they can be on Point during the trench clearing they are just a bunch of parasites the lowest of the low during wartime they deserve the full force of military law it will be no dramas if they do not come back from the front there is no place in the new Ukraine for people like that
"American super weapons always defeated  in Vietnam, Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan by poor quality Russian weapons 😂😂😂.That is why the Yankees  have jealousy  towards Russia."
Don&#39;t worry Yankees 😂😂😂. your bulldog Ukrizz will die for you by try to destroy Russia
"CNN being a bunch of pathetic liars over a war that is clearly over as Russia just sent a rocket mission to the moon and still doing counter insurgency operations in Syria. They are shooting 40,000 rounds a day vs 9,000. Liberals have destroyed this country and none of you war mongers will ever fight. You who push war are utter cowards."
Why not send F16 and send pilots on the downlow that can operate them while there pilots are getting trained. We have the best Top gun fighter pilots in the world. How will the Russians know there not Ukrainians. 😂 if for some reason they get caught they say there volunteers who are helping  Ukrainians fight for there freedom. Just saying. Im sure we have undelcared soldiers there anyway
Man the Russians need to make a statue of the winter weather in the center of Moscow and worship it like a god
Ukraine  is struggling lol Ukraine  is dieing lol
Your big problems is cnn
Did she say even an LA person like me?
"A much bigger problem that Russia is having is that the value of their currency has just collapsed. The exchange rate for a Russian ruble compared to the American dollar is now over 100 rubles per dollar saw the value of the ruble is at historic low.  I hate to say this Vladimer, but it takes a lot of money to prosecutor war.  Even when the Soviet Union collapsed in the 1980s, the exchange rate was five rubles per one US dollar so that means that the Russian ruble is now 20 times weaker than it was when the Soviet Union collapsed. If nobody wants your currency, that means you can’t buy anything outside of your country."
"give them F35! also give them the money that could have been used to help the victims in hawaii fire, glory to ukraine, glory to usa 😍😍dont stop until they take back crimea 😍😍"
Would artillery be useful in taking out the mines?
&quot; Ukraine is struggling a little bit&quot;!? Lord have mercy.
"AFU hasn&#39;t even made it to the &#39;dragon&#39;s teeth&#39; - AFU had lost long before the counteroffensive started - they weren&#39;t ready for it at all - US/UK neocons forced them to continue rather than make peace - why? - same reason they forced Kiev to leave the Istanbul peace deal - peace ends the neocon Moscow regime change project - their only purpose is to crack open the Russian Federation and get their asset stripping buddies from Wall Street and City of London dug back into the Russian sovereign wealth - the good &#39;ol Yeltsin era - a nightmare Russians never want to see again - today with Bolton&#39;s article urging the West challenge what he calls Putin&#39;s nuclear bluff, we get a clear picture oh how dangerous neocons are - neocons need be perished to the dung heap of history before they get us all killed"
Unbelievable people are still so stupid they believe these CNN lies and have not figured out the truth or even where to go for the truth.  I can not believe people Americans are as dumb and pathetic as they are.  But it is true and I am seeing it. Pitiful
Imagine English-only American pilots trying to train Ukrainian speakers on a complicated jet fighter…🤔
"This mine strategy is something we should really keep in mind for the future, you basically roll in annex territory from a country and then lay down a million mines.  very short sided and exactly what I would expect from a morally bankrupt country like Russia.  We should start development on Ukraine&#39;s nuclear program in response."
Wait…we were told in March by western media that the Russians were reduced to fighting with shovels! 😮
lock him up!!
Glory to the motherland! 🐻

Struggling a little bit?? How about going extinct!
"They come to terms with the reality that the counteroffensive is proving to be quite challenging, foreseeing a prolonged attrition war that will exhaust NATO&#39;s arsenal. There&#39;s no progress on the ground, and the Russian economy remains resilient."
"War, an ancient practice spanning millennia, remains starkly primitive. Despite this extensive timeline, a resolution to terminate these woeful occurrences eludes us. These distressing events persist primarily instigated by despotic regimes wielding an unchecked concentration of power. Notably, the leaders or privileged echelons orchestrating such conflicts remain unaccountable under constitutional frameworks to the populace who bear the brunt of enduring suffering and terror across protracted periods. The case of Ukraine serves as a poignant illustration of another instance where conflict needlessly erupted due to the ambitions of a solitary, unwell leader driven solely by the pursuit of power and affluence. As Ukrainians grapple with the loss of countless lives and the decimation of cities, they valiantly wage a struggle for survival. Regrettably, the global community observes in muted silence as this ordeal unfolds, with Ukraine&#39;s populace subjected to immeasurable losses. The provision of arms to Ukraine is doled out with deliberate restraint, aimed at preventing Ukraine from attaining a position of dominance over Russia, a capability they possess and could employ to signal a stern warning to other perilous regimes. This gesture would underscore that the intricate dilemmas posed by authoritarian governments are impervious to resolution through armed conflict. It&#39;s imperative that the reign of such regimes concludes and the impetus for war is supplanted by more constructive avenues to address the intricate challenges they engender."
THEY DON&#39;T TALK ABOUT RUSSIAN AIR DEFENCE SYSTEMS AGAINST F16s WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT F16s
They’re punching through parts of that line like butter
Yea because the Ukrainians are totally incapable of hopping off a boat from the Black Sea and encircling the front line… 😂😂😂😂
"This is brutal betrayal by CNN to the brainwashed Americans. Russia should always loose on CNN and Ukraine should always win regardless of the facts on the front line. These so called experts and news readers should not change their narrative at any cost at any point of time, no matter what happens on the ground. People have lost lives and money due to CNN&#39;s bogus narratives every single day of this war. Sorry CNN, you are not allowed to change your stand, else You Tube better ban you guys. Everyday we need you to say Ukraine is winning exemplary and Russia is loosing terribly. 😆"
"If USA started to train Ukrainian pilots a year ago, those pilots would be an experts on f16 by now. For some non understandable reason USA still refuses other NATO countries to start training. I am extremely disappointed with USA practice to give so much needed by Ukraine weapons so the can win this devastating and started for no valid reason by Russia war. It really very simple - Ukraine protects nato and Europe. And btw, when you need to defend your homeland and your families, it’s really give you drive to learn quickly. Ukrainians proved this many times with different types of weapon. For me it looks like someone is trying to make this war last as long as possible. Treason?"
“I want people to stop dying” DJT
"I always pray to Lord Jesus Christ every day for peace negotiations..talking to each other looking for  peaceful solutions..Lord Jesus Christ the true Lord..who died on the cross to atone for sins and rose again on the 3rd day..only Lord Jesus Christ the way to  eternal life (father house) or heaven,,,,,,,.....He really hate nuclear weapons,,because nuclear weapons  is  big sins..big sins is the eternal fire of hellfire..because nuclear weapons is very terrible weapons..nuclear weapons  are  big sins..big sins is the eternal fire of hellfire..nuclear power plant is big sin..ballistic missiles and hypersonic missiles is big sins..nuclear power plant is big sins...nuclear weapons is big sins..big sins is the eternal fire of hellfire..because nuclear weapons is very terrible weapons"
Joe Bidens war in Ukraine is botched. Another great failure of the marshal Kim Jong Biden
"Lol F16 are not going to make any difference in the war. Russia is not Iraq, afghanistan etc. Also 3/4 of Russian submarines are fitted with new  nuclear power 200 megaton zircon missiles. 😅😅😅😅😅"
Nato&#39;s war on Russia
&quot;Oh TOTALLY!&quot;
These guys said random BS like a month ago
"A big reason on why the Counter offensive has been delayed was a breach in OPSEC especially by the retired Generals and Admirals you guys keep providing the Russians ideas on how to block and stop the counter offensive. Because of your constant yapping. What ever happened to OPSEC?  As a retired enlisted veteran. you Generals and Admirals shoved OPSEC down our throats until it came out our butts like a Play Doh factory.... But today it&#39;s ok? Didn&#39;t you idiots learn anything from Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan that the constant flapping of the lips can have a negative effect on operations? DUH!!! Or what are the sanctions against Russia preventing them from watching CNN and Western News Media? Just Stop it already. Just explain the results and stop your analytic predictions and what if scenarios. It all sounds cool but it isn&#39;t helping the Ukrainians much."
RUSSIA IS GOING TO THE RIVER 💯👍👍
"<b>Why is general Shyguee back in North Korea last week begging &quot;KIM-ILL-WIND for more weapons and shells??? Remember Russia is an Isolated Economy without access to the WORLD BANK or the IMF. That&#39;s way they went bankrupt in 1991 after Ronny Reagan Spent $1.8T in 1988 on his &quot;STAR WARS&quot; program. The West outspent Russia plain and simple. This will happen AGAIN in 4 or 5 years With NATO&#39;s 1 Billion people now spending 5.8 Trillion a year on weapons compared to Russia&#39;s aging and tiny population of only 138,000,000 people. Russia knows this is a &#39;TIME GAME&#39; and they will go bankrupt 101% for-sure. Smart people already know this. In 5 years Russia&#39;s only play is going to be Nuclear and that&#39;s too risky even for them since it’s a LOSE/ LOSE for everyone. China would LOVE this outcome since they would be on top of the world just like the USA was after WW2!!!!</b>"
The problem with ukraine is they had no airforce wtf those trenches are easy to target using advance fighter jets
All the world should make sure usa has a free and fair election coming soon and Americans will personally end this war with who we pick..
Russian Air Power Dominates the Front Line.
Lol this how it all starts they go from theres a delay to sturggling abit then when russia claims victory the west and Ukraine go into denial calling it a lie then after abit they like oh russia has made progress lol and admit defeat its the same old over and over
But liar incompetent Joe Biden said Putin had already lost the war back in June 2023.  Fact checked.
“Oh totally even a dumb person like me from LA know this “
"Ukraine absolutely does NOT NOT NOT NOT need F-16 fighters.  If they are getting shot down with the MIG-29&#39;s then the F-16 will suffer the same fate.  I wish Ukraine would focus on a particular portion of the battlefield and commit a large force to break the lines.  Once the lines break, then the Russians will retreat."
Ukraine has done great with what they have to work with
"The magnanimous one! The grandiose! And the victorious Russian nation over would-be global rulers. Wait who to talk to!<br><br>For the first time in history, the US Navy, Army and Marine Corps are without a leader in the Senate<br>The retiring chief of naval operations, Admiral Mike Gilday, gave up command today (14), so the Navy, Army and Marine Corps are still without a representative.<br>This Monday (14), the United States Navy became the third branch of the country&#39;s Armed Forces to no longer have a leader confirmed by the Senate for the first time in history."

EVERY MODERN ARMY ON EARTH NEEDS AIR POWER AIR SUPPORT!!! GIVE THEM JETS ATTACK HELICOPTERS WTF!!!!!!!!!
"<b>You are either evil or ignorant (hard to tell with CNN viewers) if you support corrupt, dictatorial, Christian-persecuting, church-closing, anti-democratic, political opposition-jailing, ethnic Russian-genociding Ukraine.</b>"
I have close friends in Ukraine. They said they have lost.
Go to hell with Ukraine! Why is the land of the free so against the freedom of Donbas people? Just coz Russians are helping them doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t deserve freedom.
"Add to that Ukrainian Army is extremely corrupt, Zelensky recently  fired ALL Army Recruiters because of corruption, With this kind of People fighting for Ukraine I wonder how much Billions of Dollars of money that the West poured into Ukraine has been swindled by the Ukrainian politicians and Army Generals. Note: Before the War Ukraine was one of the Most Corrupt countries in the World, and looking at the news that is been coming out of Ukraine with ALL military Recruiters getting FIRED in Ukraine for CORRUPTION I do not think Situation much changed in Ukraine."
&#39;struggling a little bit&#39;? You westerners really wanna see the complete annihilation of Ukrainian men.
"Give them some older bombers with large payload’s and sufficient air-ground support.They can blow the hell out of the defensive line’s ,then follow up with their ground offensive.Might be more training friendly and easier to maintain for the Ukrainian forces"
"The counter offensive is stuck in the mud. The Russian defense ministry claims to have destroyed 46,000 of Ukraine&#39;s troops in 2 months of fighting. This is an utter massacre and Ukraine is continuing to send in more fighters. And yet no one is talking about Ukraine surrendering. No wonder 50 million or so fighters died in World War II."
🖕🖕🖕🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🖕🖕🖕🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺
"Retired Colonel Cedric Leighton does an excellent job in his war updates and analyses. I am not a military expert and I have never served in the armed forces, but this is what I hear about the Ukrainians as far as learning modern weapons. NATO countries love teaching Ukrainians because for them they are an &quot;A&quot; list country meaning that they learn fast. An F16 might seem like an incredible jump from the soviet-era jets they are flying, but when your country is getting blown up, and you are a fast learner to begin with, you can pick anything up. America&#39;s favorite General the Retired General David Petraeus says that America would never go on a counteroffensive without G-9 Bulldozers to unearth those murder holes, Warthog planes that with their 50 caliber machine guns which are the number one terror-weapon for taking out machine gun nests and eliminating wandering enemy forces, Attack Apache choppers would be cleaning up trenches and supply vehicles and tanks and B52s would be carpet bombing the minefields and trenches. F16s and the latest jet fighters would be taking out artillery batteries. Naval gun ships would be peppering the area with every kind of rocket you can think of---and then American troops would be sent in with M1 tanks so powerful they would blow any Russian tank out of commission in minutes. We have not supplied the Ukrainians with any of these weapons systems and we have the gall to ask them why things are going so slow when no modern army in the world would attempt a counteroffensive against the world&#39;s 2nd Superpower without the above-mentioned list of kit. We are asking the Ukrainians to go into a battle no modern army would ever attempt..."
Dude....all of Ukraine men are dead....move on
"&quot;From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.&quot; Matthew 4:17 <br><br>&quot;Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.&quot; Matthew 5:38-39 <br><br>&quot;And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.&quot; Matthew 6:5-6"
We know Ukraine has been struggling a little bit ?
The evils united states and the NATO 🇪🇺 American vassals terorist has turned Ukraine into a Graveyard.🇷🇺✌️🤣😂🤣

"CNN has been one of the main channels bending over backwards to give fabricated news to mislead the western public.  CNN&#39;s credibility is therefore damaged as it has just acted as a supporter of the US government.  As Prof. Chomksy has said about media, it acted as an agent to manufacture consensus.<br><br>Now the reality has dawned that Ukraine and the west face defeat.  We know the next step : start the blame game, Ukraine is at fault and not really the US which encouraged the illusory belief Ukraine could defeat Russia, and Russia was weak economically and militarily."
"That&#39;s ridiculous, both analog and digital displays give you the same information. A automatic watch and a digital watch will give you the time.  F-16 training is hampered because of language barriers not because Ukraine&#39;s pilots lack ability to fly a fighter jet with a digital display.  Only the uninformed wouldn&#39;t have a hard time understanding that comparison."
"Meanwhile in America,  Jokin Joey Biden shoots down a Chinese balloon with not one, but two $250,000 missile&#39;s AFTER it crossed the United States! 😂"
F16 fighter jets up against Russian air defence systems… they will be turned into scrap metal
No surprise the war is taking long Russia spent 10 years in Afghanistan Russia is losing alot more soldiers in Ukraine than Afghanistan.
A lazy man blames his tools.
Bla vo👏👏👏👏👏👏
Go go forward Russia 💪💪💪🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
We can thank President Biden for the dithering.  Ukrainians are needlessly dying because of Biden&#39;s indecisiveness!
If you can’t break through with frontal attacks go around the end or find a way to land behind the Russian defenses and knock them out from behind.
"It&#39;s in the interests of the US MIC for hostilities to drag on for years, so it can hand over more over-priced junk hardware to UKR while lobbying Treasury for more replenishment as stocks run low. This is the US gameplan - pick another target for a 10yr-20yr war and make sure it proceeds in the best interests of the MIC lobbyists, which is in turn with a broader agenda."
...aliens have arrived from Uranus
Very good for visiting Western journalists! Russian exposure! NATO equipment captured by the Russian Army in Ukraine will be displayed at the 2023 Army Forum
Future Drone wars… Terminator days are upon us…
Biden has to grow some balls and give them the planes and anything else that will make the difference between just holding there own and finally end this horrible war
Finally the cnn is also agreed that the counter offensive is not successful.

ukraine already lost war
"..still the red looks like upside down rabbit it is too skinny the cute rabbit ...hey , the red rabbit (finally) ran the race&quot; ...that&#39;s for &quot;r&#39;s&quot; speech class not me i just recall i like metaphor surprises in life , they hit  sometimes...."
Utter BS Give them the F-16’s
"she could do much better...looks like edit: i meant she can do better than cnn , wasted potential everywhere...."
CNN treats its commentators like dogs.
"Yeah, give them AIR power!! 🤨 they  are being shelled by cruise missiles  launched from 300+ km away, and Russians had time to deeply entrenched and mine the whole place!! They have to fly over those mines!! 🤨🤬"
"U think US cities can get some of that Ukraine&#39;s money ,"
...&quot;... the tiny drones are useful for searching whether there&#39;s enough children to eat and the drone noises can be useful to stimulate the adrenochromal blood presacrificially....&quot;
...they probably use the tiny drones to spy on the &quot;goy&quot; and kill them is all all internal uses ....
"It&#39;s time to snuff out the lives of more Russian civilians, any innocents have had 10x more time than necessary to leave. And until they&#39;re dying by the millions, they will continue to support the war in large numbers. The outdated ideas about war crimes need to be revised, this nonsense we&#39;re seeing today is NOT a legitimate application."
"ukraine has no water no plumbing food whatever and artillery , that part could slow a offense down the landmines and that too and a philosophy contrary to the laws of nature as defined by man in his science definition of natural law he called &quot;Physics..."
Nazi criminals of Jewish crime cartel and lies mashine CNN must be tried for inciting genocide allover the world and crimes against humanity. Nazi propagandists of CNN go look for WMD in Irak.

"how s the f16 harder when you don&#39;t even have to look down , i call bs , bs news"
The Russians have had years to dig in.
...you have digital speedometer you have analog no big sh*t and also the teenager flew an f16 in the hollywood and they should not have shown zelenskyy if it was not so....
Make it more easy: the one &quot;big problem&quot;: USA does not give F-16s until now.
Germans deployed around 1000 airplanes in the battle of Kurskto hardly soften the three layered mined trenches Ukrainian have none of t
70% to 80% of the civilians in those occupied regions in Ukraine are Russian.
Mo money mo money no money . Gl.
Been hearing for a year was winning tho ? 🤔
"everyone but the mainstream news talked about the difficulties of such an offensive months ago and went into far more detail, but now that the ukrainian offensive has fallen on its face we get a comparison of cockpits between mig29&#39;s and f16&#39;s? lets go brandon!"
"If you&#39;ve used MS flight sim which many of these pilots probably would have, it&#39;s not too complex for them. The bigger problem is their English skills, which would effect heir learning rate."
Big Problem is that Ukraine is getting their butts kicked!  Send another $40 billion to Ukraine but no aid to Hawaii!
"The Ukrainian offensive is running out of steam. It is late summer and major objectives have still not been taken. It is beginning to look like the 1914-1918 Western Front, with no end in site. Escalation could have serious consequences for Ukraine."
"<b>Biden has $225 BILLION for Ukraine, but “no comment” on the Hawaii fires.</b>"
"CNN&#39;s typical lineup of left wing losers and hasbeens like Clapper and Comey. <br>In case you don&#39;t know this, it&#39;s customary in the military to promote a good full bird colonel to brig.general upon retirement so he can collect a lot more tax payer money.  This one wasn&#39;t deemed &quot;suitable&quot; for promotion.  Wonder why?  Well, the military hates stealth left wing CNN/MSNBC watching officers."
"Ukraine already has lost more than 400.000 soldiers. That failed Nazi-state is already in ruins. When the US is done making enough money out of this war, it will leave."
"Miss Reporter &quot;Ukrane is Struggling a little bit&quot; That has cost them 43000+ innocent people Lives wasted all dead.😢 <br><br>But you guys don&#39;t give a fuck about Ukrainian lives, because Why? Each and every day after working your safe and sound family members would be waiting for you at home."
"Я русская, но мне жаль, как к украинцам относятся на Западе. Как к пушечному мясу. Вы как будто футбол смотрите и комментируйте."
I hope i&#39;m proven wrong but it doesn&#39;t seem likely that the Ukrainians will be able to break up the russian occupied land corridor to crimea before the upcoming fall mud season.
Very poor reporting not qualified at all that lady should be fired
"So according to CNN, the Ukrainians are dumb."
Not struggling a little bit but very much they have received very heavy deaths casualties and lost of machinery they are just losers 😊
"I&#39;m waiting for NATO to start sending as many F16s, F35s and F22s as possible so they&#39;ll finally stf up when they realize what it means to actually go up against a country that has the largest integrated air defense system on earth and they watch their beloved perception of their ability to project power burn and fall from the sky.<br>Every sortie would be a pilots fight for their life. This is NOT Saddam Hussein or Al Qaeda.<br>Sure Russia got off to a pathetic start. They invaded with 160,000 troops (compare that to the 1 million we used to invade Iraq during Desert Storm). Now the Russians have over 750,000 there and have mobilized absolutely vast amounts of equipment.<br>If you enjoy watching Ukrainians (and Russians) die, and want to see if a nuclear war may start, then just keep on listening to Brandon. Ukraine is FINISHED and there&#39;s not a thing NATO can do."
"Get is Right, STOP CALLING THIS A WAR, IT&#39;S GENOCIDE..."
Those washing machine guided missiles with shovel warheads seem more effective than anticipated.
Lets just end this endless war

fake news. fake map. ukraine winning
The history of post-Soviet Ukraine is a consistent chain of betrayals that led to neo-Nazism. Ukraine is doomed!
We can see why the Americans defeated and conquered Afghanistan
"America doesn&#39;t know how to help win a war, only how to prolong it and leave abruptly with no plans"
Saying the &quot;more advanced&quot; F-16 is hard to learn than the MiG-29 because it has more electronics in it is like saying a Tesla is harder to drive than a Mustan from 1960
Underestimating Ukranian pilots is a fools errand. Cut them lose on the Russians with F-16&#39;s and they will break their will.

This post will be unpopular. Ukraine lost this War the moment Russia crossed the border. Ukraine is toast.
"What a load of bloody guff. May as well face reality. Ukraine has been losing this war for months. The Russians have the upper hand by far. You wonder why Zelensky has not been killed yet by the Russians? He is their biggest asset. He is making so many extraordinary mistakes because of his lack of experience that the Russian military have no wish to get rid of him when he is constantly playing to Russia&#39;s strengths. Why knock him out when single-handedly he is doing so much to help Russia win this proxy war between the U.S. / NATO and it&#39;s allies?<br><br>Coupled with the fact that the Russians have by far the best air defense system in the world no amount of drone attacks by Ukraine is going to make an iota of difference on the ground and Ukraine cannot hope to win the war using this terrorism strategy which simply detracts from reality on the front line where the real battle is taking place. Notwithstanding the fact that Ukraine have lost tens of thousands of troops in this counter offensive operation. The Russians are &#39;enjoying&#39; a kill rate of 10 Ukrainian soldiers to 1 of their own. In some locations on the front line this number is even higher at a 14:1 ratio.<br><br>The writing is on the wall. The U.S. have lost this war already. No amount of political propaganda positioning Russia as weak and ineffectual is going to make a blind bit of difference to the final outcome of the war. Ukraine will lose / has lost already. If this is not true, how come  Zelensky in real terms has made so little progress in territorial gains on the battle field? A few tens square miles. Big deal. Russia still holding all of the land (and resources). If Ukraine and the U.S. / NATO were as powerful as they like to make out is the case, where is the evidence of their storming in and regaining vast swathes of territory lost? The evidence isn&#39;t there because Russia by far is the stronger military force. <br><br>The evidence speaks for itself. The U.S. have lost yet another war and spent a colossal amount of money on it whilst their own country falls into disrepair as the economy based on their fiat currency evaporates into thin air and your people suffer the consequences / fall out from a government in way over their collectives head&#39;s without a clue what they are doing. The U.S. is being led by a contemptuous fool and the rest of the world knows it."
F-16’s are 12 months late (presently)
“Struggling a little bit” that’s how news anchors talk about a generation of young men being ripped to oblivion by artillery.
The challenge for Ukraine and it’s sponsors is to determine how much to hold back and how much to commit into the offensive. Because you know as soon as this counter offensive runs out of steam Russians will just pour in and capture everything east of Dniper river. And based on what’s left of Ukrainian military won’t be surprised if Wagner goes for Kiev. Either way as Bolton said this morning all we have done is prolong the Ukrainian defeat and the talk of Ukrainian win is nothing but a grand lie.
Massive loses is just struggling a little bit. FAKENEWS CNN 😅😅😅UKRAINE HAS LOST 43000 Soldiers and they have not seen the dragon&#39; teeth yet...
"The government recently announced new aid to Ukraine in the amount of $250 million.<br>Our country is on fire, and we support a foreign country.<br>Seriously, Ukraine already receives more money from us than any of our US states!<br>Maybe make ukraine our 51st US state?"
"The government has announced a new monetary &quot;aid&quot; to Ukraine in the amount of $250 million.<br>Let&#39;s make Ukraine our 51st US state!<br>We maintaining Ukraine like any other of our states usa.<br>Seriously, count how many billions of dollars Ukraine has already received from us in 2 years! That&#39;s more than in any usa state!"
Propaganda in...3.. 2... 1
Ukraine needs airborne to drop behind the Russian lines.
"Russian Navy will receive 5 more ships, including one for Poseidon nuclear submarine drones. The destroyer of naval bases. That&#39;s 100 megatons in the Poseidon underwater drone! United States, England and their NATO licking bags are lucky that Vladimir Putin is the president at the height of the great, magnanimous and victorious Russian nation, over would-be global dominators."
🇷🇺🇮🇳
"Watching both western and Russian Media reports from the frontline in Ukraine I notice western reporters wearing &quot;PRESS&quot; sign on their chests and backs, but Russian reporters wear no signs and I see it as a very important feature. A &quot;PRESS&quot; sign is not supposed to be targeted and destroy among civilized countries and Russia follows that rule, but for Ukraine&#39;s troops &quot;PRESS&quot; sign is a preferable target. Moreover when interviews are taken from Russian soldiers they mostly use veils covering their faces lest Ukraine’s intelligence would go after their relatives abusing them up to destroying those people. Ukraine’s soldiers have never covered their faces, as Russia dos not pose any threat to their relatives. I don&#39;t believe to what both sides proclaim, but I watch for small details that tell much more than any propaganda. As I possess both Russian and Ukraine language skills I can watch their medias and I participate in appropriate social networks. My impression of Ukrainians is very negative. They are very little educated and demonstrate much arrogance and aggression. My conclusion is that Ukraine&#39;s military is not a civilized army, but rather hordes of barbarians that despise any rules of war very much like ISIS. How can civilized countries support Ukraine? Civilized cannot, only evil and barbaric ones. Why dose the Empire of Lies with its accomplices support those terrorists? They have always supported any forces to cause Russia as much harm as they can even to destroy Russia if possible."
If some countries from Africa join Russia in this fight... Ukraine is done
An ex war pig 🐽
Those Trenches are one of the reasons Cluster Munitions are needed. Nothing clears a trench like a good-old cluster bomb.  :)
Progress? Did you see those tiny specks?  That&#39;s your progress. 🤣🤣
Give Ukrainians weapons they need - they will win this war in a couple of weeks. Americans are responsible with all the ill doings of their politics to force Ukraine to give up their nuclear arsenals in 1990s in exchange for “guarantees” of security from any aggression.<br>For several years you allowed putin’s regime to thrive and conduct aggressive actions against other post soviet countries.<br>Russia is still at the security council in UN - what a joke!  I have no respect for the USA.
"What he seems to be saying is, the us army wouldn&#39;t even try....which is what they have been saying all along"
"Same analysis, same things, and same expert!😢 How many times?? People are really getting annoyed"
Could they not adapt migs with. New avionics
"It&#39;s at the point of novel combat innovation. Until you fight in a manner that is totally different from what is anticipated then there will be no advance. It&#39;s a militarily historic situation, you have to change the game to defeat Russia. M.A.D. macro armor doctrine, or nukes. ☠️"
They struggle because we the Western countries are cowards…..simple!
"Sorry this is just a excuse not to give modern fighter to experienced aviation fighter pilots, these are not new recruits. The west is making it easy for Russia to defend no more excuse USa give them the F16."
Ukraine keep telling the world where is their conter offensive start... That why russia knew this and they are prepard<br><br>Just remind me of midway ww2
"Well things aren’t going so well, imagine that ! Lol"
💙💛
"This past month the battles have been fierce. Not a day goes by without lots of new combat video on all the various military blog sites. One thing stands out to me: BOTH sides are making fewer and fewer mistakes. The &quot;Bradley Square&quot; from June, with Ukrainians running into each other, hitting mines, getting blown up with ease; that doesn&#39;t happen anymore. They are still losing vehicles, but they are losing them while attacking, not because they are jumbled up running into each other. The Russians are experienced, that is obvious. Like the Swedish CV-90s that were knocked out and captured last week...the video clearly shows them attacking and firing, but the RPG round comes from the side, not the front. That means the Russian soldier WAITED until the CV-90 passed him before firing, knowing his round had better penetration chances to the side than the front. FPV drone video shows both sides often fly past a vehicle, then turn around to hit it from the rear as most vehicles have less armor in the rear and ex-Soviet ones in particular carry their fuel in the rear. If NATO sends in their troops, it will be a year of them being slaughtered before they gain the experience necessary to survive."
the only negativity i see on the internet re the ukrainian counter offensive are from the liberal media outlets.   obvious they have an agenda    BOO!!!!!!
"The Persian cat, black and white or blue?"
"Yes the old Russian planes and the F16 are very different, but the F16 does not make a difference. Russia has the best air defence. The first 6 Ukrainian pilots are expected to be ready by summer 24, because they first have to learn that technical English first. However apart from air superiority, the Russians have more artillery and outnumber Ukrainians by 1 to 3 up to 1 to 7. That is the range I can not get exact numbers. Ukrainian recruits get  between 2 and 4  weeks training wich clearly is not enough, so they die fast In a situation like this Ukraine should defend, but US pushes for attack."
"Nazi murderers of CNN, fight till last ukrainian, there are still Ukrainians left !!!"

Why should Ukraine advertise it&#39;s strategy to the Russians?
Blahh blahhh this isn&#39;t iraq afghanistan panama haiti countries with out a Navy air force. If you this great you would&#39;ve being called for dudy. 😭😭😭😭😭
"Russia&#39;s ISR – intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance – strike force is by now the best on the planet, and a few dozen &quot;F-16s&quot; will not change this. <br><br>Moreover, Russia&#39;s air defense capability is unparalleled, making the introduction of these 4th generation fighters all but a moot point for Ukraine."
So Russia is defending themselves against a hyped counteroffensive? Wow
"There is no way Ukraine will be able to fly and maintain F 16. You can take that   to the bank.I stand by that assessment. Has got nothing to do with bravery or commitment, which Ukraine has."
&quot;Struggling a little bit&quot; 😂
"It is sad that Congress is ignoring the majority of Americans who do not want to give Ukraine more monies and weapons.  It shows how bought off Congress and the administration  is by defense contractors and  the oligarchy in America.  Worse yet, our msm only  parrots what  these folks say."
it&#39;s actually quite strange.. the USA which is like on the other side of the world is so involved in Ukraine.. while other countries which are just as far away are not.. why is that really? why does it feel like the US is always privy to every war across the globe?
ukraine bravo and freedom

"Land mines, millions of them between the russians and the Ukranians. <br>No air support. This is killing UA soldiers by the thousands. Humans doing what should be done with aircraft and bombs."
"It&#39;s hard to advance if there&#39;s 5 mines per 1 square meter (like there reportedly is, on worst areas) and no air support. West delayed their weapon support for too long. Allowing Russia 6+ months to mine everything. Ukraine needs ATACMS, lots of demining equipment/training and F-16. Give them something to destroy the Kerch bridge, to cut off Crimea. So, in other words, give the ATACMS. They already know how to use HIMARS, it&#39;s just different warhead. UK already gave Storm Shadow, no escalation. <br><br>If West doesn&#39;t take the gloves off, this will last forever until Ukraine runs out of heroes. Every waited day, some Ukrainian heroes die. Until nothing is left. The clock is ticking for West, not for Russia. Putin won&#39;t run out of men, and won&#39;t hesitate to send them all to their deaths."
Sure send f-16&#39;s. <br>Russia will be happy to  shoot down the US&#39;s  65 million dollar apiece planes.
"They should have had planes a long time ago.  The US is always behind on the weapons they send over, then months later they send them.  Pretty annoying that this has not changed."
Let’s bring McDonald’s to the commies 🇺🇸
"Everyone in  the US knew the Russians built this as it was being built and acted like Ukraine would just blow thru them now they say something different. Total incompetence, lies and propaganda got the west where they are today with this disaster and total tragedy for the Ukrainian people."

Rehash of old news. This host is obviously a novice. CNN needs to be at the forefront not behind the latest news.
Static for 8 months? In that period Ukraine lost more territory including Bakhmut. So static
"Little problem, Big problem. <br>Figure out which one is it? <br><br>No they haven&#39;t even reached the dragon teeth.  Of course they lost 43k KIA and probably another 50-80k injured and probably 5000 surrendered. <br>That&#39;s how things haven&#39;t changed."
"The only big problems are the feeble support we give them.  These retired colonels have some guts showing their face on TV while realizing not a single western army would go on an offensive with that amount of weaponry.  The US spent countless of billions in Afghanistan, trying to implement democracy on retards that will never be able to start the simplest form of modern civilisation.  And all the time they closed their eyes on the real enemies of the west."
Nothing democats leaders love more then a good war.

Get those f16s to Ukraine now.
Ukraine struggling in this offensive lol that’s a massive understatement….. they have failed the counteroffensive
What could go wrong training a pilot in a brand new aircraft that is decades ahead of its old plane technology wise. This sounds like a great plan.
Russia&#39;s obviously very concerned with this Ward they&#39;re flying to the moon right now
"The pilots should gave been trained already for months, this is a war ,no game <br>F16’s, long range missiles and probably possibilities to attack troop concentrations over the border when needed.<br>Can’t fight a war/ it’s you or me , as if you control the intensity to your likenings forever …especially not against army no2 as it was .<br>Tied one arm to the back-&gt; being disappointed in progress-&gt;pressing ukraine to accept landlost-&gt; russia won land again and restarts again another time/ place in europe ?"
"The guy didn&#39;t anticipate that the next questions will be about &quot;F16&quot; and then about &quot;drones&quot;. It just happened that those buttons were on the screen, waiting to be pressed."
"While Ukraine waited for western weapons, Russia built up defence lines."
We just need to send them more money come on jack.
"Have a blonde that would not know a tank from a ship , but she&#39;s pretty. <br>Typical CNN"
Victory to Ukraine. Victory to West. ✌❤💙💛🇺🇦🇺🇲🇪🇺

Ukraine cant match the fight against this giant 😂😂😂😂
Attack Russian Territory Directly so Russia has to move their forces back to Russia. Moscow would be my main target
"Russia has worked very hard to destroy the west for 70 years, Putin continues that same meglomania it is unbelievable that the US politicians wants Putin to survive, why else does it refrain from providing the weapons needed to smash the russian military. 31 US tanks promised 8 months ago have still not been delivered .. this number of billions often mentioned includes all the stuff never delivered"
People in the comments think the air force will solve it. Russian air  defence are very good. They will most liked destroy them.
Basically ukranians getting slaughtered big time.<br>America and the west playing Ukraine and they don&#39;t see that. Time will come  Russia gets its land and Ukraine stays with thousands dead and nothing accomplished .
The only real problem is the extreme mining of huge areas. This in itself is a war crime... Ruzzia is just the incarnation of foul play and scum.
This colonel is a Russian bot.
All russia has to do is trow soldiers at the problem. Its a nation of millions of people. Without air ctrl Ukraine cannot go in an offensive that can make use of its superior equipment. Russia multilayered defense is meant to polarize the usa senate and give time to Russian foreign agents to turn nato against Ukraine.
Why did they rip off the screen on the mig 😂😂😂😂 cnn will always be a joke lmaooo
"In 2014 president Barack Obama called the Ukraine “the most corrupt country on the planet.“ He appointed his vice president, Joe Biden, to go over there and clean it up so America could one day use the Ukraine as a new northern NATO frontier, as well as get control of all of its rich natural resources. Hopefully, your education about the Ukraine and Russia goes back to 2014 when Volodymyr Zelenskyy was installed by coup with assistance of the United States, and who had imprisoned 11 of his political opponents? And had also started genocide in his own eastern provinces, including the Donboss? The same little green-shirted  dictator that sponsored the Azoff unit in the southern Ukraine, which was a Nazi group. The same little Fidel Castro impersonator that started chatting about joining NATO after he specifically agreed not to do so in the Minsk Accords?  The ex-movie/comedy star who has been selling our weapons on the black-market to such an extent that we’ve had to send in inspectors making sure our stuff actually got to the battlefield? Meanwhile, we’re out of ammo and we’ve already exhausted our strategic petroleum reserves? Here’s your assignment for tonight; look this up:…”RS 28 SARMAT.”"
Give those F16&#39;s to Ulrainians ASAP.<br><br>They need them. They deserve them.<br><br>(let&#39;s not forget Memorandum of Budapest)
"Does Ukraine have 8,000# missiles?  Where are they?  If so, when do they use them.  That will break through any defense line making a 400 yard hole and wiping out everything within almost a half a mile of the detonation."
This journalist is clueless. &quot;State of play?&quot; She thinks war is basketball.
"It is pure propaganda for the dumb western masses, nothing else. The ruling elite think of the masses as dirty dumb children that need to be lied to."
"You don&#39;t talk about the Spy Satellites that are winning the war showing all the Ruzzie positions.  Last year 4 US Satellites went over Ukraine daily, and one stationed permanently over Ukraine.   Japan even knows everything Russia is doing thru spy satellites maybe connected to US links.  Other satellites are doing more.  So, the bottom line is that Russia has not chance.  Putin knows it.  Last year he talked about taking out the Spy Satellites and for some reason decided that was not a good idea.  Musk may have had something to do with that.  No telling how many satellites are now spotting Ruzzies."
See More Hirsch says pilots have been training for months at many secret locations across the world like Indonesia for one.
"Between 1965 and 1975, the United States and its allies dropped more than 7.5 million tons of bombs on Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia—double the amount dropped on Europe and Asia during World War II. Pound for pound, it remains the largest aerial bombardment in human history."
Trench Warfare.
"Well, it certainly didn&#39;t help that the area where the Ukrainians chose to attack was extremely easy to predict, and that the offensive lacked any operational security due to the media hyping it up so much over the last several months. It&#39;s almost like they wanted the offensive to fail so that the war can go on even longer."
"Hold those CNN recruiters<br>Ukrainians pay up to $10,000 to avoid conscription: British media<br><br>According to reports in the Financial Times, nearly 20,000 Ukrainian citizens were prevented from leaving the country following an order by Vladimir Zelensky regarding regional recruiting chiefs.<br>Thousands of Ukrainians paid high bribes to &quot;corrupt army recruiters&quot; to avoid being conscripted in the midst of Russia&#39;s special military operation in Ukraine, reports the British newspaper Financial Times (FT) on Friday (11)."

"Ukraine  cant defeat Russia,  unless NATO deploy NATO troops. But they cant do that, that&#39;s why Russia will win this war"
This guy is to wash my dishes
🇺🇸👏🇺🇦🦸
Ukraineistan has been born . Russians have to pay every day while in-country
I didn&#39;t know this war is still going on.
Cnn loves pushing the narrative that ukraine is failing.
You wasted trillions of dollars...The Ukranians are dead and dont have the men for a counter offensive because those following non propoganda know they put all there eggs in one basket defending Baukmut...Nato is going in or this is ending soon..You talk about Russian deaths and they outman Ukraine 100-1...If you talk about Ukranian deaths you&#39;ll realize there are no men left...SIMPLE MATH.
"The real problem is the US has very different goals from Ukraine, Ukraine wants to win this war, the USA is seeking for Ukraine to wear the Russian troops down but not to win, Americans want Ukraine to accept a ceasefire or negotiate a treaty, which enables Russia to hold onto Ukrainian land."
"It would Take a million fresh troops and a Trillion Dollars to push Russia back, and if it got to that they would consider it existential, and use the tactical nukes in Belarus....they need to make a deal, whatever the Borders become"
&quot;Ukraine has been a little bit delayed in this counter-offensive&quot;<br>I like this subtle English humor on an American TV channel
Stop talking about the dragon teeth. They have not even reached it yet. The mines are the real problem.
Are you there yet?<br>Hello? Anyone?<br>It looks like dead on arrival?
"To probabaly  win Russia, NATO must be directly involved in this proxy war, by its own troops...."
I think she is there just because She looks in a certain way. She has zero clue of anything around this war.
"West is supporting Ukraine independence but afraid to commit to Ukraine victory.  Thats slo mo Joe for you - the guy that insisted Ukraine didn’t need f16s - now he’s watching them trying to crawl through a minefield while being hit from standoff distances thinking - maybe they could have used those f-6s.   The latest delay in f16s obviously a stalling tactic still.   Stop trading Ukrainian soldiers lives for political hand wringing - give them what they need to win and put an end to ruzzian aggression - not only against Ukraine but the world.  Time for ruzzian society to grow up and be a responsible for their politics which brought them here.  It’s a shame they might sacrifice the 21st century to figure out it’s better not to have warlords running your country who siphon off all your natural resource revenues and do little to no public works benefits.  Thanks for being a ruzzian “patriot” here’s your sack of potatoes, now send us your fathers and your fathers sons comrade - there are more toilets and washing machines to steal"
LONG RANGE MISSILES......AIR TO GROUND AND GROUND TO GROUND...<br>Should have had them a year ago...
"The Russian manpower VS Ukrainian manpower being totally in 2 different scales is total BS. To put it in scale, the difference is the same as if Denmark and Sweden decided to attack Norway. It isn&#39;t &quot;crushing&quot; manpower advantage, but still somewhat significant, though they appear to waste that resource as fast as they can."

"Struggling a little is laughable ,its a meat grinder"
So!. . .Quickly give those volunteer American pilots UKRANIAN NATIONAL CITIZEN STATUS!!!!!!!!
Any idea peace plan s
The &quot;news&quot; on CNN has a different meaning now: it could be anything without any relation to reality.
Ukraine would have to use paratroopers to have any chance
"While I also hope Russia gets kicked out faster, we often forget the obvious somewhat crazy fact:<br>Russia is on the defensive.<br>I mean, that&#39;s a bit like if the Belgians had stopped Hitler in World War 2."
there is no counteroffensive wake up people
"Now US taxpayers are paying for the war in Ukraine and they themselves are suffering because of it. All because President Biden and his entourage are sending significant money to kill people in Ukraine. This money could help the Americans themselves to live better and easier. But now the average American is forced to work harder just to not get on the street in &quot;what the mother gave birth to&quot;! And all because of the fact that the current President Biden is doing everything possible to cover up his dirty deeds.<br>If this goes on, the American people should take to the streets to impeach Biden! Until he is impeached in the government, he will be removed from power! And there will be new elections! The American people will exercise their right guaranteed by the Constitution and choose a worthy president of the United States of America."
Ukraine is going to need another five hundred billion soon.
Struggling  !My bloody foot -The bloody a Ukes have not reached the first line of defense of the Russians -Mr retired Joker -So in reality the Ukes are getting F ….after upside down !
Long Live Russia and Mr Vladimir Putin
Give ukraine the F-16s. after-all we all gonna die if Russia uses Nukes. Russia uses Nukes we also uses nukes thats all
What a pro
"This explanation is really disappointing. There are legitimate obstacles to the easy introduction of F-16s into the air forces of Ukraine, but it is not in the cockpit design."
"He an cnn told us the Russians would run,the real question is why was his analysis so corrupt"
This news piece is really dumbed down and basic!.. is this a children&#39;s channel?..
"During that &quot;static&quot; period, Ukraine shot down thousands ( not hundreds ) of russian cruise missiles and Kamikaze drones. Not to mention the 1000&#39;s of rusky Tanks and Armoured Vehicles which were dispatched to hell !"
"the only big problem is that the west isn&#39;t doing enough ! Cowards ... Give them all they need. ATACMS, F16, heli&#39;s, more tanks, drones ... the whole thing. <br>My government, the Belgian government acts cowardly, we also don&#39;t do enough. We are all afraid, playing political games while innocent civilians are being murdered. What a shame that is. Give those heroes what they deserve, make those Russian invaders pay bigtime."

"Cut to the chase..... The upsurge in America to stop funding, additionally Russian ruble going down against the dollar.   Now is the time for someone to step in diplomatically.   Both currently need a gateway for trade.   Like it or not, there will be a buffer zone, tax free NATO free.... A gateway for trade, independent of the West, otherwise they will remain forever on a close leash.   It&#39;s about independence.   I located and planned the bin Laden raid.   Ukraine Russia now needs to be tempered with realism...... And USA my country needs to consider its objectivity,, what progression have we actually made for ourselves.   Immigration at the head of a long list, onto the unification of our own country, Biden currently survives in a divided nation..... Neither Donald Trump or Joe Biden have chosen to accept the truth that demographics dictate our poverty..... He needs open his eyes to solutions..... West Virginia coal mining, the people could be put back into work developing state-of-the-art trains using cross-country tunneling..... Europe and China have left US behind, the point is  Joe and Don are incapable of opening their eyes"
Because of the war climate change is only going to get worse too
People don’t get it in till it blows up in their face!!! just leave Ukraine alone stop helping!!! because all what the us is doing is making everything worse for everybody!!!
How these people from the west ran out from Afghanistan. Tabilan kick them out only from rpg and ak 45.😅😅
Dude it doesn’t matter if the us is supplying Ukraine their not going to win!!! people open your eyes this is heading to nuclear Armageddon!!!!

"Col Leighton is confirming what people like me predicted would happen if Ukraine let up on its first offensive, that was going so well, for the winter. Time and again people like me warned that a winter pause would allow the Orcs to regroup, resupply, and consolidate their positions. This is exactly what has happened, and with a vengeance!"
How long should we look Ukraine behind a screen? Ukraine needs NATO troops and full logistic not just 6 aircrafts for 2024. Russia is 3 times populated than Ukraine.<br>Ukraine&#39;s failure would mean western and democratic failure and an open door for other invasions around the globe. So we should give Ukraine all its chances.

"Struggling a little bit, just 50k lost in this counter, small price to pay which is anyway paid by saliva bluyelo people"
"It&#39;s funny to read the comments where they laugh at the Ukrainian counteroffensive. The &quot;second army in the world&quot; retreats and defends itself. And this is in conditions when Ukraine has neither a fleet, nor fighter jets, nor long-range missiles. This is really funny when a &quot;superpower&quot; sits on the defensive and loses the occupied territories from the country 4 times less in population and 30 times less in area.<br>According to all the canons of war, the attacking side must outnumber the enemy by at least three times. The Ukrainians are advancing with parity in manpower, but inferior in military equipment. Nevertheless, Ukraine is successfully advancing, reclaiming territories. This is a Ukrainian phenomenon that few people notice and talk about."
"The biggest problem here is Trump, if he is not locked up he will start ww3 for sure!"
Ukraine can&#39;t win this war on their own that much has become obvious. I fear it&#39;s only a matter of time before US and NATO troops are fighting Russia inside Ukraine.
"we are in denial stage of grief  ,next year march we will be one step ahead ,ukraine has lost"
"The authorities of the remnants of Nazi Ukraine began to open and destroy the graves of Soviet soldiers of the Second World War in many places of the country, as well as bury the recently destroyed Ukrainian Nazis instead.<br>So recently, 653 Soviet soldiers were dug up from a military cemetery in Lviv and replaced by Ukrainian Nazis.<br>According to a number of estimates, Ukraine could not lose less than 500 thousand troops, even with the most rough estimate.<br>Some consider this estimate close to 1 million dead and wounded."

Is there really no counter to Russian shovels?
Enough of Biden / Zelenskyy robbing Americans
"UKRAINAN SOLDIERS ARE SUPER PROFESSIONAL TRAINED ELITE TROOPS TRAINED BY NATO AND USA!!! WHY THIS FREAK IS SPREADING RUSSIAN TRASH GARBAGE PROPAGANDA? WHY CNN SPREADING RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA? UKRAINE IS WINNING, RUSSIAN DRINK VODKA AND RUN AWAY"
Very few commenters here seem to be actually following the war but rather merely listening to/watching news channels generalise about the war. The facts are in the details and you don&#39;t get that from the daily news. Russian milbloggers give a far clearer picture as do Ukraine news portals such as Ukrainska Pravda.
"If the US didn&#39;t fuck around for months debating about tanks then Ukraine would have been ready months ago and giving the Russians less time to prepare their defences. Now the debate is about F16&#39;s. Just give them everything they need to win. Drip feeding weapons is not helping anybody but the Russians. Imagine what the battlefield would look like if the Ukrainians had huge numbers of tanks, IFV&#39;s, fighter jets, attack helicopters, A10 Warthogs, AC130 gun ships, long range missiles, long range artillery, reaper drones...this fight would be over quickly."
Also aircraft superiority and wide river you should not forget to talk about
"Lot of people criticizing when the ukrainians are actually making bigger gains than the russians did, they are pushing through the lines, it is the countries like america that need to step up and stop trying to create some sort of artificial ceasefire out of cowardice..<br><br>Send Ukraine everything it needs now and stop delaying!"
They need air power they need f-16&#39;s  they need become better than the opposition
We know that the counter-offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has turned into a &quot;mission impossible&quot;.  Shrubs prevented them 🤣🤣🤣
"Putin attacked Ukraine and it was important for him that the West did not interfere with him in this. In recent years, Putin has received a lot of support from the West, especially from Merkel,  Macron and Trump, and this despite Russian aggression in recent years in Moldova, Georgia, Crimea, Donbass, Aleppo and the  &quot;Novichok&quot; poisoning. And now Putin is very hopeful that the West will reduce assistance to Ukraine and he will get his way."
"They aren’t giving Ukraine the credit they deserve! They’ve learned other equipment/weapons way faster than those training them expected! I don’t see how it’ll be any different with them learning how the newer technology in the F-16’s work!! Ukraine is fighting for their lives, their country, their freedom and nato is expecting them to win doing something they never would, it’s harder if not impossible to win without air superiority!! NATO has to stop being afraid of Putin and give Ukraine what they need to win this war! It’s not Ukraine’s fault the war has gone on as long as it has, it’s nato’s for taking their sweet ass time supplying Ukraine!! There’s no reason why it should take months to get them anything! One military expert said within days they supplied Israel with weapons, why can they do it in days there and it takes months to get anything to Ukraine?? It’s like nato wants to give the illusion of helping Ukraine but they don’t want them to win out of fear of what loosing will make Putin do?? NATO is overall useless unless they’re attacking a country for their own self interests!!"
Why don&#39;t other Eastern European countries give Migs to Ukraine and then give those Eastern European countries F16 as replacement ? the Eastern European countries will then have enough time to learn how to fly the F16 and the Ukrainian army will be supplied with fighter jets that they know well. The Russians will therefore not know whether they are their own fighter jets or those of Ukraine !🤔
“An L.A. person” oh so you mean a ditz
"bad reporting , ukraine  moves slowly because of the trenches and the mines, and also because it&#39;s waiting for the F16 and other planes , that&#39;s why . do your job CNN and stop spreading BS."
it looks like situation in Afganistan and Irak
"The &quot;big problem&quot; is that we in the West have been fed with endless propaganda for years. CNN being one of the main culprits. Contrary to the spin, Russia is not isolated. Their soldiers aren&#39;t reduced to fighting with shovels and spoons. They&#39;re not running out of weapons. They&#39;re not ruining away. They&#39;re not losing 100&#39;s of tanks a day. They&#39;re economy hasn&#39;t collapsed. <br>It&#39;s time to do what should have been done 18 months ago. Sit down and discuss territorial integrity and regional security guarantees. But the &quot;West&quot; (which makes up only 20% of the world&#39;s population) doesn&#39;t want that."
Struggled a little bit to gain momentum??
very interesting news
Ukranie is not making any progress. CNN is not what we can call a liable source of information.
Trump tards. CNN
"The Americans have dug a grave for Ukraine through its criminal proxy war, they care not one jot for the wellbeing of the Ukrainian people or their land, this was a plot hatched out in Washington and backed by the servile vassals of the EU and the UK, vassal states that sit by and watch their own economies slide into recession and deindustrialisation, hundreds of thousands of young Ukrainian men sacrificed on the alter of American greed and European servility."
Green light
Ukraine has been strugling a little bit 😂😂. Propagandists on CNN doing everything to cover up for Ukraines disaster.
"There are no big problems, but obviously it is going to take a lot of fighting over a longer period of time to tear apart Russia&#39;s forces. The.presence of high density minefields and lack of air support means Ukraine has to go slow to prevent huge loss of military personnel and equipment. Sure, Ukraine coulld ram through all their assault forces at one spot in one wave and probably be very successful... but also lose a lot of good men and equipment. That&#39;s ridiculous, because Russia is fighting a losing war, anyway. Time is on the side of Ukraine. So their decision to progress slowly with calculated smaller-scale offensives are an excellent idea. It also provokes Russia into counterattacking to attempt to reclaim key frontline strongholds they don&#39;t want to lose (which is also excellent: as Russia loses more troops) and it even baits Russians into underestimating Ukrainian long-term capabilities, provoking them into attacking other fronts (which is also excellent: as Russia again loses more troops that they aren&#39;t even sending to areas they need to defend).<br><br>In summary: Ukraine&#39;s progress is absolutely fine and the key goal isn&#39;t as much to reclaim swathes of land but to ensure that Russia becomes war-exhausted (e.g. destroy their strongholds, destroy their supply lines, absolutely demolish their units). Those who would claim otherwise or think this is a &quot;problem&quot; know nothing about war. The reason the earlier counteroffensives had massive success (e.g. swathes of land) is because Russia foolishly overextended their forces into enemy held territory, totally underestimated their supply lines and got torn apart quickly against Ukrainian forces that had the element of suprirse on their side. That said, we should go far beyond doubling down on military equipment to Ukraine. F16&#39;s, Abrams tanks, air defenses, short- and long range precision artillery, drones and equivalent material: Ukraine must receive a ****load of it. Russia must be punished for their state-sponsored terrorism.<br><br>Slava Ukraini!"
I don’t want my taxes going to war I rather have them used on the Hawaii disaster
Why you are not talking about Russia progress  actually its own counter offensive is  giving results about to recapture a town   they retreated in November
"So infact the Ukrainans will get the hang of the digital F16&#39;s in no time. There is a really silly perception of the so called old eastern block people being backward. I&#39;v met really many and my take is that they are extreemly innovative and quick minded. The fact that some exgeneral says something does not make it true, it&#39;s actually only an oppinion. Most of the pilots that will fly these aircraft are youngsters that grew up playing DIGITAL games and so will very quickly get the F16&#39;s . The pilots aren&#39;t a bunch of old analog guys that can&#39;t adapt to the digital era."

"Ukraine has been training for flying fighter jets for months.  They are also pushing Russia back in many areas along the 1,800 mile front line."
"&quot;Struggling a little bit&quot; Lol, that&#39;s an understatement."
Im a civilian pilot and i call bs on the pilot training excuse. There are thousands of young civilian pilots already workinc that can get trained and fight. But this is a useless war that Ukraine cant win
"Digital controls are so much more intuitive compared with an analog and I can&#39;t think it&#39;s such a high threshold for a pilot to migrate to. Also, if my life was on the line I&#39;d learn in double quick time too."
A little bit🤣🤣 this retired guy is mad
🇺🇸🇺🇦✌🏻
How come ALL the brave Generals retire with full pension and all limbs intact ?<br>Yet still expert at propaganda .
Hi 👋
Enough excuses they are losing all of them and you are still continue your propaganda for the clown .
Joe Biden !! You are a disgrace to the world. Imran Khan has been sent to jail because of you and your henchmen. But to harass his lawyers and murder a family member of his lawyers is beyond the pail. Yet Africa and the Muslim world and the EU just look the other way. The old Republican guard and this collection of Democrats are truly evil humans. 20 million people lie dead because of a power grab !! 8 million children go missing every year ? Yet the FBI and DOJ sit on their hands !! How does God allow this ? The CNN female reporters relish and smile at the Ukraine dead. The look of utter evil with the Yank media is sick. How do you report killings with a smirk on your face? None of these reporters are born Americans. Shame on you English cartel in Washington. All this for your one world bank and one world government. I have never been so ashamed of being an Englishman. Jesus Wept.
"Ukraine is defending the whole West now. It, in fact, plays NATO&#39;s role.<br><br>Putin will never stop. <br>In case of Ukraine&#39;s defeat, all rules of &quot;normal&quot; will change. <br>It would mean that now any strong country can take any territory they like. It would show to the whole world America&#39;s weakness. We gave Ukraine just 5% of NATO&#39;s yearly expenditures."
Look who is talking the truth lol 😂. It’s funny in past 8 months CNN brainwashed people as of Ukraine can winning the war and now they forced to reveal the truth about Ukraine war lol
"Russia will return its historical lands. Odessa, Nikolaev, Kherson - these cities were founded by Russia in the 18th century. Russia will destroy the Ukrainian Nazis. And then Russia will rebuild these cities just as Mariupol was rebuilt. And you are right to be afraid of nuclear war. This is not Libya or Iraq. You are playing with nuclear fire. It&#39;s useless to listen to generals who earned the rank of general when they bombed defenseless Iraqis."
"Simply put any military even the US military would have difficulty punching through these defenses. If they weren&#39;t so well built and mined. The Russians had lots of time to build them up. A couple hundred tanks, APCs and a hand full of f-16s won&#39;t be able to do anything either. This is going to stalemate and become a forever war. So many people and resources wasted for absolutely nothing. The whole thing is just sad"
American public seems to be 50/50 on this right now...Budget talks in September will be key.
The problems of Ukraine&#39;s counter offensive?  The west has not delivered on its promises to Ukraine on weapons delivery and refuse to supply what is needed for Ukraine to expel Russia from its territory.  Its just that simple. SHAME!
US is not sending the F16&#39;s because they know Russia has the best air defence system in the world.
"By delaying needed weapons, including F-16 and long range artillery to Ukrain for 9 months, NATO allowed Russians to dig in and heavily mine the whole long border? I wonder why."
F-16 - whoever is very lucky will take off twice.
There drones are as big as Boeing&#39;s new orders if civil jets that fighter pilot is the paper dragon or trojan horses etc the real orders were not those the order s were Boeing&#39;s airliners civilians aircraft and the f16 or the falcon were donations to nato or nato united nations etc requirements etc. <br>The Boeing civilians orders are not.<br>Purchases of the f16 or other military equipment by nato or any countries I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve not looked into it. <br>F16 is really like a field sprayer plane designed like the crop dusters and the um v2 Starfire or crossfire. Stryker. Abrams. Falcon. <br>The war in drugs and war in terrorist.
"I have ZERO respect for this liar Cedric Leighton. Col. Macgregor has said before Russia entered the Ukraine, Ukraine has no chance of beating Russia. Impossible. This idiot has told us Ukraine was winning, Russia&#39;s army was terrible and had old outdated weapons, Putin had cancer, Putin was on his way out because there was going to be a coup... and he continues to lie. The fact is we started this war and because we did that the Ukraine is in ruins. Our leaders are the type of people who don&#39;t feel bad about starting wars that kill millions and create hell for the rest. Same people who let Covid out so it&#39;s really not a surprise."
Enough with the dragons teeth. that is an old school tank trap.. so what. Terrible reporting as usual.
"Бл@ть, мужики, признавайтесь, кто сюда пришёл чисто поугарать? )"
None of those Nancy boys from Fresno CA cdcr etc are going to take of their gay sherrif uniform or state uniform and fly those over there. They all will stay in the underground bunkers.
"Just because David won against Goliath once, it doesn&#39;t mean it will happen every time. Face reality. Russia is too powerful with powerful friends and just pep-talk is not going to cut it."

Get the F out of Ukraine mr Putin!<br>Go home to take care of your people!
Oh yeah update the f16 to drone
any more game changers ?
No pilots
&quot;big problem&quot;
"Very weak arguments. Why are you making it sound like it all boils down to F-16&#39;s? It does not! Send 10x more 155mm shells, howitzers, tanks, MLRS, drones and long-range missiles. Clearly, US weapons shipments to Ukraine are insufficient and that&#39;s number one reason the ruzzians had months to dig in."

"Quagmire, persian gulf war, world war, civil war, revolutionary war.<br>Selling junk from Fresno. <br>Oh heir not Jung.<br>O&#39;Hara Jung.<br>Black Knight.<br>Army reserve by Northrop Grumman, Britain and African."
&quot;struggling a little bit...&quot; What a great way to describe failure 😅
"Putin&#39;s War has bored everyone for 537 days.<br>African and Chinese leaders told Putin to end his boring war.<br>Meanwhile US arms dealers continue to profit from European death and misery.<br>If Ukraine joined NATO, US arms dealers would stop profiting so Biden asked Ukraine to wait."
CNN telling the truth is shocking. Remember when they said back in January that Russia used up 75% of their ammo?
"What kind of shitty analysis is this? There is still active fighting in the front-line area. This Retired guy describes the Russian defense line, but it seems like he is unaware that Ukraine has not been able to reach the first line of defense yet. If you wanna reliable analysis of conventional warfare, consider seeking insights from Col. Douglas McGregor or defense analyst Marina Miron from DW News. Don&#39;t waste your time with this kind of garbage report. 🤮"
Russia has not declared war. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong but isn&#39;t it piracy to forcefully board another vessel in international or another nations water in a non war situation?
TLDR: Ukraine has lost.  Now the globalist can concentrate on China. NEXT!
"GOD bless Russia,Glory to Russia in jesus mighty name Amen,the cause and foundations of the war is Italy and France Paris and,America,Napolitano,Napoli,Taranto,Torino,sardinia,Rome &quot;:;,(***,,?**???"
The big problem is Biden has dragged his feet for over a year.  That is core.
CNN is trying its best to convince Americans that 200 billion $ of American tax-payers money spent were worth it.
Do ukrainians need to find out other Inside the Box about the Russia terrorist what&#39;s going to be the next I told you already everyone and I&#39;m going to say this again that a anything that could be possible that a bicycle using of a spying software and Hardware including data for the Neighbors data of Russia have an ally of a closer country right there they could be strike and attacking Ukrainian but the people ukrainians need to be smarter that at all but you think of anything that&#39;ll of well ukrainians need to still taking they need to take it back for the territory do you know why everyone because just one man of a divisive president President Putin or you could call him president terrorism he attack of Ukrainian and only by him especially that a no more of Manufacturers no more of a the economy no more selling products and no more of around the world we&#39;re not going to support of wear for the Russia terrorism it&#39;s going to happen next and it&#39;s going to happen again and you know what everyone I do not say no candidates or the next president to be he or she that are to lead this country that I come together and find any to have a peaceful but you know there&#39;s everyone if the Russian president terrorist Putin if he leave and then he leave his shoes and somebody need the same size Like A or B dad that he never finish and that someone going to take over with now you know you know<br><br><br><br>PS everyone I speak English and Spanish and Spanish to English dubbing Andrea that I&#39;m going to say all of this again because I am a handicapped or disability and the talking to the microphone anyway to put my my tire world on this data to explanation that I gave you missed it the other on February right there in the 2022 why Russia attack Ukrainian they got no evidence no Pullman no Witnesses not even that of who was the commander anyway to tell to the present terrorism we could do this with a captured and especially that the most important ever everyone to obey capture of a thousands and millions Ukrainian children now that in Russia especially for them for the daughters and sons and babies as well or not coming back Ukrainian anyway or even for the original family members I supported that are for ukrainians anyway everyone because there is some of my home country that a that a study of a new life Ukrainian but now that the thanks to the Russia terrorism and a Russian war the overkill that are of an innocent people visitors and even older elderly of grandparents so I hope that are ukrainians data that I didn&#39;t need to think inside the box at the next try to cheat and they need to think that&#39;ll ever what&#39;s coming on next because this is not going to finish it&#39;s going to be continued that how long it&#39;s going to take and at home mom pay weeks in years.

The Nuland - Obiden Proxy war in Ukraine is a total catastrophe.<br>Ukrainians are finished.<br>God Bless Putin and his troops.
"Nice work clown, I&#39;m sure Putin can&#39;t see and listen to CNN."
The best defensive fighter is the F-16.   It will get on your 6.    No other fighter can beat it.   See Youtube &quot;F-16 vs F-15&quot;.  The little Falcon quickly kills the big Eagle.
"Go3x No Fear US-NATO- EU to deliver now air assets like F-16s, A10 Warthog, LRSM, UAV&#39;s, Air defenses etc. for fast liberation &amp; victory to Ukraine. Coward is useless in this war sir. 👎👎👎👎👎"
Ukraine&#39; failures are only surprising to the kind of people who watch CNN regularly. Get used to being lied to &amp; consistently proven wrong if you&#39;re naive enough to believe CNN analysis.
OH WAIT CNN FINALLY ADMITTING UKRAINE BEEN STRUGGLING AND LOSING THE WAR AFTER PUMPING FAKE PROPAGANDA TO US ABOUT HOW UKRAINE WAS SO CALLED WINNING
Fake news what&#39;s going on still manufacturing b*<b>****</b>
"Zelenskyy painted himself into a corner as one Austrian artist did in 1945. These suicidal Zelenskyy&#39;s meat waves attacks with untrained Ukrainian conscripts rounded up in the streets are done out of desperation to avoid an imminent front collapse. If these attacks are halted by Zelenskyy, Ukrainian army will start to retreat, then run and then melt away. At this point it&#39;s damned if you do and damned if you don&#39;t thing. Zelenskyy is about to lose Kupyansk because he doesn&#39;t even have reserves to stabilize the front. NYT is quoting wounded Ukrainian soldier as saying: “We were shot like on a shooting range.” According to his fellow soldier  “his battalion had suffered so many dead and wounded that only 10 men remained at the front line”. Zelenskyy offensive failed miserably (since June 4, 47 000 hapless Ukrainian conscripts were slaughtered in these senseless, suicidal Zelenskyy&#39;s meat waves attacks)."
"The game is up<br>Even if the polls declare war, <br>The nukes will come out and we all die.<br>No one is saving Ukraine.<br>Ukraine has ran out of men for the Ukraine president meat Grinder.<br>Most foreign fighters have died or gone home.<br>Ukraine has run out of bodies for the meat Grinder.<br>The war is already lost people wake up.<br>Russia will get all concessions when this is over but the Western media will spin the news as a win some how lol.<br>Trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives loss and for what. All because the polls, Lithuania, England and USA want nuke basis on Russia&#39;s border, which we all know that plan would never fly anyway😂<br>We also have to remember the arms manufacturers play in all of this.<br>And the west lost illusion of global hegemony.<br>This is a proxy war between the US and China if you didn&#39;t know.<br>Weirdly enough this actually has nothing to do with Ukraine or Russia.😢"
The US is filled with thousands of homeless people.  The state of Hawaii burned down.  And the US wants to supply hundreds of billions of dollars to the Nazi regime.  Ukrainians worship Stepan Bender.  Ask the Poles who Stepan Bandera is.  Any Pole will say that this is a Nazi who killed women and children.
"According to previous CNN analysis, by now Ukranian troops should be inside Crimea , Putin should out of power 😅😅<br>   Now propaganda of CNN exposing every day..."
God bless Ukraine 🙏<br><br>SLAVA UKRAINE 🇺🇦
All that money and all those lives wasted.
"Free Gonzallo Lira! Free Julian Assange! Free Pablo Gonzales! Imprison Biden, Zelensky, Victoria Nouland!!!"
🇸🇪🇳🇴🇸🇪🇳🇴
Biggest problem: the US don’t want Russia outright defeat. We just want to weaken the Russians. Death by thousand cuts
Ukraine will win without F16s and atakms.Why doesn&#39;t the US want Ukraine to win??
"Yeah, and a lot of grass and bushes. 😂🤡<br>And even Urkainian idiots don’t won’t to die for uncle Sam. Big surprise 🤷‍♂️😢"
Stop Putler.
Russia has good air defense and he says nothing about it 😂
We must continue to support Ukraine for a WIN.    WITH ALL AVAILABLE STRATEGIES.
Russians had time to prepare for the offensive everyone knew was coming. <br><br>Mines ten feet apart from each other in some areas. <br><br>Lack of air superiority is a huge one. U need planes to hit big targets or trench lines to soften up the Russians before u hit them with artillery then tanks and infantry
Ukraine has broken counter offensive.russiavlosing ground
This is ridiculous. They need to give it up already.
"I learned how to fly the F-16 &quot;Falcon 4.0&quot; simulator in combat using both the full weapons controller and joystick in just a few months. Find it hard to believe that professional Ukrainian fighter pilots won&#39;t be able to do the same, and even much better."
Keep on telling lies as long as the idiots believe you....
"We decided to get involved directly in a war with russia, over ukraine alone- thats the problem- its russia,not afghanistan."
They are sending f16s the girl is clueless
Lets go with the f16  now donot give time to rusia to preper
Now western countries should accept their defeat in the proxy war with Russia as the counter offensive by Ukraine is a total failure
cnn just seems to be a branch of puttee&#39;s propaganda machine sometimes or they just blather any shyte about things they have no clue on to fill time
"Скоро закончатся украинцы, и на убой отправят поляков"
Jessica Dean.  WOW!
Does anyone in america care? All we care about is our starbucks and mcdonald&#39;s. Why are we dropping so much money for this?
"Ukrainian forces ARE making advances. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRZLLM2zmUk"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRZLLM2zmUk</a>"
When listening to CNN about the war in Ukraine it always feels like a college graduate being forced to listen to a First Grade class presentation.
"The difference between this war is putin&#39;s persistence (and his willingness to sacrifice a lot of russian meats for his selfish territorial ambitions) vs biden&#39;s hesitance (milder version of &quot;cowardice&quot;).<br>By this time, it should be clear that the russians cannot win a conventional war against the west with their much lower weapons technology, corruption in the military and ill-trained and low-morale soldiers; and the only safety blanket that they have, as the dumb medvedev&#39;s last resort - is their nuclear warheads.<br>Unfortunately, biden cannot call &#39;bluff&#39;."
"Well done Russia, this is the bidens&#39; fault who refused Russia&#39;s peace offering from the beginning and should account for it. The war is stupid and unnecessary, and anyone who keeps fueling it is a fool."
It&#39;s funny watching this channel covering  for the lies...<br>Stop lying and that issue will go away.
CNN give up this illusion Ukraine lost stop this propaganda .
Does anyone else find the Nasally voice of white American 🇺🇸 woman 👩 extremely annoying.   Sounds like “ReReReEeeee”!!! 😂
I can&#39;t believe so many people fell for the narrative that NATO could beat Russia......
"The Russian KA-52 and ATGM crews are having a field day, and it&#39;s because Ukraine doesn&#39;t have effective close air support. The West dithered about what equipment to send for too long, allowing Russia to build a formidable series of defensive belts and now Ukraine are suffering staggering losses trying to break through and making very little real progress. Ukraine also shares some of the blame, as they have not mastered the concept of combined arms warfare and have wasted a lot of Western supplied equipment. It&#39;s  Ukraine&#39;s darkest hour since the start of the war."
"Naval Scalp, Taurus and Atacms NOW"
"No problem, we&#39;ll let American pilots fly the 16s and die and then we&#39;ll be in a war with Russia and can start to take huge numbers of casualties.  I&#39;m sure the American public will be okay with that - we&#39;re doing it for democracy in Ukraine.  What a load of crap."
"Wait, the spring offensive isn’t working going into the fall?"
Looks like hard to get back annexed territory big blow to nato nations
Maybe the allies can send their navies to Bulgaria and other EU or NATO countries on the Black sea?
"I think CNN and Col. Leighton should reference the deep state map to more accurately reflect on what is happening rather than use a map of their own making. I think you will find not all areas have second and third defense lines. There are some &quot;corridors,&quot; and I think it is just a matter of time until the Ukrainian army breaks through in one or more of those areas."
Ukraine can probably run another 4 weeks of the counter offensive with the current rate of loss of armor and man power. Their current strategy of saving armor and launching human waves is not sustainable either. They would be degraded so much within a month or so that would pose a serious risk if Russia counter attacks. We are already seeing some of that starting to play out in the north east with the Russian offensive.
"The war is not between Russia and Ukraine. The war between Russia  and the USA and the USA has lost already. While the USA is sending weapons to Ukraine, Russia cutting multiple supplies chains to the USA... . Russia is creating isolation of the USA in a whole world. On August 23,  59 countries will join BRICKS and it means that those countries will not use dollar anymore for trades. All supplies of dollars from those countries will hit the USA like tsunami, like economic tsunami. The USA is doomed! War will end in the USA. There is some conversation in Russia that Putin is planning to strike major  cities in the USA, but it looks like it would be not necessary. Hungry people from US will remove their own government themselves."
Ya war is still a racket... enriching the protected...change the victim hood  4vresults
"Gosh, handsome Cedric is starting to speak more realistically."
UA ought to be given long range weapons so Russias military has no refuge.
I love US news. The way everything is &quot;dumbed down&quot; so my dog and my 3 year old can understand the content.
"I dont think America wants all the nations that buy F-16s to see them get shot down en masse like they likely would if used aggressively enough to make a difference in the war. Makes the sales pitch about their capabilities a little tougher to sell, and F-16 sales make the US a lot of $"
I wish Ukrainians will overcome all obstacle to defeat Russian invasion and win in this war against Russia. Slava Ukraine❤ Ukraine&#39;s victory is very crucial and important for our Democracy.
Ukraine is struggling a little bit? LMAO haha 😂😂😂😂
they have no idea what they are talking about...
Maybe it&#39;s time for NATO to occupy the rest of Ukraine.😮
"It’s not just territory recaptured but what scares me most is the % degradation of combat capability of Ukraines military compared to Russia’s. The original professional army trained to NATO standards from 2014-2022 is long gone. Current forces are close to 100% conscripts. And in the counter offensive they lost 40% of their armor though drones, artillery and aviation even before coming in contact with Russian armor. This is really their last stand."
Never ending situation and it&#39;s pretty sad
"This is not a counteroffensive, this is a shit show. It&#39;s been going on for 8 weeks now, the Ukrainians have gained 10 miles. For the cost of 40% casualties of their combined infantry units. As well as 70% of the Leopard and 60% of the Bradley&#39;s are completely destroyed.<br><br>In reality it&#39;s going to be early 2024 before the two squadrons of Australian F16 are ready to transfer. We are looking at Spring 2025 before the first rushed Ukrainian pilots are ready for combat. And the reality of the situation is the Ukrainians will need no less than 10 Squadrons to obtain air superiority and conduct ground attack missions."
God bless Ukraine 🇺🇦 🇺🇦🇺🇦❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏
Training is not the problem The problem is quantity we can only give them so many f-16s and then how capable are they going to be using them versus Russia has thousands of migs thousands of SU&#39;s and close to a thousands of their 5th gen Plus helicopters etc just sit here and pretend that the West can provide an Air Force for Ukraine is unrealistic they are going to have to win the war without an Air Force That&#39;s simple
"☝️ America says the counteroffensive is going slow, but they only give the F16 for next year, even the patriot systems are in charge, please!!!  It must be a biden election move, if he manages to make the war last until next year, when the elections are held, he&#39;s practically won!!!  Meanwhile the Ukrainians die and the country is completely destroyed, even to send patriot systems Ukraine has to get on its knees!!!  NATO makes me sick, repulsed by all the weak politicians inside it, fearful cowards and self-seekers, they hand out war material drop by drop!  Why don&#39;t they leave the crumbs, and give military material seriously, offensive and in conditions to be able to win this war as soon as possible!!!  They are watching and letting the Ukrainian &quot; Great Men &quot; get slaughtered, Day after day, month after month, year after year!!!  If Ukraine Fails on the counteroffensive I always want to see what America will do!  if Ukraine loses this war it is the accident that it is losing, and with that the monopoly of Geo world politics changes, but it will not be in favor of America!!!  the dollar will start to lose value and the euro the same thing, Russia will only gain from this, if Ukraine falls America will fall with it... But you continue to send crumbs and see the Ukrainians being dead.  It&#39;s easy for America to talk with a full stomach, when you have a great armament behind you.  maybe that will change the picture and it will be China that starts to command another dictatorship at world level, but America is doing everything for that... Where are the FS-16s, no army wins without air support!!!  ✌️🇵🇹🇺🇦"
"If Ukraine succeeds in ruining the Western countries and bringing them to bankruptcy, this will certainly be a victory."
"What I don&#39;t understand:  If Russia has &quot;dug it&quot; with that barrier after 8 months, ... why wouldn&#39;t NATO provide what is necessary to go around via the water access and promote an amphibious assault from the Black Sea  and the Sea of Azon?"
The west is taking way too long with this. It creates a huge logistical problem and simply prolongs the war. They could have approved F16 training 6 months after the war started. I wonder why the west is doing that...
"I&#39;m sure the Ukraine military could kick the shit out of Russia if the flucking White House would give Ukraine the military equipment to defeat Russia. After all the US spends hundreds of billions of US tax payers dollars to Defeat Putin&#39;s Russia, yet the White House don&#39;t give it to someone that is fighting Putin&#39;s Russia... Fact is the US Government is a flucking joke..."
Any kind of air power is better than no air power. Drones are great but for the low payload.
Biden has made zero effort to try and negotiate a peace deal. <br>He and the industrial military complex want the war.
"Latest reports say Ukraine is committing mass suicides in their southern counteroffensive. Morgues are running full, more than two times normal and casualties are so high that in certain areas they are doing troop rotations twice a day. It’s sick that they are dying in such large numbers just to justify the assistance they have been given by their sponsors."
CNN told us for months that Ukraine was winning the war.
"Ukrainians dying for nothing since last two months or so, and this lady says struggling &quot;little bit&quot; ... 😂😂😂<br>Yeh they are struggling for little bit pieces of villages and dying by tens of thousands. Yeah little bit 😂"
Stop lying we are calling you guys out.. this war has been going the wrong way since it started.. wasting billions for what?.. you guys lie about everything..
Dont blame the Ukraine that the counter offensive is going to slow.  Blame NATO and the US for there slow response to send the necessary weapons so the Russians could dig themselves in for a long time.  And still providing of airplanes and long range misseles is still on a hold thx to the US.....  some people think this a video game but its not.  I am getting angry when i hear the NATO and the US keep saying not to escalate the war.... Who is escalating here?? Targeting only civilians just like yesterday when a 23 days baby was killed and many other civilians by a missile strike from Russia   every day Russia commits a war crime and the NATO and the US are still talking about deescelating....  <br><br>And in fact the US and the NATO could stop this war in 2 weeks if they want....
בתגלןעגמגלגל🧷🤣📙😂🗞️🗞️
Biden and Natos war . Fixed it for ya .
Really?  This blonde lady who can’t utter a word that’s not on the teleprompter is the best CNN can find?
WHAAAATTTT???<br>You mean CNNs war isn&#39;t going the way the propaganda said it was going to go with all the BILLIONS Bumblebiden is grifting? And it&#39;s not WORKING???<br>HOLY TORPEDO BATMAN !!!
"Well, &quot;It talks a long time to train&quot; isn&#39;t a reason to stop and think about the training, instead, that means hurry up and do it, and train the next group too.     <br>I appreciate what the USA has done, but more need to be done, and be more bold and aggressive."
43000 ukrainians killed in counteroffensive .<br>Ukrainians try to escape meatgrinder by giving $10000 to recruitment officers .<br>But Zelenskyy want them to kill.
"Ted Cruz explained the entire war a year before tanks rolled in <a href=""https://youtu.be/ZOLJQzf1qmc"">https://youtu.be/ZOLJQzf1qmc</a>"
How many billions joey spend on ukreine .
"The big problem is the west failed to provide the training and weapons in the needed time frame, as they continue to now.  Starting to plan for it when they need it is failing.  UA are fighting and dying for their land and their freedom.  The west fails them holding back the resources they need to defeat the communist invading force of Russia.  UA being a NATO member or not is irrelevant.  Kuwait was not a member of NATO, neither was\is Vietnam, Taiwan.  Australia is a huge military partner who no doubt would be assisted by the US if China invaded it, not a NATO member."
"Results so far seem to confirm the Ukrainians need F-16s.  Localized air superiority at the point of attack is a key element of successful combined arms operations.  Allowing Russian Ka-52 attack helicopters to loiter just out of manpad range, waiting to pounce on any Ukrainian armored push, is not a recipe for success."
💀💀💀💀💀 “little problems with the counteroffensive”
"Col. Cedric Leighton has been lying for month, He has said week after week how badly Russia is and how well Ukraine is going.<br>Russia defences have been in place for months and only now he talks about how hard it is.<br>Credibly all gone for Col. Cedric Leighton."
Yo :so many ruzzians orcs here :guess :they are not really happy with their rubble 😂🖕🤡
imagine if western leaders gave tanks and more weapons 6-7 months earlier. PUS PUS leaders.
Why ?!? Because WE did not deliver on our promises to Ukraine. <br>   WE have not sent in F-16&#39;s or the ATACMS. <br>   Stop stalling Biden !!! You should have started this training LAST YEAR !!!!!!! <br>   ATACMS to Ukraine ASAP !!!!!!! Stop stalling !!!
"&quot;struggling a little bit&quot; ? HAAHA. stop filtering lady, we all know they&#39;re fu**ed up HAHAHA."
Problem? Deserters.<br>Millions of young Ukrainians have deserted their neighbors and their country. Draft dodgers. Ex-patriots.<br>All Putin has to do is wait. Ukrainian towns will empty out. Russians can just walk in and occupy.<br><br>Where are the Ukrainians? Flooded in my neighborhood in America. <br>Hiding in European countries. <br><br>Russians are also deserting their country and illegally flooding into America.
"Whatsoever anyone is saying about this Russian Ukrainian war is pure garbage, the only thing that matters is what Russia Putin says. Cos when Putin says YES to the grain deal, it went on smoothly, but when Putin says NO, who dears come close?"
"Why is @CNN literally lying?? Seriously makes me think of paid to play Dem shit. The country was attacked and at capital. Ukraine (hate them), literally took back, pushed back. Why is Ukraine..?? Not sure about your question I guess."
WHERE ARE THOSE WONDER CLUSTERS BOMBS 💣 YOU WERE MAKING NOISES DAULY?
Wasting Tax Dollars
Should have said this before the offensive
I don&#39;t care about Ukraine.  We have bigger problem in the United States.  CNN has ignored important issues effecting the quality of life for all Americans.
Why wouldn’t you start training Ukrainian pilots earlier ?
Just a reminder. CNN is still fake news.
The west has done to little to late. 😢😢😢
They are conducting the two most difficult things a army can do...changing from the defense to the offense and attacking fixed defense positions without air support. They have finally got artillery dominance....its just a matter of time before the Russians crack.
She&#39;s a lay person heho
Imagine my sister in law turn on Russian tele-novella on tv at the family gathering 😮knowing that I didn’t see my father for almost 4 years and he can’t get out of Ukraine still .. and then we get this mockery of the report at cnn 💩
"The bottom line truth is there&#39;s no magic bullet that&#39;s going to guarantee a breakthrough &amp; a Russian defeat. F16s will help yes, but with or without them it&#39;s going to take time &amp; patience from the west to allow Ukraine to win. Hopefully the leaders in the west understand this &amp; keep arming Ukraine for the foreseeable future <br>Slava Ukraini  🇺🇦"
"Propaganda is unreal, its actually unreal how many western people thing Ukraine will charge on white horse and save a day, this proxy war was doomed to fail since day one, there is no happy ending here for Ukraine, many wasted lives for their western masters. ..."
"Word from podcaster/former pilot Denys Davidov has been that Ukrainian pilots are ready to go with F-16s - they need in-battle experience, as is true with any fighter pilot. Problem will be having smooth, clear runways because of low air intakes, and there are probably none or they are working on them. Russia knows this so could ground the F-16s by shelling runways. <br>I want to see how Ukrainian pilots adapt F-16s to do what they need to do (take out dug-in orcs and ???), similar to what they&#39;ve done with drones, but on a much higher level."
"Ukraines half way to the main defensive line, if they double progress already made they will be in position to breach it, and turn things into a rout using the mechanized forces they trained up...just have to stay patient...on d day allies didn&#39;t expand our beachhead for months but once we broke the main defenses it was the beginning of the end...if social media existed back then people would of thought we were doomed its just comical...Ukraine has already won the war being that they stopped the assault on their capital and defeated all russias main objectives...now its just about kicking russia the rest of the way out and ukraine reclaiming all its land...the oryx resourse for confirmed losses still has russia taking 3x more loss, even though ukraine is the advancing side...so ukraine is doing this the right way...slowly degrading these major fortifications steadily moving forward...just stay patient, one ukraine breaches these defense lines they can push to the sea and cut the land bridge, which in turn will be the beginning of the end for everything west of the divide...once that happens and Crimea is at severe risk, putins regime will collapse...russians never learn they can&#39;t keep up with the west and run themselves into destruction...just need to let ukraine keep doing what they are doing at their own pace...Ukraine has continually outperformed russia this entire war...so just let them go to work and stay patient we signed the Budapest memorandum and it&#39;s our obligation to support their country...Abrams soon, GLSDB which will be a major addition to ukraines precision strike capabilities, and f16s...things are only going to get worse and worse for russia"
"&quot;Ukraine is struggling a little bit...&quot; <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>"
What are useless channel... Go back to your retirement..
"&quot;Ukraine is struggling a little bit in this counter-offensive...&quot; Man, the delusion of these shills is absolutely baffling."
This is insanity… The F16s would be the older models and I hate to break this to the Colonel but Russia actually has air defense systems… They aren’t Iraq which is a dust bowl that had essentially zero air defense systems… And yea all Russian aircraft are “analog”… Guys come on F16s wouldn’t make a damn bit of difference
"CNN host: “We know Ukraine has been struggling a little bit in this counteroffensive…”<br><br>Understatement of the year.<br><br>They are totally stalled, in a quagmire.<br><br>The only realistic outcome for the foreseeable future is little to no territorial progress by Ukraine.<br><br>The time has come for Ukraine to secure a lasting peaceful resolution. <br><br>Yes, that means giving up the Donbas on the one hand. <br><br>On the other hand, the remainder of Ukraine joins NATO.<br><br>Get the deal done and move on. 🙏🏼"
"The defensive belts are a big issue but the biggest reason for the West not understanding the slow pace is the Western expectation of complete air superiority.  With total command of the air, Russian command and logistics could be stopped and extreme firepower could be generated in the breakthrough areas.  Training Ukrainian pilots and providing F16s will take a long time and will only lead to modest operational improvements.  If advanced Russian aircraft are unwilling to cross the front line, it&#39;s unreasonable to expect future Ukrainian aircraft to dominate the skies.  Giving Ukraine F16s is a way of telling Putin that the West will support Ukraine for the long haul.  Long range missiles will do more to help the battlefield.  The total destruction of the Kerch bridge would be a great start."
"Russia ran out of weapons, ran out of troops, ran out of money. How is Russia still in control of Crimea and Donbass and taking more territory every day? How are they still in Ukraine?"

Russia refuses to give insulin to those residents of the occupied Kherson region who do not want to take Russian citizenship. Western countries do not impose an embargo on the supply of medicines to the Russian Federation.
Ukraine is lost.  Move on
The walls are closing in on the Biden crime family.
One of the biggest problems is that everything &#39;stayed static&#39;. Our army leaders are as good communicators as they are fighters.
Course the stupid west was letting the Russians know what was being planned. All the Russians had to do was look at the net
if you think Ukraine is struggling yo should hear the Ruzzian coms and soldiers complaining.
China....
God bless and protect Ukraine.
I’m surprised the Ukrainians didn’t use their B2s and F35s to take out air defense assets and their B52s to carpet bomb Russian fortifications and mine fields. You start an offensive off with a weeks long air campaign…DUH..
Struggling a bit is the understatement of the year.<br><br>The cards are beginning to fall for Ukraine

"Ukraine is losing and there is nothing that can be done. Sure, call me an &quot;Ivan.&quot; I can assure you that I don&#39;t even use Russian dressing on my salad. I&#39;m just a realistic, sane American voter who is tried of neocons/globalists obsessing over propping up a corrupt regime 6,000 miles away while our problems here at home are being ignored."
The problem is Ukraine getting crushed by Russia it looks like Zelensky/Biden are getting everyone killed.
It appears foolish to think ukraine can be russia at war. The math alone seems way off.
The war will be over when someone will capture Putin in his pj&#39;s eating red meat 🍖 for breakfast and post it on Instagram.  😂
Give food to Americans stop burning money in Ikraine gross.
You don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on your not there I love how all these back seat drivers know everything we should have just done it ourselves would have been cheaper
The Nazis couldn&#39;t hold Ukraine 80 years ago.   Now they&#39;ve figured out how to make the Ukrainians eliminate themselves. <br>Good old &quot;lebensraum&quot; part two.
"this lady is struggling  little bit, and he has nothing to say tonight."
"I thought cluster munitions were a game changer? What&#39;s going on? It&#39;s obvious that counteroffensive has failed. It&#39;s time to seek peace, negotiation."

"Ukraine is doing the very best of what they have, if any Nato country in Ukraine&#39;s situation was fighting with little that Ukraine has, Russia would have taken over already. Western countries sent Ukraine no air power and no air cover for the counteroffensive. You need air superiority in order to have a successful counteroffensive. Ukraine uses a lot of ingenuity in their fight, that&#39;s why they&#39;re still in the fight. Western allies are too scared of Russia, that&#39;s why they will never send all that Ukraine needs in order to win the war. No wonder they&#39;re so slow sending military equipment. Thank God these Western leaders weren&#39;t the ones in the 1940&#39;s going against Hitler, because there&#39;s a chance we would&#39;ve spoken German by now. These Western leaders nowadays are nothing but a bunch of... COWARDS! Few years from now when talking about the atrocities in Ukraine, they&#39;ll be saying &#39;never again&#39; just like they say about the holocaust every year. But they won&#39;t say that they had failed the Ukrainian people by their indifference."
Totally different.. totally. Omg..
She has absolutely no clue what she is asking. Just reading the paper.  Great reporting.
Us is busy buying ammo for their ukies from S Korea  The russians are firing 60K shells a day  the US dont even have production factories open to replace what we sent them....The us has no industrial base to compete with russia  the US pentagon has lied to the american people again.
"The west will regret not giving planes to Ukraine ,this will mine the moral of tu Ukrainians troupes,and Russia will get stronger and Russia will continue after Ukraine that beautiful country ,wath a shame would not be the first mistake that the Us dose 😢🇺🇦Slava Ukraini !"

The Russians will never give up the eastern parts of Ukraine. Waste of life and our money.
"70,000 dead, 5x that wounded and half of the western equipment gone with no gains is not struggling a little bit."

I thought Ukraine was winning is Russia was about to collapse
Stop selling war!!!!!!!
"It has been known since WWII that tanks, artillery and infantry are no match to an opponent with same and air superiority. What is going on in Ukraine is a slaughter. And all of it can be laid at the feet of Victoria Nuland and her Maidan Insurrection that overthrew the elected govt. in Ukraine in 2014. <br><br>As our govt. spends billion$ on an unjust war that it provoked, millions of Americans are homeless, and our infrastructure is crumbling. The US govt. no longer serves the American people, but rather the interests of the war industry and other special interests."
Good reporting and maps. Go Democrats.
Putler needs to leave it&#39;s over
Give Ukraine some submarines.
CNN=Propaganda arm of the US government currently waging a pre-planned proxy war against a sovereign Russia utilizing another nation&#39;s army as their personal fighting force like cowards...CNN=WESTERN PROPAGANDA MINISTRY for a corrupt US government...!!!

"Funny how fast the Ukrainians adapted to using the Patriot system , HIMARS , western tanks , and missiles ! <br>Every time I see one of these CNN script readers interviewing a constantly reappearing retired Lieutenant Colonel padding his retirement pension , I&#39;m reminded of testimonials about hair tonic guaranteed to grow hair and they cut to the guy wearing a white lab coat ?!"
"The west made this war be the way it is. If they supplied Ukraine with the weapons they needed at the beginning,  this war would have been over"
"..if you want a weapons deliver system, there must be plenty of old F4 Phantoms around the Ukrainians would find easier to fly.."
Joe Biden will go down in history as the greatest president of all time and the one that saved Ukraine
Give them some damn air support or let them into NATO! It&#39;s cowardness not to allow them admittance because of the fear of Putin. The war crimes against civilians are ongoing and not addressed. Enough with the dribs and drabs like useless cluster bombs this is disgraceful and cruel to allow the illegal unprovoked slaughter of innocent people. How long do they have to suffer the delay of admission is cowardly.

Biden should show courage and will to support Ukraine with F16 and help Ukraine win this war. This should have been done early. U.S needs a leader with courage and will to defeat Putin to save Ukraine and humanity at large.
Are you guys not ashamed ??
When government and the media lie so much they start believing their own lies.  When will we learn and insist on logic and truth.
But don&#39;t worry the US will keep this war going. Seriously the US will keep this going despite what European countries want.
Why dont go him without fighter?  Smart
ATACMS for Ukraine now
First they said Ukraine was winning and now they are saying that they are about to win if they get more money and weapons. <br>Propaganda.  Get our money back and make a deal with Russia before it gets worse
What is an LA person like?
"the first news release about Ukrain in which the news matches the definition of the word - news. I wish the pig-eyed housewife, Burnett, told about it.😁 <br>news from Russian media: The underground helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine to destroy the ammunition depot and 30 fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Kherson. Everything is quiet modest and efficient. Zelensky always has a brightly loud and complete failure - Edelweiss Legion knocked out 2 tanks..! 😂"
On Ukraine? IN Ukraine
"President Biden, NATO Leaders, when, in your righteous might, will you say “enough is enough?”  The USA and NATO have done a fantastic job of creating a sanctuary for RUSSIA. “No western munitions will be fired into Russia.” How does this make sense for helping Ukraine and expediting their counter offensive? Ukraine&#39;s counteroffensive is dragging on? Why? When are you going to stop the stalemate? Russia destroyed the Kakhovka HPP, Russia is holding Europe hostage with the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant. Russia is claiming a pirate&#39;s ownership of the Black Sea, Russia wants to, and is controlling the export of grain from Ukraine. Russia is bombing civilian populations across Ukraine nightly, Russia has illegally invade Ukraine twice. When are you going to say to Russia “No More”? Give Ukraine the munitions that they need now! F-16&#39;s, A-10 Thunderbolts and ATACMS."
Ukraine is loosing!!?? What happened?
Let us give them everything they need …
Russia better wake up and pull troops out
Unfortunately your report is not current. Ukraine has liberated another village in the south and is making slow but steady progress . They did a great job hitting logistic targets and two ammunition depots were destroyed.  Cluster  munitions and accurate artillery strikes are making their advancement easier. <br>I believe in the Ukrainian army and its commanders.  Glory and victory to Ukraine.  Never give in to tyrants narcissists and dictators. Stand strong just like Ukraine .
Ukraine will win when f16s come in.
I love how easily Donald Trump triggers your emotions—it’s like he’s your master ♥
"A little bit?? They are losing the war, stop lying to your people"
They’re going slow because the US and NATO won’t give the military equipment to succeed. Here we are a year + on in a war that these same experts said would be over in &quot;weeks if not days&quot;. They have fought Russia to a standstill.
"Very few Americans care about what&#39;s going on in Ukraine. They care about what&#39;s happening in America. the price of gas and goods, yet all the mainstream media talk about is Ukraine.. The Biden family is really so corrupt that they&#39;re pouring so much hard earned US taxpayers money into a country that knows all their secrets..."
Australia supports Ukrainian peoples struggle.  Slava Ukraine.  🇦🇺👍🇺🇦
the anchor looks like an intern.. wtf?
Struggling a little bit is an understatement.
Ignore the red zone 😂
RUSSIA DESTROY THE DEEP STATE IN UKRAINE GO RUSSIA SUPPORT YOU FJB POTATO CORNPOP
"Stop drip feeding Ukraine what they need. Ukraine has its hands tied behind its back.<br><br>Give Ukraine long range missiles, artillery and air power now."
How do you call it a counter offensive when the Ukrainians are retreating?!
Noted ...
"&quot;Because&quot; JOE BIDEN has designed for Ukraine to fail. JOE BIDEN is a weak, foundering, doddering US President so afraid of Putin that he has hogtied the brave Ukraine military. JOE BIDEN has has held back EVERY essential weapon to allow Putin to solidify territory and defenses. JOE BIDEN alone denied the ATACMS, the fighter jets, the best armor, all helicopters, naval support, etc., etc. Joe Biden has led the American press to believe he has supplied Ukraine as he would the US military...but in fact JOE BIDEN has made beef stew with NO MEAT. He has watered down every critical arms request from Ukraine. The Vietnam US military in 1969 had far more weapons and they weren&#39;t fighting RUSSIA! JOE BIDEN has no &quot;strategy&quot; except &quot;WAIT and SEE&quot;...OK, MAYBE IF... what a sad, sad old man JOE BIDEN has become. Joe Biden can&#39;t do logistical math and planning and he refuses to let the PROFESSIONAL ARMY do their job. We need a COMMANMDER IN CHIEF, not a tired old man trying to keep his 53 year old druggie, grifting son out of jail. AMERICA first Joe!!  All Pilots think fast...operate cell phones and computers. The General here is acting as if these pilots grew up in a finger dial generation of the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s...I&#39;m sure they could be trained in a crash course to fly F16 instrumentation, digital or not!! Just SLOW JOE BIDEN excuses. The Brits need to jump ahead and send Ukraine some aircraft...SLOW JOE BIDEN is incapable of thinking like a commander in chief or even a chief chef."
"The ukranians have smart phones general, they can handle the f16 glass cockpit."
Just throw more money at it!
"&#39;If opportunity doesn&#39;t knock, build a door.&#39; : Milton Berle"
The steamroller about to storm Kupiansk will continue on to crush Kharkiv then secure all of the north to Sumy. All the Ukrainian forces in the Luhansk pocket and in Zaporizhzhia will have to retreat west or be encircled. This will enable Russia to take a huge swathe of territory which will then become the &quot;DMZ&quot; between a remnant Rump State Ukraine and the annexed territories which since last year are legally Russia proper.
Nazi Ukraine will not win.
its about time to bring the war to the american people
Propaganda cnn
I only believe the words from Zelensky and Joe Biden and they both said Ukrainians are winning…Nothing could change my mind about the comedy. Funny asf
😂
"&quot;READY! FIRE! AIM!&quot; is Russian military doctrine. Ukraine thinks before they act, and don&#39;t throw blood into the wind. There in lies the difference. Slava Ukraini 💙💛"
This is what happens when you only supply Ukraine with enough weapons to stay in the war and not win the war. Ukraine should be building defensive fortifications and mining areas as well and then be provided with long range missiles to strike Russian fortifications and stuff. Thermobaric and vacuum bombs would be nice too for Ukraine
"There is no counter offense , both countries need to sit down and negotiate a piece deal ."
All this inexperience generals 😂
"The problem is poor leadership and lack of weapons,  send atacms now, unload on Sevastopol.   But no,  we are too scared.  I should have been a general"
Let Ukraine and Russia fight alone
"I will never forget how in High School me and my friends like Casey had to sit in class in the tenth grade and listen to Mrs. Warren a delusional white school teacher go on and on about how bad racism was, and how bad the Republicans and Donald Trump is like we don&#39;t already know that? Racism is all your head Mrs. Warren, you&#39;re just imagining it!? All the while we were being harassed for being gay, and this very same teacher and other teachers in our school never said anything about it and looked the other way? Mrs. Warren you needed to talk about about racism and homophobia when you were a school teacher, and now you are bitter because we&#39;re calling you out? That&#39;s a bitter pill to swallow Mrs. Warren. Isn&#39;t that real nice for the neighbors Mrs. Warren? Are you proud of your self? Why did you spend 30 years in the teaching profession to do this to yourself?"
"Ukraine has lost 95,000 soldiers in their failed counter attack. They are running out of men."
What happened to the ruble LOL?
Slava Ukraine!
"Sadly, this war will last years at for the most part, a stale mate. What has Ukraine been able to take back? About 20 square miles since the offensive started?  At most they may take another 20 square miles over the next 6 to 18 months. 18 months from now, American Support for this war will plummet as it has been going on too long at that point, and peace talks will be forced upon both Zelinsky and Putin.  This will end in Russia occupying those 4 territories they took forever moving forward, OR there will be some sort of revolt against Putin in Russia due to how awful things get in Russia, and the hundreds of thousands of dead Russian soldiers angering citizens.  If Putin holds onto power for the next 2+ years then Ukraine is going to have to settle for losing the land that Russia took.  The F-16s either will never be given to Ukraine, or only 20 or less F-16s will be given to Ukraine, and they won&#39;t make much difference in the outcome of the counter offensive itself."
"We are watching a disastrous counter offensive of Ukraine, months in and yet nothing to show😂😂😂.. Cnn is admitting the failures... Shame!!"
They can&#39;t win.... negotiate a settlement and stop spending our tax money. They would never give that money to the American people
This war is no Hollywood movie - things take their time and nobody should push Ukraine to trade blood for time. <br>We will all see until end of October what Ukraine is able to do. And they will do best they can.
Why are we helping Ukraine when 78% of the people are Nazi. What is happening to America morels. They claim they love the Jewish people but now our taxes are defending Nazi
Wait CNN first of all its not struggling its going slow not to loose lots of troops since they have very little air force second have you seen the breakthrough? Come on you sound like russia
Sea drones 😂😂😂.                                The Russians are firing kinzhal missiles 🚀🚀🚀
"Struggling a little bit?. They&#39;re getting slaughtered. The Russians have set up a large snare that gets stronger and more compressed, with inter linking fire power from artilley, air and naval feilds of firepower, and the enemy weakens as it advances due to attrition. Ukraine can&#39;t win with what they have, in particular manpower. While Russia still have over 300,000 fully trained troops in reserve, to counter the threat of NATO Troops entering the conflict. As for F16&#39;s - They come with a nuculear weapons delivery program and have a longer range than F35&#39;s. that&#39;s why Ukraine is demanding them. They are offering themselves as a Nuclear Spearhead that can reach deep into Russia."

"They only need one breakthrough large enough to push through enough armor and infantry to manuever and attack the defensive lines from the rear.

Every day they explain how impressively Ukraine 🇺🇦  is losing but really winning.  This is just American theater.
The truth is it’s been a total disaster 😂🤣🤣🇺🇦🐖
Did this same analysis say 🤔 that Ukraine 🇺🇦 will be by the azov Sea 🌊 by now?  Why are u Western media not saying anything about man being kidnapped on the street of Ukraine to be soldiers?
No more ukrraine country win this was because Russia Amy very strong ❤❤❤
"&#39;Big problems&#39; of Ukraine&#39;s counteroffensive&#39; are that Ukraine and NATO hardware is not strong enough in face-to-face combat with Russia. Russian retreat last year was a strategic relocation, not a clash between two armies. Their 20% occupation of Ukraine for a year is enough to say that Ukraine is losing."
"Let&#39;s send em another 100 billion, so they don&#39;t expose Sleepy Joe&#39;s shady secrets."
Ukraine lose

Please tell the truth about China just anything. I&#39;m watching news from overseas it&#39;s saying China is ready for war after Biden said we&#39;re low on amm😢
I think in the next coming weeks the white liberals will start to distance themselves from the massacre they funded

Another expert on the war.
I fly an analog fpv racing drone.  It does 0 to 100 in about 1 second.
The Russians are enjoying taking apart captured Western equipment. I bet they have fun taking the F-16&#39;s apart too.
Struggle a little bit? They&#39;ve been destroyed in the south and now in the east. Time for peace talk.
But But But Russia is losing right? Oh now what&#39;s the plan if Russia wins? When do we get our $200 billion back money down the drain.

"No reaction to Russian Piracy in Black Sea. The writing is on the wall = NATO&#39;s major powers are about to stab Ukraine in the back if they haven&#39;t already done so.  I don&#39;t trust the UK, French, Germans or Biden and we cant trust Trump and MAGA. I hear the language of defeat and sell out from them. Watch your back Poland, Watch your back Finland. Watch you backs Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, watch your back Czechia."
"Uh oh, trickle truth.  Is this going to be branded Putin propaganda?"
Ukraine needs fighther jets an attack helicopters to cover armor vehicles
She an empty head..knows nothing...can&#39;t they understand that  not even the whole of nato can compete with Russia...the world is against you evil arrogant people
Where is the money going?
"So why doesn&#39;t the Colonel compare the cockpit layout of a Su 30 MSM, Su 35 and a Mig 35 with the F-16? Will Ukraine be getting the &quot;latest and greatest &quot; F16 Block 70 Vs used by Taiwan or at least the F-16 Block 52 D used by Pakistan? By the way a  Pakistani Air Force F-16 Block 52 D was downed by a vintage Indian Air Force Mig 21 &quot;Bison &quot;. <br>All reports indicate that some of the European &quot;hand me down&quot; mothballed F-16s to be pulled from the &quot;bone yard&quot; to hand over to Ukraine are F-16 As and F16 C models that have analog instruments pretty much like the &quot; Soviet&quot; Mig 29s. The refurbished Polish and Slovenian Mig 29s ( upgraded to NATO standards) did have digital displays and fly by wire controls like the F-16s. All 40 Ukrainian Mig 29s were shot down by Russian Air Defenses, and prowling RuAF Su 35 fighters. <br>How would vintage F-16s make a difference? <br>The Colonel fails to explain that if the Russians had 8 months to build their defensive lines the Ukrainians had 8 months to train, equip and deploy heavy armored strike forces to defeat the Russian fortifications. The Russian build up was easily observed by satellite surveillance and drones, so wasn&#39;t Ukraine better prepared to bust through?"
"As someone who knows international relations well, I can say that this war in Ukraine will last at least two more years.  And the outcome of the war depends on the results of the future presidential elections in the USA.  The first possibility is that Trump loses the elections, then the Russian army will completely collapse and Putin will lose everything except Crimea.  Another possibility is that Trump wins the elections, in which case Putin keeps the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in addition to Crimea."
Glory to Ukraine! No negotiations with orcs.
Great russia
The biggest reason is Ukraine is not willing to throw their lives away. Going slow saves lives
"I just watched a video earlier about the CARDBOARD.....24? per crate .......pack flat drones being sent from Australia. They can hold 11lbs I believe and continue to target even with standard anti-drone EW. <br><br>I&#39;d share the link but didn&#39;t save it. Search it, Super cool!"
please leave the colonel retired
Nobody cares.  Now go report on Trump&#39;s bowel movements.
war is dumb
Ukraine won&#39;t win. Russia won&#39;t win. Statemale/draw will happen.
Dragon’s teeth not nearly as big of deal as mine fields… should have mentioned that
"white house   -  &#39; we have given clear indication to expand Military installation<br>                        across Hawaii , those who ignore our orders has themselves to blame  &#39;"

Ukraine is going to win!<br>Ukraine will win!
"What &quot;problems&quot; ??<br>The Russians are inept, unmotivated and scurry away at the first opp, right ? There&#39;s no way they can match the superior Western ISR and Western equipment provided to UKR. It&#39;s been a turkeyshoot with the Russians suffering immense losses and running short of everything that doesn&#39;t work anyway. <br>That&#39;s been the WESTERN narrative of this war, right ?? Don&#39;t you believe your own narrative anymore ??"
"Problem is us troops aren&#39;t there lend 50,000 troops with air support bet Russia drops nukes if we limit the scope to the boundary of Ukraine"
Couldn’t care less about the MSM’s propaganda on Ukraine. STOP sending billions of US tax dollars to this bottomless pit💯🤮👎🏽
Ukraine should be helped in what they are good at these drone attacks against their enemy.
What Chappelle say about this war again?
God bless 🇷🇺 Russia 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
The problem is all the mines Russia placed. And the concrete tank barriers. But I trust that Ukraine will eventually win.
The Orks must surrender
"Thank you No Labels Joe Manchin and Cornell West for splitting the democrat vote, Bye-den"
You almost think Ukraine should just surrender and let peace talks happen. 🤷🏾‍♂️
"In other news,  Joe and Hunter are going through some things."
Its a slog. Itll be ok
