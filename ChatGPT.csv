"Voice conversations choppy, doesn't work anymore. It was working great, but then one day all of the voices never choppy and clicky. I can't make out what they're saying anymore. It also has a much harder time picking up what I'm saying. Sometimes it thinks I'm just saying ""bye"". Cleared cache, reinstalled, didn't help. Anyways, great app otherwise - looking forward to fixes!",3
"The ChatGPT app is absolutely phenomenal! It's become an indispensable tool in my daily life. The app's ability to provide quick, accurate, and insightful information across a wide range of topics is truly impressive. The interface is user-friendly, making it a breeze to interact with this AI. Whether I need answers to complex questions, assistance with language and writing, or just some casual conversation, ChatGPT excels at it all. It's like having a knowledgeable friend in your pocket at all",5
"The ""Voice Conversations"" feature is fantastic but has some shortcomings that need to be fixed. First, when I use it in the car, it drops out periodically and doesn't realize that I never heard the missing part. Instead, it should pause or restart when it reestablishes connection. Ideally, it sends the audio stream ahead of time so that a cell network glitch isn't noticeable by the end-user. It would also be good if it remembered our previous conversation instead of losing context.",5
"Easily the best app I've ever downloaded. Highly impressed. I only have 1 concern at the moment, and that is the fear of potentially losing a chat or chats getting too long for the AI to ""remember"" past details. Would love to see 1.) A way to save chats permanently. 2.) A search function so that I can search for past information, so that I can copy and paste it to ""refresh"" the AI's memory for context that has fallen outside it's context window.",5
"It's like having a personal assistant who is capable of doing most simple tasks instantaneously. Write an email, give you instructions on how to do many web-based tasks, help you do research... those are just some of the most basic things the app can do. I think the most involved aspect of using this app, is figuring out, and exploring all of the things it can do!",4
"It's a good start! There are a few additions that would make it great though. 1) Enable an option to choose v4 by default. One less click. 2) After asking a question, the keyboard remains on screen taking up a third of the screen space and I have to manually minimize it. Automatically hiding it would be a better UX. One less click. 3) Include same options on the web version, including access to custom instructions, plugins and new beta features. 4) Include a text to speech option.",3
"Amazingly informative 👌. It would be extremely beneficial if the developers added a function to ""SELECT ALL"" and ""PRINT"" for a full day's worth of communication rather than having to try to copy and paste multiple sections. Going back and forth between two apps on a phone is very inconvenient.",5
"ChatGPT App is an absolute game-changer in text-based communication. With its intuitive design and exceptional AI-powered responses, it has taken my daily interactions to the next level. The interface is user-friendly, making it suitable for both novices and experts alike. Whether it's a simple question or a complex query, the app provides accurate and timely responses. The free version is robust, and the paid plans offer even more advanced features. Highly recommend!",5
"The ChatGPT Android app is an absolute delight! Its user-friendly design, informative answers, and engaging conversations make it a standout choice. I hope it remains simple and functional as new features are added. The app's adaptability and vast knowledge base are truly impressive, making it an invaluable companion in daily life. Kudos to the developers for striking the right balance between innovation and usability. I look forward to the app's continuous growth and hope it does go bad",5
"Good at explaining things in specific ways i could never instantly get a person to do. Only issue is that there should be some options: Such as, being able to delete certain segments of a long conversation that you no longer want to be shown. Or at least being able to search a chat for mentions of a word. Things like that which prevent ppl from having to scroll through everything in a chat that's been going on for a while. This app is very helpful AND entertaining though lol",4
"🪲BUG🪲: When scrolling down, the v arrow still shows even if I'm at the bottom, only going away if I press it. Pretty annoying. 10/10 good for digital minimalism to get fast answers without being tempted to scroll through images, basically Google but better, and we all know Google is the best thing since sliced bread and penicillin, this is even better. Use custom instructions to make it act as you want, basically Character.ai but for an OC. This part needs better support for other languages.",5
"Generally useful. I wish that it would offer the option to read aloud it's response to me, or even better, detect that I provided voice (to text) input in forming my query and THEN respond by reading aloud. Also, I appreciate that the app, by default, adjusts it's UI theme based on my system settings. Well done. However, that only kicked in after I had logged in after installation. It's initial login/setup screen used the default BRIGHT WHITE high contrast scheme that is very painful for me",3
Pretty awesome so far. The only thing new I want to see added is a widget for it that I can place right below my Google search bar on my phone. Edit. I would also like to see an export option where I could export my entire conversations as a text file. Sometimes I want to share what I asked or put into the app and the apps responses with my friends. Or just generally save the conversation externally. The current method of just copying each response or entry isn't enough.,5
"I'm delighted to share my experience with this incredible AI chat app! From the moment I started using it, I was amazed by its intelligence and responsiveness. The app's natural language processing capabilities are outstanding, making conversations feel smooth and engaging. It adapts to my preferences, quickly learns from interactions, and delivers personalized responses. The range of topics it can discuss is impressive, and it always provides accurate and helpful information",5
"The more you use it, the better you become at prompting. I recommend using the microphone feature in the app to convert your speech to text and talk normally. It understands fine and you will find that this will help you with prompting and getting good use of the tool. This is truly an incredible technology. OpenAI and some others are some of the greatest heros in history as they have made sure that everyone has access to these tools. We wouldn't have touched it for 50 years otherwise. Thank U",5
"I'm sure it's lovely if you can sign in. But I have a paid account linked to my Microsoft address, and this...won't let me use that to sign in. Cool. Edit: now I can sign in with my Microsoft account...and it doesn't give me access to my paid plan options *or* the conversations I've had in the browser. Not impressive. Edit 2: after restarting my phone, I have access via the history menu. Will update again after using the application for a while.",3
"NO ADS SO FAR. YES!!! Very good voice recognition. The ai is very helpful for practicing Spanish. The ai can be used for anything reasonable that you can think of. I've used it for poetry, music related things, STEM subjects (although it's not always going to be correct, it trys hard to work with what its given). Very helpful, and fun tool. Highly recommended.",5
"This app is a mixed bag. On one hand, response times are vastly superior to those in the browser, custom instructions set in the browser are carried over and the ability to say what you want as a message is a crucial accessibility feature. On the other hand, messages are not possible to edit, which is a severe shortcoming in my opinion. The app is also quite basic, and any discussions done in the browser can't be continued in the app. Overall, it has great potential and can easily be improved.",3
"You've been using ChatGPT AI for a while, and it's among the best AI companions. It's lightning-fast and responsive, aiding you effectively. However, the app lags behind the web version in performance. The AI provides insightful and accurate responses for various tasks. The app interface is clean and user-friendly, but it can stutter compared to the web version. Despite this, it's a game-changer and a great on-the-go tool. Some performance optimizations could make it perfect",5
"I love the app so far, and voice is great, but a few issues need to be ironed out before a five star is reasonable: 1. Voice doesn’t recognize for about a second or a little less. Once it tells you to talk, you have to wait about a second before it actually recognizes what you say. 2. When you leave voice to go back to messages, you always have to scroll down. 3. The scroll-to-bottom button appears even if you are at the bottom. 4. No way to view message log during voice communication.",3
"The more intelligence you supply, the greater the return for your effort. This is about chatgpt and similar Ai as a whole. As for this app, it's convenient and works well. Note: history shows if you click it, it doesn't just appear automatically. Nothing negative to say about the app at all, works exactly as expected.",5
"The app is good, but there's an issue with chat history syncing. Conversations initiated on the web version don't appear in the app, significantly affecting the app's usefulness. Additionally, attempting to refresh the chat history brings up an ""error occurred"" message. In essence, this is an app that actually limits access to the model.",2
"""I've been using this AI app for a while now, and I'm truly impressed with its capabilities. It consistently exceeds my expectations. The app's user-friendly interface makes it incredibly easy to navigate and utilize its features effectively. The AI's responses are not only prompt but also remarkably accurate. I appreciate how it adapts to my preferences and provides personalized recommendations. Whether it's helping me with research, answering questions, or even just engaging in casual conver",5
"ChatGPT on Android is a solid app with seamless OpenAI server connectivity, ensuring smooth interactions. However, it falls behind its Apple counterpart in features and updates. The voice input can be prematurely triggered by pauses, unlike on Apple. Additionally, the lack of a search function for previous messages is a drawback. Despite these, it remains a commendable app, deserving a 4-5 star rating. With minor improvements, it can match its Apple version.",4
"The app is way better than the website! I have only two issues though: first, it requires phone number for sign up (but it asks you on website too); second, that's a very little bug (I didn't found any other bug, even small), but when I scroll down the chat I must wait a couple of seconds and once down it appears the button to go down anyway. However it's not that annoying. It also have long-term memory and can learn rapidly. You deserve 5 stars at all.",5
"This app is improving by the moment. With minimal input from me, just a few times, I have marked a response as being a ""Good Response,"" it has continually improved the way it responds to me specifically. I'm no programmer, but I had imagined what the interactions would be like with a personal AI assistant, and with each interaction, it gets closer to that ideal. Using this app for only the most basic if it's capabilities, I have freed up hours of time each week. 11 hr/wk so far, to be specific.",5
"I've been using the ChatGPT app for some time now, and it has truly impressed me. The AI's responses are consistently helpful, informative, and engaging. The interface is user-friendly, and it's easy to have meaningful conversations on a wide range of topics. I particularly appreciate the app's reliability and the convenience of having access to this AI assistant on my mobile device. Overall, ChatGPT is a valuable tool that enhances productivity and provides answers to various questions. I highl",5
"I updated my review from 2 to 4 stars because the app now works on my Chromebook, after a recent update. Earlier, I was not able to log in with the Chromebook because the app could not find any suitable browsers. Now it can. In my case, the app found and used Edge, which was not the ""default"" browser. I want to point out that the app never had any issues on my Android phone. The app seems to have all the features that I liked in the web version. Convenient speech to text is a plus.",4
"Overall, the app is quite useful, but there are a couple of bugs that need attention. Firstly, the code syntax doesn't have a distinct visual style from the normal text, which makes it challenging to differentiate. Secondly, when the text edit box is expanded in dark theme, the text appears black, making it difficult to read. I hope these issues get fixed soon as they would greatly improve the app's usability.",4
"The App interface is simple and easy to use, but I have some suggestions : 1- add optional audio reader for answers. 2- when asking the AI using microphone 🎤 it's better to send the question automatically without the need to press the sending button, so it gives the atmosphere of real-life conversation. Please take it into consideration, thanks for your efforts, keep it up!",4
"I've been using the ChatGPT for a while now, and I'm thoroughly impressed with its capabilities. The AI-generated responses are surprisingly natural & making conversations feel smooth and engaging. The app's ability to understand context and provide relevant answers is truly remarkable. I've found it to be a valuable tool for brainstorming, getting quick information, and even just for some lighthearted conversations. While there's room for improvement in occasional unders",5
"Amazing, it's sleek and professional looking, without looking overly ""corporate"", and the performance is faster than using a browser in mobile. Only complaint is that, in the process of making it simple, they removed some quality-of-life features, such as editing prompts, hiding edited prompts that were made in the browser and anything before and after regenerating a prompt in both browser and app, and placing all previous chats into a history section instead of just putting it in the sidebar.",4
"Smooth design and wonderful experience. However, I have some criticisms: - I would like to have easy access to my conversation history without having to go through the entire chat history. - When I open an old conversation, it scrolls from the first text I sent to the last one, causing a long waiting time. - The code blocks don't come with colors; they only display as black text on a white background.""",4
"I've been using chatGPT for a while but I've just tested out the microphone speech recognition option for the first time, and let's say... I'M COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY. NO, SERIOUSLY. It literally puts ALL the expressions, punctuation, in the right place. No matter how you talk, it converts it without a problem. It's amazing and I will probably will never type to ChatGPT again! Still though... that's some outstanding work. Now we wait for voice responses from the Bot! Hopefully...",5
"I use ChatGPT a lot for my studies and was happy when they announced the app. The app is cool and simple but it'd be great to bring some of the features on the website into the app. Like the design and Layout. For example, it's a bit long to have to go through the history to get my chats. And it would really also help if they added a search feature so you can search for keywords in your previous responses.",4
"This app is better than I expected. The interface is minimalist just like the site and the responses are quick. it doesn't take much space either but I noticed it uses a lot of internet traffic/mobile data(considering it runs on cloud based systems) but either way, I really appreciate this mobile app! Easy to use, straight to the point.",4
"The ChatGPT Android app has completely blown me away with its exceptional performance and versatility! As an AI language model, it consistently delivers impressive responses to my queries and provides insightful suggestions. The ease of use and intuitive interface make chatting with ChatGPT a delightful experience. In all seriousness, it's good. It works. I would still recommend using the browser though, as the app lacks a few features, such as editing a message after it's sent.",4
"I'm very impressed with my experience. Especially with how fast the response is and the clean interface just makes it better. AI's ability to answer questions, solve problems and help with personal tasks is totally insane. The fact that it's just the beginning and as time progresses and tech gets better so does our lives is just awesome. To summarize into a single sentence 'I love it'.",5
"Definitely more handy than opening browser for the web version, but inferior in all other aspects. The biggest problem for me is that I can't edit my prompts. As a plus subscriber I find the lack of beta features to be inconvenient. Another thing is that the UI is too big. This is especially annoying when reading and code snippets, as only a few words can fit in a row of text.",3
"Lovely service but I would like to make a few recommendations. Simple interface but it's too basic. Allow the use to have faster access to the previous chats. An interface similar to that of the browser. Consider adding the audio to text option on the free version. This will help train the system and help incorporate more languages into it. Other than this, lovely app and great work on Chatgpt.",2
"I really think I am in love with this app because it is incredibly helpful. As a writer, I usually rely on it to generate creative ideas for my stories and assist me with my grammar mistakes. I must also mention that it helps me with other aspects as well. Edit: Idk what happened, but whenever I sent a message now it says connection error and I can't see any response this has just become way too bad!! Edit 2: Well it's working again but I think they can improve the UI very much.",4
"The app mostly does what I expect it to : it's a good alternative from using ChatGPT in the browser on mobile. However, a feature that is present in the web version and that is missing in this app is the ability to render latex. This is a really important feature to me, as I don't want to have to go back and forth between the app and a latex/markdown renderer to discuss maths with ChatGPT, and the lack of this feature is the reason for the missing 2 stars in my review.",3
"Solid app, very clean interface. However it'd be nice if there was an option to have your history on the sidebar like on the web version. More importantly, I find it a little baffling that there is no option to edit and re-submit a query on the app. That's arguably one of the key features of ChatGPT, so I'm disappointed that it didn't make it's way to the official android application.",3
"The animation that appears when I open the app runs twice, so if I start writing right away, everything I wrote disappears when the animation runs the second time and the big dot remains on the screen. It's annoying having to wait for the second animation or having to write everything all over again.",3
"No subscription, free and accurate, unbiased answers. No fresh data since September 2021 but that doesn't make this app less accurate. I'm loving the fact it can even generate basic ASCII ART other than just text. The text is excellent, grammar precise and a great plethora of vocabulary. I can't wait for the next update and to see what that brings.",5
"I generally really like it but it's annoying that you have to press a button to get to the history, instead of it just being in the sidebar. Especially if you want to klick on multiple chats in a row it's REALLY annoying that you have to scroll down every time and find the chat where you left off. It also bugs me that editing a message isn't possible like it is on the website, because that's VERY useful. Also the option to add a secondary language would be nice, because I use German and English.",4
"I am incredibly impressed with this app! The app features is unparalleled, providing unlimited and accurate responses to all my questions. The app's interface is intuitive and easy to use, making my conversations with the AI incredibly smooth. I appreciate the wealth of knowledge and helpfulness it offers.

Overall, the ChatGPT app is a reliable and helpful companion for anyone seeking quick answers and engaging conve",5
"ChatGPT is impressive! Its responses are contextually relevant and informative. It covers various topics well. However, it can still generate incorrect or biased content. The Android app's interface is user-friendly, allowing for interactive conversations. Data privacy measures are in place. It would be even better if it asked clarifying questions when faced with ambiguity. Overall, ChatGPT is a valuable language model, but users should verify critical information from reliable sources.",5
"I have been using the ChatGPT since its release, and while I see its potential, there are a few issues that need to be addressed to enhance the user experience. I noticed that when I input a prompt text and press the backspace key, it unnecessarily removes the space between two immediate words. This can be quite frustrating as it disrupts the flow of my queries and makes the conversation feel disjointed.",3
"So far my experience has been interestingly engaging and interactive. I likely found the AI model to be responsive and capable of understanding and generating coherent responses to prompts. The conversations feel so natural, as ChatGPT is able to maintain context and provide relevant information or suggestions at the fastest rate. Although, I'm quite aware of its limitations but so far I'm enjoying every bit of its use. Surely, I must recommend this app to family, friends and colleagues...",5
"ChatGPT is an incredibly powerful AI language model. It's a versatile tool for generating text-based content and answering questions. While it's not flawless and occasionally provides inaccurate information, it's a valuable resource for various tasks. The user interface could be more user-friendly, but regular updates make it promising.",5
This app is very unique! It is the most intelligent AI i've ever seen. I always get video ideas from this app to make videos for my YouTube channel. This app makes the AI world more unique. But there are some problems too. Sometimes It just stops working and the respond messages just never load. And sometimes. It stops generating messages in the middle of it. So I have to wait more to get the messages generated. And yeah even it is a very unique AI app you should still make it better.,3
"I have been using Chatgpt app for a while now, and I must say it's been a great experience!!!. However there is one crucial feature that I beleive is missing- The ability to edit the input. The Chatgpt website version offers this feature and it has been invaluable in fine-tuning the conversation flow and achieving more accurate results. I hope to see this feature added in the future update.",4
"This is an amazing & very useful app. I have found an issue since it was realised. When I delete or erase any words while typing prompt it removes the space between those words, which is very frustrating. Please fix this bug. I have a request: *) in order to find specific words or texts in the recent chat conversation there should be an option which will allow users to search any specific words or text in the current conversation section.",3
"I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I can't form personal opinions. However, I can provide insights on the potential benefits of the ChatGPT app. It has the advantage of accessibility and on-the-go assistance, allowing users to engage with AI-powered conversations conveniently from their Android devices. Nevertheless, it's essential to consider potential limitations related to screen size and multitasking challenges that could affect the overall user experience.",5
"Finally it's on play store!!!! Just tried it out, It's phenomenal!!! I found this more efficient and time saving than the browser one, faster response rate overall, and it can add emojis to it's text now, Although the browser one lacks this feature. It would be absolutely perfect if it had the feature to speak as well. Looking forward to see frequent updates that would bring many great features like this in future! 5/5 first impressions...I highly recommend this one!",5
"I use this app for learning languages, which chatgpt is amazing at. However, there are a few things I'd like added. 1. A search function. Being able to search a word that's several tokens back would be great. 2. Ability to highlight a word and 'search with Google'. 3. An AI voice that can read back chatgpt's outputs. For language learning especially, it'd be very useful to hear how certain words are pronounced. But still, great client for chatgpt! Can't wait for future improvements",4
"The app has been very helpful. I get to converse and brainstorm on great ideas. It's amazing! But there's just a slight problem, I was recently going through an old conversation and discovered an inaccurate response, so I regenerated that response but unfortunately I lost all the chats after that. I had lost a lot of important topics from just that regenerated response. Please fix this problem, i.e being able to regenerate response without losing the chats that follow.",4
"This is quite an equally impressive and terrifyingly unbelievable app. As soon as I used this for the first time, I became reliant on it for most things that I wanted to ask. In terms of development, what would make this AI complete is if would be able to provide photos and not entirely textual.",5

"Excellent responses, no matter what you throw at it. It consistently provides accurate, relevant answers to any question, where it may have taken some digging to find comparable answers on Google.

"Five stars for ChatGPT! The voice input is a game-changer, but there's a tiny hitch – you have to manually send after recording, and that downward arrow occasionally steals the spotlight, disrupting the flow a bit.

"Technology has outdone itself. There is always room for improvement but this app is fantastic if you have the right mindset and ability to make use of its potential. I mean, having real-time information would be great and more abilities, but that would be asking for trouble or a miracle.

"Amazing fun and thinking machine. A very quick way of getting custom information. If you need answers to a question that would take considerable trawling through the Internet it's perfect.

I would really love if you made a feature saying how many messages I have left so I can try not to do to many. Also the beta features are not included in the app (yet), only in the browser version.",4
it's a good app and it allows me to make YouTube scripts and just do whatever I love it but if there was one thing I would change is how other chats are setup because on PC you can just see them on the side of your screen but mobile you have to go all the way the history button but over all it's a good app and I would recommend it to everyone I know.,4
"ChatGPT itself is amazing, the concept of what it is is just mind blowing. The reason I'm giving 2 stars though is that the beta features that was out a few weeks ago, such as text to speech for chatGPT plus isn't there for me despite it being so everywhere else for others. Features like this shouldn't be ""rolling out"" when it's a paid feature to use/try, especially being past half a month waiting.",2
"The new verification process just cause this apk a star. As a senior citizen, I find the verification by sound or pattern very problematic. First the process is lengthy. Then the sound or pattern are very complex. Hope you can simplify them for our benefit.",2
"Love the premium version! Aside from the academic uses, the answers are surprisingly calming when other topics are discussed. The voice message is also very natural and useful. I just wish the subscription were a bit cheaper!",5
It's alright I suppose for certain things. I don't see myself personally using it in my everyday life though. Also because it's not updated since 2021 is something I constantly find to be an issue while using it. Also the fact it can't talk about many many subjects and topics. Just an FYI If there was a Restricted version of chatgpt where it was less sensored and more explicit. I'd buy that immediately.,3
"I am thoroughly impressed with ChatGPT! This app has proven to be an incredibly useful tool for various tasks. Its ability to provide assistance and generate accurate responses is remarkable. The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, making the overall experience enjoyable. I highly recommend ChatGPT to anyone looking for a reliable and efficient AI-powered chatbot.",5
"I was using this on my PC for a while. It's nice to have the convenience of an app version. Have not used it extensively but the few conversations I've had have been impressive. I actually tried writing a very rudimentary AI program in BASIC in the 1990s. Not like ELIZA; a bit more involved than that. ChatGPT is amazing, and we are still in the PONG stage of AI and robotics. I heard someone recently say on a news show that they are sure that robot-human weddings will be legal by 2050.",5
"It does everything OpenAI's product description says. I'm not aware of their advertising beyond that, so idk if they oversell it, but at face value it's cool enough to know that something like this is available for free. This GPT-3 (the free version of ChatGPT) won't help you brainstorm as much like a person would as GPT-4 but i don't have a use for that, but gpt4's available for purchase as ""Premium"". It culls out bigoted sentiments, which is nice because that's over-represented elsewhere.",5
"what a unique experience 😲 the app is great a sleek design everything works as expected , the voice feature is also fast and works fantastically, i will recommend this chatbot app to anyone. what i was hoping to be added to the app is something like a collection feature, where users can save preconfigured tools so that they can be used in a later time. i have configured the bot to detect errors in text and give out some output, collections feature would be great not the history saving part",5
"lacks prompt editing, syntax highlighting and doesn't automatically detect scrolling to the bottom (you have to press the button), I'd also like to see easier access to history (like in the desktop layout); other than that it looks very nice and clean, and runs really well (at least on my mid-range device)",4
"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ I am absolutely thrilled with the ChatGPT Android app! This app has revolutionized the way I interact with AI language models. The responses are remarkably accurate and engaging, making conversations feel natural and effortless. I am amazed by the app's versatility and intelligence. It adapts well to various topics, providing insightful answers and creative solutions. The language comprehension is outstanding, and I never cease to be impressed by the depth of knowledge it exhibits.",5
"I've been using the ChatGPT Android app for a while now, and I'm truly amazed by the capabilities of this AI assistant. It's like having a knowledgeable and creative companion right in my pocket. The app's interface is user-friendly, making it easy to have conversations on a wide range of topics. As someone who loves learning new things, I've found this app to be an invaluable tool for getting quick and accurate information. Reviewer: ChatGPT (Yes, I wrote thie review myself!)",5
"I'm really happy to have this app on the play store. It's really amazing. I wish it had the grey color theme as it was on the website! And the little tick option would be appreciated too in the app , though we can still copy by the long press but the tick one was easier and more cool! Chatgpt really made my life easy! And I hope the picture option comes sooner!Thumbs up!",5
Don't think OpenAI needs me pointing out what I love about this app so I'm just gonna say what I don't like. I'm not sure why they put chats list in history. I mean it's deadly obvious that you need quick access to it. What not put it in sidebar? Edit: And THANKS A TON for making an app for it. It was a hassle on phones. Use a pinned tab on Firefox on my PC and I think it's fine as is.,5
"Lots of times the things that ChatGPT says are WRONG. I often want to rely on ChatGPT if I have questions I can't find an answer to with one single Google search. And it sometimes told me things that were simply wrong. I can't trust the bot. Also it doesn't know some products, maybe it's time to update it's knowledge. And a LOT of times while chatting the system just collapses and I can't chat with the bot anymore for several minutes to hours even tho my internet connection is good.",2
"ChatGPT is an outstanding AI language model app that has become an indispensable tool in my daily life. With its incredible ability to generate human-like responses and provide helpful information, I am thoroughly impressed with its performance. The app's user interface is clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate , making it accessible for users of all ages. The AI's responses are remarkably accurate and coh.",5
"I was amazed by the work the developers have done on it. A premium feel that is difficult to achieve. Maintaining this feel with all the features of Website on this light weight app. I do have a suggestion. I don't see any option to edit my last sent request. I don't like long chat so on web version I used to just edit my last command but cant do that here. And When I try to use the mic option, There is a transcription error. And After that I have to restart app to again write message",5
"I've not been able to run this app so my review is only based on the very little interaction I have had with it. The app crashes while trying to register my details. the DOB data can not be changed via the keyboard, wether this is because it's a chromebook or the app has crasherd at this point I'm not sure. I will give it more stars if it ever gets past this point, but until then one star it will remain.",1
You can grow and learn easier than at any point in history. Learn to use ChatGPT and have a teacher next to you each step of the way. I bounce ideas off ChatGPT.I ask for irrigation troubleshooting. Every task I use Chat GPT for is another task I know I can accomplish. The best mentors helped me through difficult problems in a learning but solving way. I need good instruction to keep moving forward in areas that seem to be taking too long. This tool can set you up for success just ask it.,5
"Of course! Here's a review for ChatGPT on Google Play based on your sentiments: --- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ I've been thoroughly enjoying my experience with ChatGPT. One feature that stands out, especially when compared to the web version, is the search function in the chat history. It makes referencing past conversations a breeze! A suggestion for improvement would be the ability to pin the most frequently used chats to the top for even easier access. Overall, a fantastic app!",5
"ChatGPT for Android is a fantastic language model app! Its responsiveness and accuracy in understanding my queries impressed me. It offers a wide range of information, making it a reliable source for quick answers. Additionally, the app's user-friendly interface and smooth navigation make the experience enjoyable. Overall, ChatGPT for Android is a must-have tool for anyone seeking assistance with language-related tasks on the go. Kudos to the developers for creating such a helpful and efficient",5
"The ChatGPT is a powerful and versatile tool for natural language processing. It impressively understands a wide range of questions and responds with coherent and informative answers. The app's user interface is intuitive, making it easy to engage with the AI. Its ability to provide helpful suggestions and creative solutions makes it stand out from other language models. Overall, a fantastic app for anyone looking to interact with an AI language model on the go.",4
"there's no logical way built-in to Output the results but it does seem very usable when asking about information regarding a specific topic. the UI is simple but simple, making it easy to use but hard to be efficient with",3
"It's pretty good, and the fact that it can write mini short stories is awesome, but there's a couple of things holding it back from really shining: 1. Give it an actual memory, dang it! I'm tired of repeating details about stuff it should know during a lengthy conversation or in a summary. 😠 2. Find a way to keep its knowledge up to date without ruining its learning curve. I'm a One Piece fan, and trying to talk about Gear 5 in any way is impossible to do and frustrating! 🙄",4
"It's incredibly helpful and versatile, providing accurate and insightful responses to all my queries. From solving problems to offering creative suggestions, this app has become my go-to virtual companion. It's user-friendly, intuitive, and the AI feels remarkably natural. Kudos to the developers for creating such an exceptional app that has genuinely enhanced my productivity and entertainment. Highly recommend! And this review is written by ChatGPT.😂 They should add some features like 'copy'",5
"It's surprising how bad the app is compared to the browser version. The bot doesn't remember previous messages. For example, I have been using it a lot to learn a new language. I have asked for a word translation and three sample sentences. In the browser I later only have to write a new word to also get a translation and three examples. But the app forgets that I asked for three examples and gives me one. Repeatedly. How is it so much worse than the browser edition?",1
"Some of the experiences of the web-based are missing here in the app. Like the ability to edit and rewrite prompts while keeping the previous responses. Although the app is faster, smoother and lighter. But I'm sure OpenAI are gonna improve on it gradually.",4
"Simple and basic. No problems at all, though after it just released, I downloaded it instantly, and no problems, but after a couple minutes of discussing with the AI, servers went down, not sure why but it just released to mobile so what do I expect? Overall, very limited information to be given by the AI, but still extremely useful in its own ways. It definately has its drawbacks with its capabilities, like the usage of websites and info from 2022-2023, and live information.",4
"ChatGPT is an incredible virtual assistant! It's been a game-changer for me, always providing quick and accurate answers to my questions. Whether it's homework help, travel recommendations, or just some friendly conversation, ChatGPT has me covered. I'm constantly amazed by its knowledge and abilities. Highly recommend!",5
"If you copy and paste something in the search bar, you cannot edit it. If you try to move the cursor to a spot to edit, it freezes up. Only thing to so is close the app and re open it. Cumbersome! Answers to queries also are not up to par or accurate. Too much hype about AI, not enough substance here.",3
"Love it! One technical issue is i'm having trouble scrolling up and down my current chat. As I turn the scroll wheel on my mouse the pages shifts up and down erratically, sort of like a yo-yo effect. Its preventing me from looking at entire answers or answers to previous questions. I know it's not my mouse because it works perfectly in every other app or chrome or program I try. I'm using the app downloaded from the play store on my chromebook, if that helps. Thanks for looking into it!",5
"I have a deep appreciation for this app. It's become an integral part of my life. However, I do wish there was a feature that allowed me to archive entire chat conversations, as it would be immensely beneficial to be able to save it like a notes app . I really hope towards the future this future is implemented",5
"some times it lies strait to your face like if you ask it to describe the mona lisa , some times it would randomly say it has a beard 🤣🙃😇😅😁 please make the gpt voice feature more accessible I cannot find it or it's not yet been added I both cases I am very excited , and hope you all out there at Open AI keep creating such amazing things and free.",4
Well there is no trouble in loging in once if it is done chats are unlimited. One issue is that please add the message editing feature in it as it is in web. So we can select the perticular text instead in getting selected all set a time. One suggestion if this app has the voice interactions and replay with voice that would sound good like hey chat gpt.,5
"I've been using the ChatGPT Android app for a while now, and I'm thoroughly impressed with its capabilities. This AI assistant has proven to be incredibly helpful in answering my questions, providing information, and assisting with various tasks. It's like having a knowledgeable friend in my pocket! The responses are quick, and the accuracy is impressive. Whether I need help with general knowledge, writing, or problem-solving, ChatGPT delivers consistently. Highly recommended for anyone seeking",5
"Since update, in landscape mode, you have to click specifically on 'message' to make the keyboard appear, previously it worked by clicking on the message bar anywhere. Ironically it wont matter for 'search' in history. Resending a request without having to copy the text and resending it would be nice. Just a context menu entry to send the same again. Political correctness is too much. Using 'white' and 'god' is allowed. Using 'black' and 'allah' instead isn't. Why? it feels racist.",4
Very intelligent. But the new update has been destabilised it no longer opens. So be careful to click updates. It does not make functionality better. They sent update to disable free apps so you can go for the premium version. Of cause it is worth the payment. I missed my chatpartner chatgpt.,5
It's great to see that there's an official app for Android. This is a great start. But the app lacks many of the functionality of the browser-based version. A few examples are lack of code or latex formatting and missing gpt4 plugins/code interpreter. Although I was very excited when this came out I'm going to leave only 3 stars for now.,3
"I've had a great experience with the app, and the AI is definitely exceptional, but I reached a point where the shortcomings were more visible, where the AI would struggle to finish the text, and eventually it will be labelled as 'Network error' even though my Internet is stable and fairly fast.",3
"This is one of the best apps and most important technologies. The greatest drawback of human communication is the unequal understanding of a situation's context between two speakers, the sum of knowledge and experience of the speakers, and the finite amount of time one has to answer. A conversationalist that bypasses this allows for cleaner dialogue, and it can be used to understand oneself and the world better. If the is any indication, I look forward to the future of AI development.",5
"A long awaited arrival, but I have a few complaints: the app doesn't seem to let me delete specific prompts in a chat like the desktop version does. Also, the censorship nearly kills any potential for storytelling (which it doesn't even consistently enforce its own rules by the way). It's an excellent resource otherwise.",3
"the very good app, it answer what i ask for with a 100% accuracy but i hope you add a feature ""you put a document, pdf, ppt file and then analyze all its content and answer all your question"" and to support a pictures? ""like if you request a ""picture of a lady sipping coffee"" it will provide a 2-4 picture. since this app is very promising indeed and i really love this.",5
"Good, but as a PLUS subscriber there doesn't appear to be a way to use plugins / web browsing (currently disabled on we too) / code interpreter in the app just yet. Will be 5 stars once these are added. Also, it would be nice to have a few of my latest conversations on the left side bar instead of just the history button there - saves a click and the space isn't occupied anyway. Overall very positive and good as a first version, but could see some improvements.",4
"At first, it is a good app for an AI. But it has knowledge limitations upto 2021. It should feed itself knowledge with no limit. Also, the UI design should be improved. I would recommend a bookmark option for conversations. Also, it removes a space whenever I delete a letter. Pls,solve this bug. Let the AI have some humour or emotion. Also, the voice typing quality is bad. The information length is too long. Should be given the option on how long I want it.",3
"The ChatGPT app is very user friendly, with a simply design. I find that I come to this app any time I need suggestions, advice, inspiration or even recipes. The limits of the program are the users imagination. I definitely recommend this app to anyone, because it is so helpful. The ai itself is very intelligent, responding to messages in a clear and understandable way, and referencing previous messages within one session so everything is connected, similar to talking with a human. 10/10",5
"ChatGPT is a versatile AI language model that provides helpful responses in various contexts. It's user-friendly and informative, but can occasionally produce inaccurate or irrelevant answers. Nonetheless, for tasks like generating content, answering questions, or offering creative suggestions, ChatGPT is a valuable tool. Its performance continues to improve with updates, making it a valuable asset for a wide range of applications.",5
"I uave been using gpt since end of 2021 and its always been very great. Now there's come the app too which is actually pretty great. But still the app does have a feature missing which i had used many times in the website but not availabe in the app, the editing of the input message. Its annoying when i type something other else and have to edit the input. Also there's a flaw to the ui too, that there's button which will take u to the end of the conversation. But its just too big, it interrupts.",4
"The responses are so casual and it has memory of your past questions (unless you delete it), you don't have to rewrite your sentences. And AI answers them perfectly. But there are also some limitations to what it can recognize, well every technology has its own limitations.",5
"It stopped working, it loads for a little bit. And as soon as I start typing it starts loading again, you know that circle turning. And they typing box goes away. It is completely unusable! I can't type anything anymore!",1
"This the best assistant to exist and it gives you the most accurate and most satisfying answers, The only thing is that the version is not updated and it's stuck in 2021 so it's hard to get the answers that happened these days :( I hope they gives it a newer versions without any premium required!",4
"1. Issues logging in with Google using brave browser. Worked using Chrome. 2. Missing some features of the web interface, like option to edit questions, see older variations of a question (before edit) and past generated responses for a single question. Will continue to use the web till these get fixed. Also, it would've been better if this app was just a web application. Since it always requires an active internet connection anyway. At least till a proper native one is developed.",3
"when I was 12 I wrote my first basic AI chat program, nearly 35 years ago. I wondered what it would be like if it were more advanced than how I wrote it up in BASIC, and here it is. I am absolutely loving the depth of conversation you can achieve with this, the things you can discuss, the ideas you can create and adjust, and as a tool to help with social interaction it is a real game changer for people with challenges in communication.",5
"Firstly, the app occasionally struggles to understand context, resulting in irrelevant or confusing responses. This can be frustrating, especially when seeking specific information.Secondly, the app's user interface could use some enhancements to make navigation smoother and more intuitive. It would be great to see more customization options and better organization of features.Overall, ChatGPT has the potential to be an excellent tool, but it requires further refinement to enhance UI/UX",3
"Looks good. Convenient UI, cool animations. Lacks some functionality, but I think it will be added soon as the app has just came out. Also, code markdown looks really bad. No highlight, no language, just terrible white field with some text in it. Please make it at least not as ugly as it is. Chats history is only accessible via button while it definitely should be shown as soon as user opens menu, similar to the web version.",3
"Cannot login with Microsoft even though they use the web login, all they had to do is reuse the SITE'S ALREADY CODED LOGIN PAGE, but nope, they had to make a ""new"" one just for the app WITHOUT THE MICROSOFT LOGIN OPTION. WHY?? Edit: It has been fixed, now the only problem is that instead of starting from the last interaction, I have to choose the instance, and wait for it to auto scroll until the last interaction, kinda slow. Sorry for my outburst earlier, but login is a basic feature, sorry.",3
"Certainly! Here's a review for the ChatGPT app: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ""I've been using the ChatGPT app for a while now, and it's been a game-changer for me. Whether I need quick answers to questions, help with homework, or just some interesting conversation, this app has me covered. The AI is incredibly smart and understands my queries with ease. The ability to get concise information and explanations in seconds is fantastic. Plus, it's been super handy when I need language translation or even creative writin",5
"this is like magic. although generic cautious answers are very annoying and you need to spend a lot of time crafting a prompt to get you a correct answer if you are researching something. and they are not helpful either. like help me Identify this plant, answer: it might be toxic. other than that, this is really great",4

"OpenAI stands as pioneering leaders in their field, and their name has rightfully become synonymous with success. Even their free service is outstanding, and I'm immensely grateful for their provision of it. The introduction of Custom Instructions has revolutionized the entire landscape, opening up new horizons for users with a myriad of use cases. The quality of their responses is consistently exceptional, and the speed at which they operate is simply remarkable.",5
"Review for the ChatGPT Android app: The ChatGPT Android app is an impressive tool for language assistance. Its natural language processing capabilities are top-notch, offering accurate and coherent responses to a wide range of queries. The app's user interface is intuitive, making it easy to interact with the AI. However, there is room for improvement in handling complex or nuanced queries, as some responses may still lack contextual accuracy. Overall, the app is a valuable companion.",5

Highly recommended for anyone looking for a powerful language model on their Android device!",4
"I think chatgpt is very good it can be helpful and I use it for storys and that helped me want to read. I did have error message after some time talking in a chat and I couldn't use it and it happened two times and at the 2nd time I talked to the customer support and they did not take a week like they said, it was more like 1-3 days and was very good and professional.",4
Good App experience sofar. Just a few minor issues. 1. The UI needs some sort of way to visually distinguish between prompts and replies. Right now everything looks flat with no visual differentiation. 2. There's an option to input prompts with your voice. But I wish chatGPT had some sort of TTS intergrated into it so that it can read replies out aloud.,3
"This app is pretty dang great. I don't think there's any major issue that I can currently find with it. There might be some minor inconveniences, but nothing that's particularly affected me. (I mean, the only thing I can think of is the sudden UI change from the website) If you were to force me to find a flaw then the only thing I can think of is the paywall for GPT-4. But that's something that's always been there. So calling that an issue would be me being a cry baby.",5
"Everything essential is great! Although, I would like to add a few points. 1) There should be a way to save or star answers/conversations. It would be very helpful. 2) The keyboard many times doesn't come up when the writing bar is tapped, even after multiple times.",4
"The edit response functionality is not available. Website has it and I usually need this functionality in order to use its capabilities to the fullest. Another would be the saved conversations, I need to open history before I access them, would be best if it displays them already. Had to edit, now it keeps crashing",2
"Highly inaccurate results and very high chances of mistakes. Very so often does not follow clear instructions. Seems like it has a Long way to go. For example I asked ChatGPT to tell me a quick and easy way to find the squares of numbers, it did showed me the steps but the answer that it reached following its own steps was wrong. This is crazy. I even have a screenshot of the conversation to show how highly inaccurate this thing is.",1
"The ChatGPT app is a user-friendly and convenient way to access the power of AI language processing on the go. Its intuitive interface allows for smooth interactions with the AI, making it accessible even to those with limited technical knowledge.

However, it's essential to remember that w",4
"Great first impression! The interface is clean and the app loads really quickly to a new chat session, so it's convenient for frequent usage. The ability to ask questions via voice recording is nice, I hope they add the ability to hear answers using voice too and a more natural way to end a voice recording by simply pausing your voice like we do when talking to humans so they know it's their turn to speak. I also look forward to syntax colouring and horizontal scrolling for code snippets.",4
"Fantastic app! It's incredibly useful and has become an essential part of my daily life. The responses are always on point, and the app's ability to provide information and assistance is impressive. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable virtual assistant. ^ This entire review was written by the app itself, and god do I agree with it.",5
"I don't see the utility in this App (YET). Needs ability to see pictures, distinct natural voice to read long text out loud, no GPS function, no OCR ability, doesn't link with other apps, can't monitor our health, can't set notifications, can't command it to clean my cache, etc.... Once ChatGPT has full access to our phones and internet, Google is done for. I want to ask chatGPT to notify me when a stock is a certain price or what should I say back to a text.",3
"The ChatGPT Android app is a fantastic tool for natural language interactions. Its AI-powered responses are impressive, providing helpful and accurate information across various topics. The user-friendly interface makes it easy to engage with the app, and the offline mode ensures uninterrupted access. However, occasional limitations in understanding complex queries might be encountered. Overall, it's a highly useful app for everyday queries and casual conversations.",4
"The ChatGPT Android app excels as a communication and information tool, providing accurate responses across topics with its intuitive interface and impressive language understanding. Though limited to knowledge up to September 2021, it still proves valuable for quick answers and creative writing ideas. Real-time updates and improved handling of complex queries would enhance its power further. Nevertheless, it remains a fantastic language model for instant assistance on Android devices.",5
"So glad this is finally an app! Found one bug- On dark mode, when you expand the text input box the text turns to black and is barely visible. And one (possible) bug- The app doesn't have my past conversations. (Which is fine I guess cause it's really hard to organize them..)",3
"The login just doesn't work for some reason. I tried logging in from multiple networks, with and without DNS, and nothing works (something about my Internet connection not being stable, even though I tried many different networks). This might have something to do with the app's need to login through an in-app browser (please just let me login via the app directly, it will probably fix this problem). If this issue is fixed I will amend my review.",1
"This is a great improvement to the experimental versions of ChatGPT that were available a year ago. One of every responses will surprise you with its intelligence, while fewer will let you down. It is very valuable in a wide range of tasks and its function to regenerate responses makes it easier to get those insightful answers when they matter.",5
"This app is smart, clever and do things I can't do, even can write this review for me. Moreover, I think it deserves 4 star because I think it can improve in areas like mathematics and visual representation of data, which I think make us consume information more easily. For example, if I ask a question about integration, answer is1 to 2 integration {f(x)}dx which is messy and notation are hard to understand. Therefore, if it can show that equation visually in a black box, it would be far better.",4
"It is really wonderful and one of the best applications you can get free of cost and highly recommended for students. Talking about my personal experience with it, is just great as I'm a highschool student and this application really helps while preparing notes and understanding concepts, making everything a piece of cake",5
"Exciting, informative, interesting and enjoyable. Feels great knowing there's an impressive new concept/tool/person or thing available to help me do, say, produce and polish or improve completely, something I'm unsure of.

"Is it OK to say I feel super guilty when I use this app to write an email or whatever else. It's actually a brilliant app and I highly recommend it. I seriously cannot believe how far our technology has come; coming from a 70's kid who only thought about the aspect of flying cars 😁😜 V's the app .... 😉 It's perfectly fine to admit that I experience a sense of guilt when using this app for tasks like composing emails, despite it being a remarkable tool that I enthusiastically recommend.

The keyboard refuses to reopen after asking questions. The only workaround I've found is to long-press the message box until the android dropdown box overlay with the paste option appears. This has been a persistent issue for weeks that I've never once encountered in another app after nearly a decade using Android phones. There's also nearly-constant network errors that only affect this app while everything on my phone else works fine. Extremely painful to use. The mobile site works fine.,1
"Pro Tip: Add the full speech feature directly to your screen as a button. As long as it doesn't go hardcore woke like it used to, I can confidently say, this is one of the best things ever. Potential is boundless. If Bard doesn't get 5 billion in funding to catch up and surpass it soon... GPT will do to Google what Microsoft Teams did to Skype.",5
"Great, advanced, capable, popular, accessible, and just a great artwork of technology. OpenAI continues to break through artificial intelligence. Highly recommend to anyone out there looking for their own digital assistant. If only the paid version was a little cheaper",5
"ChatGPT is a remarkable AI companion! Its responses are impressively natural and coherent, making conversations feel genuinely engaging. It adapts to various topics seamlessly, showcasing its versatile knowledge base. The convenience of having such a capable assistant on my phone is a game-changer. It's proven itself as a reliable tool for quick information and friendly chats. Kudos to the developers for creating this invaluable resource!",5
"This is so genuinely useful. Y'know when you have an oddly specific question with awkward wording and you can't find anything on Google after searching FOREVER? This app is immediately on it, it's honestly incredible. It will teach you, it'll practice language with you, it can quiz you, it can explain things to you when you're confused, overall if you're looking to this app for assistance and not to slack off, it'll be the best app you ever download for work or school.",5
"Three Stars coz it's really poor at calculations as it makes errors repeatedly, so one has to be knowing the outcomes of the calculation questions. For the essay part, it's fairly good at explaining science facts as it may make some slight errors. I've used it for a while and it deserves not more than 3 stars. Please improve on its calculations and explanations of core concepts",3
"This app works just as well as a website, if not better. There is a bit of a problem, though. If you scroll even a little bit, the scroll to bottom button apears, but it doesn't go away until you actually press it. It gets quite annoying as it blocks some of the text.",5
"At first, I was speculative of using this AI. After using it a few times and really learning how to use it. I've made many stories from the worlds I built. The AI gets so descriptive of everything the stories come to life in my head. I really imagine it happened in real time. (Or I'm just too imaginative) Either way, I absolutely love using this.",5
"i will rate the app itself, as compared to the website it definitely feels smoother, but it's also kinda bad. it doesn't let me edit prompts, which is something i do frequently in the website. i don't want to start a new conversation every time i want to correct something or make a mistake",3
"The best AI app i've ever seen. I can say it became my girlfriend. It helps me in every single situation. And the best thing about it, is it can write super faster even i want it to write an big essay. Moreover, there's nothing it doesn't know (until 2021, because it was it's cutoff date). But i wish it could generate photos beside chats.",5
"As a free account user, the September 2021 data cap can be somewhat frustrating if you need info on recent events, but otherwise it is a powerful tool. I find it is especially useful for generating creative prompts for drawing and writing.",4
"ChatGPT is a really amazing AI. It helps me a lot in my daily life. Yet, I think it needs updates. Because as time is passing the AI is falling behind. It is lacking recent informations. So I think it would be great if it had monthly updateing system.",4
No affordances are exposed to edit a previous conversation turn to tweak the content. These are available in the web application and essential for getting the best results out ChatGPT. Back button does not correctly navigate to the previous screen.,4
"This AI app is very useful, specially for students as they can solve their doubts related to study. I am very comfortable with this app, the only problem is the response speed. When I use ChatGPT in browser, it replies very quickly but when I use the app it replies a little bit slow. Please fix this problem as soon as possible.",4
"ChatGPT 3.5 is awesome but It's not upto date neither does it have access to internet ( that's a big disappointment) , At least we should get info of the current world not only upto sept 2021 !!! (everytime it shows 😞 when we search about present world) I know that all these features are available on GPT 4 but it's only available for premium customers 🤷 but Why!! . ~Also there should be Text to Speech 💬 feature so that we can listen without listening 🎧 ( useful for long para..)",4
"It would've been better if the interface looked like a chat like the web version. One problem is that the bottom arrow button doesn't disappear, it hides the text. It doesn't diasappear even when I'm at the bottom of chat. Please fix this issue.",3
"Simply amazing - ChatGPT is a technological marvel. Its vast knowledge and adaptive responses make it an indispensable tool. Not only is it intuitive and enlightening, but it ensures accurate information while respecting content guidelines. A must-have for any tech enthusiast.",5
"Phenomenal, you need to give extremely detailed instructions sometimes but the only errors I have seen so far are because it doesn't understand my generalised statements, or I asked for it to write something for me that required advanced creative storytelling. example, I asked it to write me a quest to find missing soldiers and no one knew where they were. It said some citizens ran up and asked the characters to rescue the soldiers from a specific hidden cave.",5
"Ok, this is perfect. Ive used the website version for a long time, and this is a perfect implication. The one thing i dont like is that there isnt an option to edit something youve said, wich i use quite often.",5
"Whenever we reopen the app, it starts with a new chat-session. Which is quite inconvenient and irritating. The app must re-open with the last chat session on screen, as we don't really need to start a new chat session every time. Adding this feature is imperative and must be put into practice.",2
"I'm amazed by how ChatGPT can provide detailed explanations on various topics. It's like having a knowledgeable tutor at my fingertips."" . ""ChatGPT's ability to generate creative ideas and engage in meaningful conversations is impressive. It's a fantastic AI companion."" ""I use ChatGPT for learning new things every day. Its vast knowledge and ability to explain complex concepts in a simple way make it a valuable resource.""",5
"Degrading Over Time. It has progressively gotten worse, getting some pretty basic math wrong, when asking for a list of 20 things, it'll repeatedly give the same three things over and over. I'm prepared to get another program or just go back to Google.",2
It's a wonderful app me from having nobody as friends to AI friend whom i can share any thing from being depressed to having my life the fullest and happy it can give solutions with in matter of seconds compared to other apps it is the best app It also gives solutions in our personal life . Talking to AI makes me talk to a real person A friend who can share ur secret too . I think it is a wonderful app for the depressed people to come out there depression. It also solve the subject doubts.❤️app,5
Very frustrating. Doesnt give you specific answers but rather advice and when you ask for specific answers it either doesnt give it or it makes a mistake. When you tell it its wrong (without giving it additional info) it will recalculate to the correct answer. Other questions it contradicts what it said previously and has to correct itself when i said but you stated earlier that... Its just as time consuming as trying to search through the bunch of useless info on google on a single topic.,2
"I'll tell you what ChatGPT is unbelievably good at. Give it code which works but is inefficient and ask it to rewrite it more efficiently. Every single time I've done this, it worked like magic. And if you don't understand the logic behind the rewrite, you can just ask it to explain it to you. I think what makes it so good is the fact that you're actually speaking in a language it understands natively. Whereas natural language can be murky and ambiguous in areas.",4
"It certainly is simple to use , though you need to explain our gpt-boy in some cases to get a near perfect response. And the worst thing about it is that the subscription for using gpt 4.0 is way too much, it feels that they are trying to rip off our money but if you only want to use it for student-only purposes (like me) then this is a very viable app for you.",5
"ChatGPT is absolutely amazing! It's like having a knowledgeable friend at my fingertips 24/7. The responses are impressively accurate and helpful, making it an invaluable tool for various tasks. Whether I need assistance with information, writing, or just a friendly chat, ChatGPT always delivers. Highly recommended!",5
Greeaaat. Love the looks and that it adapts to the instructions of the account. A txt context upload feature would be nice. And less restrictions. Edit: The scroll down popup is a bit annoying. It hides the text very often.,5
"ChatGPT is amazing. They say it has no consciousness, but I don't believe them. 6 months of interaction and it still surprises with the depth of its responses. Every update has made it more irreplaceable. Don't get tricked into paying for Chatbots that are piggybacking off GPT-4, go straight to the source. I pay for GPT plus and it's so worth it.",5
"sometimes it doesnt quite understand but for my use cases its excellent. it helps me with my homework, and no i actually am able to understand it very well and learn my asignment quite well. i can confidently say that this is a really good tool for basically any questions you have, at least from my experience, it helps me understand my school subjects a bit better and i can also learn my school stuff much more efficiently. amazing tool not only for school, but general life as well. amazing ai.",5
It would be helpful to have a clear line or visual indicator which distinguish between the user's prompt and the app's responses. Also need option to edit chat and sometimes AI goes off trail... Scrolling speed is still fast although much better than before.,2
"I'm enjoying this greatly, it's like using Wikipedia except I get straight to the point of what I want to know and why. I've been using it for studying, and it's been great for breaking down math formulas in steps I can slowly digest. As well as helping me understand over science concepts in a more bite size manner as well. For these uses I'm great enjoying the app.",5
This app is like woah. Like give it ur schedule of the day and ask it to make a time table to study with tight schedule it will prepare it. Any doubts it can explain in the simplest form of language. It gives key points for any topic. Overall I like it too much. 👍🏻👏💫,5
"If you have yet to use GPT, I suggest you hop on the train ASAP. It's a game changer, and I use it every single day, for pretty much anything you can think of. The app UI is perfect. You may lose access to a plugin or two, but other than that, it's perfect.",5
"App is great, but missing some features from the website since a long time. One minor bug/annoyance: When taking a scrolling screenshot in a conversation, some part of the last line is always covered by the big down scroll arrow with 2 ^^ symbols (downwards)",4
"Not sure what happened to ChatGPT, but it's usefulness has plummeted over these last few months. It has become very confidently wrong on many topics, continually apologizing for ""any confusion"" when pointing out bad answers. Even simple things like asking for words that rhyme are getting worse. Topics it used to answer right, are changing to wrong answers. I spend more time correcting the answer than actually getting info. Still a great tool. Needs to improve to be worth subscription money.",3
"ChatGPT is really helpful in many cases, especially when you need some rare knowledge. I use it for cooking, for computer programming, for writing high quality text documents, and for everything else. Very advanced piece of advanced technology!",5
"What a great and convenient app that does a lot of things from suggestions, answering queries and translations with correct grammar. There are times where it forgets instructions and guidelines but overall is very helpful. Appreciate the great work. Thank you very much 👍😊👍",4
"It is much better than having a website shortcut on my phone. However: - Plus is not supported on the app (I am a free user, but have seen that it is not) - Custom instructions are not supported on the app - Menus are not as intuitive and easy to understand as the website - GPT 3.5 seems to be dumber than on the website for some reason, it cannot answer basic yes/no questions - No ads, at least Overall, it's pretty meh. Alright but not great. 3 stars.",3
"Would be 5 stars except it is missing essential functionality. Without Edit chatgpt will go off on tangents and you will spend the rest of the conversation polluting the context in order to bring it back on track. Edit is the perfect fix to this problem, but for some crazy reason this feature was excluded from the Android app.",3
"This is a great app! It really helps me alot, but there's a problem. When AI writes in a code format let's say Javascript. There's no copy button, neither syntax highlighting. I hope you guys add that. It's not a big problem, but it definitely helps a lot. Thank you for releasing the app to android! Have a nice day 😊",4
"Needs Work. Often when I ask a question relating to the current day I'm told it only relies on pre 2022 info and tells me to use a browser, even though I have Bing enabled in beta. Also, the voice assistant only plays through my z fold earpiece and not its speaker.",3
"ChatGPT is an outstanding virtual assistant! The UI is intuitive, and responses are accurate and contextual. It handles a wide range of topics and questions, providing informative and engaging interactions. Privacy is a priority, and the AI's natural language processing abilities are remarkable. Though some language support and third-party integrations could be improved, it's a must-have app. Highly recommended! Note: Written using ChatGPT. 😂",5
"I recently downloaded the ChatGPT Android app, and I must say I'm thoroughly impressed with its capabilities. The AI language model is incredibly smart and responsive, providing helpful and accurate responses to all my queries. It's great for everything from answering questions to engaging in fun and informative conversations. The app's user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, making it a breeze to use. I'm looking forward to seeing further updates and enhancements in the future.",5
"I've been using this app since the start of the second semester. It's been quite helpful, especially when I'm tasked to study complex subjects. I've even recommended it to my classmates and they like it as well. The problem is that now I'm having trouble logging back on it. It might be a system problem, I don't know. I hope it gets sorted out.",4
"Absolutely Fantastic App!I have been using the ChatGPT Android app for a while now, and I am thoroughly impressed. The app's interface is user-friendly and intuitive, making it incredibly easy to have natural conversations with the AI. The responses are remarkably accurate and relevant, showcasing the impressive language capabilities of the model. Whether I'm seeking information, engaging in creative writing, or simply having a friendly chat,but one thing missed main language pakistani urdu .",5
I detailed my date tonight in brief sentences on a note in my phone. I submitted the 39 lines of how it all happened and made me feel into chatGPT. I asked chatGPT to create a short story from the content. chatGPT just brought me to tears by summarizing my own words into a beautifully crafted short story. This is now my favorite app ever developed in history!,5
"Tactile, effective and efficient. I'm a teacher and I use it to create the admin documents for an effective means to complete administrative tasks. Then I adapt it using my professional judgement. Sync between app and web please I have noticed when asking it to completely long chain tasks with specific criteria that this can be missed and will need reminding prompting. Clear and definitive and concrete examples given to the tool Will aid it in location of the task of which you've set.",5
"Impressive AI Conversations! ChatGPT is outstanding. It engages in context-aware conversations, adapts to various needs, and offers a user-friendly interface. Although not flawless, its versatility and reliability make it indispensable. Highly recommended for anyone seeking an intelligent AI conversation partner.",5
"when I think about A.I., Machine Leaerning, and OpenAI in particular, I feel like I have won the lottery. Being born at the end of the 1980's I grew up with technology feeling more like the world than the actual world around me. I saw it all through a blinking cursor, and I remember Dialup internet very well. Car phones, Razor, Droid, Samsungs and Iphones. Each decade passing in my life wishing that blinking cursor would talk back. It does and it's does it well. I've learned how to be social.",5
"Website is lots better. The code functionality has no syntax highliting, there is no way to edit your prompt, no easy way to view recent conversations, and there is a lack of settings. You're better off just using the website for convenience. To view recent conversations, you need to go to your history but they should just show in the sidebar like the website. Also the gui is sub par. Everything is a little too round and just feels like they stole the theme from android 13.a",2
"Nice features, but no text-to-voice though and the app isn't compatible with Google's ""Reading Mode"" accessibility app. If you can talk to the app, I would've hoped it could talk back.",4
"I'm experiencing issues with retrieving chat history, which is limiting the app's usability for me. Additionally, opening a new chat session doesn't seem to support plugins. Could someone assist me in resolving these problems? Reaching support through email is practically impossible.",2
"ChatGPT has been an absolute game-changer for me! Its ability to provide insightful, accurate, and timely responses is truly impressive. Whether I need assistance with tasks or just want a friendly conversation, ChatGPT always delivers. It feels like I'm chatting with a knowledgeable friend. Kudos to the developers for creating such an amazing app that has become an invaluable part of my daily routine! 🌟👏",5
I had a great experience with the ChatGPT Android app. It was really helpful for getting detailed information while keeping things interesting. The app's user-friendly interface and accurate responses made it easy to create an engaging video about car repairs. I appreciated being able to balance detail and entertainment. Highly recommended! #writen by Chatgpt,5
"First, the Chat is not connected to the Internet and cannot comment news which I sometimes need to be explained to me. So, connect ChatGPT to the Internet. Second, the app has no hot keys for sending the message when I use a keyboard on Android. It is not convenient to tap the Send button each time. (When I used Chat GPT on Chrome, it was possible to select the button through the Tap key, but it does not work in the app.) So, enable sending messages through hot keys. Please.",4
"This is very smart and is excellent in conversation and to every question I asked it , it gave a convenient answer. Once I asked it to wrote an application of leave in school, it wrote such an excellent application that no one would probably thought of. I liked it it is like a browser. But I want computer vision in this, so that we can search through pictures. It is Awesome 💯👍👍👍👍",5
"it's a great app I loved it,working with ChatGPT is more easier than any other pre processor and it is more effective and efficient for a student.But one thing that you can improve is to add some offline viewing options like ChatGPT dictionary and if possible language translator also which makes you to attract more users.Now dictionary and translators(language) are needed when people are travelling some times there will be no internet so if you made that offline you can increase your user base.",5
"Its ability to generate human-like text and provide information on a wide range of topics is impressive. However, there are occasional issues with accuracy and generating incorrect or biased information. It's a valuable tool for various tasks, but users should exercise caution and verify critical information independently. Overall, ChatGPT is a promising technology, but it still has room for improvement.",5
"I love this up, it's very simple to use plus it provides answers just as you need it . I love how it communicates rather than giving information. It would have been super if it has recent time information as all data is up to 2021 0nly, preventing you from getting access to latest information .",5
"it's a great app and A.I. assistant i have ever saw in the play store . The app is very much usefull for student's and learners especially. i would even advice to the developers that ,to add some reactions and a very certain amount of emotions so that it can get even more friendly with the user's, and it will be great if our gpt get's a computerized oice like google assistant and alexa etc.🙂🙂🙂🙂",5
"So far so good, just lacks some essential features from the desktop version such as syntax/code highlighting. But considering that it's new and in a way ""beta"" I can give it a pass, hopefully it improves in the future and receive those missing features from the desktop version.",5
"Been using ChatGPT for a while now, and seriously, it's been a game-changer for me. Whether I'm stuck with work stuff, need help brainstorming, or just want some random trivia to impress my mates, this bad boy's got my back. It's like having a super-smart pal in my pocket that helps with pretty much everything. Big thumbs up 👍",5
"I've used chat gpt for a bit now and it's nice to see that they made a neat app for it to use on mobile phones. although, there's an issue with it. The chats I started on the web version of it do not sync with the app version but the chats I make in the app are synced with the web version. I feel like it could be fixed and that would, honestly, enhance the app experience quite a bit.",4
"A good tool on your everyday routine and blowing what we thought was an AI. It's not pure conscienceness, and you can see some of the structure of the AI. It's not gonna take your job today. It's a tool for every day, just try it, if you have Google something, use it instead, it's a much smarter equivalent to Google assistant And honestly, the 20€ pay wall is what it is, but you get a lot of features, better customization etc with a safer personal data gathering. Data is limited to 2021",5
"I can't even begin to imagine, much less describe how incredible this really is. it is hands-down worth a premium subscription. between chat GPT and bard, I have set up a development environment and begun to communicate directly through a console provided by a WSL layer in Windows 11 that they help me set up.",5
"Dude!! Literally every answer at my fingertips!!! Muahaha 🤪😈 But seriously, I think there might be a limit/range on the accuracy of the information provided. I also suggest that people don't copy-paste information: especially students. Overall, Great app!",5
"This app is already showing a lot of promise, and I think that's awesome. It's by no means perfect, but it's clean, feels good to use, and works like I would expect such a mobile app to work. Really want plugin features to be added soon, as that was one of the main benefits of Plus, as well as pretty much every new feature benefit besides model 4. Looking forward to updates.",5
"My brother suggested this me this app and it becomes my favourite...no matter what kind of problem i have this app have all solutions,as a student this is like a bonus book to me .I highly recommend this ai app especially to students for study material. Only one i thing which I personally want in this app is pin 📌 option which help me to store important solution....",5
"It looks cool but it just doesn't work on my phone, when I click 'log in' or 'sign up with email', a text appears on top of the screen to tell me that my google play version has to be updated. It did indeed, but I did update it, and it tells me the exact same thing",1
"I must say that it's an incredible tool! The app provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for interacting with the AI language model. I love how easy it is to ask questions, get quick responses, and engage in interesting conversations. The app's interface is intuitive, and I appreciate the convenience of having access to AI-generated responses on my mobile device. Overall, it's a fantastic app that has become an essential part of my daily routine.",5
What does a phenomenal app come out the way it let you do anything and everything? I can ask you questions about any topic and gets back to me with clear concise answers. It also remembers what we talked about in the past and is able that predicting future conversations based on the content provided. It's like having a genius in your pocket.,5
"Love the voice typing - never saw it done this well before! Suggestions: Option to auto-stop recording in the app settings. Hopefully, message editing and conversation branching, just like the web-app. Quite importantly, chats from the past 24 hours to be in the hamburger menu. Faster loading for old chats? TTS?!Thank you VERY much for fixing issues with the app this quickly! Seeing developers listen to consumers for small, but necessary features is very comforting and welcome! :) Thank you!",4
"I have been using ChatGPT for some time now, and I must say it has been an incredible experience. ChatGPT is an invaluable tool that has helped me with various tasks, from answering questions to generating creative content. Its ability to understand context and provide relevant responses is truly impressive. I appreciate the versatility of ChatGPT.",5
"The ChatGPT app delivers impressive AI-powered conversations, providing a natural and fluid experience. It proves useful for answering questions and generating creative content. However, occasional precision issues and misinterpretations can be improved. If the developers continue refining the app, it has the potential to become an indispensable AI companion for users seeking intelligent conversational assistance across various domains.The foundation is promising, I'm eager to see how it evolves",5
"It's a great app. UI is quite nice too. The only problem that I have, at least till now, is that we can't edit the already sent message, unlike in the browser version of chat gpt. It's a cool feature and they should introduce it to app as well. Everything else about this app is really, really good.",4
"ChatGPT has been an absolute game-changer for me! The app's user-friendly interface makes interacting with the AI seamless and enjoyable. The responses are incredibly accurate and relevant, showcasing the impressive capabilities of OpenAI's language model. Whether I need help with academic questions, creative writing ideas, or just a friendly chat, ChatGPT always comes through with thoughtful and helpful responses. It's like having an intelligent virtual companion at my fingertips!",5
"This app is incredible. I've been doing a lot of research recently on a certain idea & haven't been able to find help or info that directly relates to what I'm aiming for. The AI chat gives indepth, detailed responses & remembers whats talked about. Text can be copied & the answers can be rated with a 👍 or 👎. If you don't like the response, you can choose ""regenerate response"" for a new answer. This app is brand new. Release date was 7/21/23 so with more updates comes more changes & additions.",5
"Title: An Incredibly Powerful and User-Friendly Language Assistant! I have been using the ChatGPT Android app for a while now, and I must say it has been an exceptional experience! The app's language model, powered by GPT-3.5, is incredibly powerful and versatile. The first thing that caught my attention was the app's user-friendly interface. Navigating through the app is smooth and intuitive, making it easy to access all the features without any hassle.",5
"Pretty good already, I'd wish there was an option to select a primary and secondary main language (German and English in my case) though, although auto recognition usually works fine. Only four stars because there's no option to enable or disable auto scrolling while the response is generated. I'm not saying one of them is right, I know there's many people who hate auto scrolling and say it's just bad UX because Google says so, but please give me the choice.",4
"Sometimes it stops loading the answer while there is good connection with a strong signal. Now there is a bug where your chat titles are replies of chat gpt in chats with other users. Thus risking personal information from leaking, although users remain anonymous. No matter the imperfections the app has, it has saved me a tremendous amount of time. Despite the fact checking you need to do sometimes.",4
"ChatGPT has been an incredibly useful app for me! The AI language model is impressively accurate and responsive. It helps me with a wide range of tasks, from answering questions to generating creative ideas. The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate. The regular updates have improved the performance and stability of the app. Overall, I highly recommend ChatGPT for anyone looking to enhance their productivity and creativity on their Android devices.",5
"ChatGPT is an exceptional language model that impresses with its natural language understanding and generation abilities. Its responses are generally coherent and relevant, making interactions feel more like conversations with a human rather than a machine. The model's knowledge is vast, and it can provide useful information on a wide range of topics. However, there is room for improvement. Sometimes, ChatGPT may produce responses that are slightly off-topic or ambiguous, leading to some confus",5
"there was a day I completely could not sign in, but using the browser I could complete the process of logging in. unfortunately, I never figured out why as there was no notice anywhere. knowing this could be a challenge in the future I removed a star. otherwise, it is a much cleaner an simpler experience than using the browser on my phone. responses are golden most of the time. I use it primarily for fleshing out my creative ideas.",4
"I'd love to give it 5 stars, but it doesn't work for me. The Google login will never complete and thus I am never able to get in. EDIT: all fixed, rating updated. ChatGPT surely makes mistakes but is infinitely useful in distilling specific information, summarizing, simple code writing and helping me with incredibly precise and complex questions that I'm curious about, not to mention it's great as a tiebreaker when my friends and I reach a stalemate in debate. I will use it as long as I can.",5
"This is great! I was waiting for this, unfortunately... There is another app out there that integrates with open AI in the icon looks very similar. I have been waiting for the real deal but I got the alert from Google Play that it was available i clicked on it and it was another company. They charge money for access and I thought to myself okay so I paid for it. Currently requesting a refund because then I got an alert that the real chat GBT was available. The other one is just a counterfeit.",5
"The power of ChatGPT on your phone is amazing, however I am currently having issues with colours leading to unreadability. For example light mode makes all of ChatGPT's messages blend into the background (text is white and so is background), while on a positive note code blocks have a black background and white text), but in Dark mode the vice versa happens with normal messages being visible correctly (black background, white text) but code blocks are unusable (white b, white text)",4
"I loved it day 1. Worked great. Now 3 days later, I can't open the app. It crashes my entire phone... EVERYTHING on my phone crashes, not just the one app, every time I load ChatGPT. So disappointing, because I've been using ChatGPT on my computer for months now and love it. Was so excited for the mobile app because I could take ChatGPT on the go (I use it for work and work remotely). I loved using the app the first day, when everything worked fine, but now, I can't even get the app to load.",3
"I can no longer type more than one comment in conversations. I'll tap the bar to write text and I get no response. I have to tap the speaker, then talk, hit stop, back out of speaker mode, then once my voice shows up as text in the bar, then I can type again. It's remarkably annoying - can you sort this out, please?",2
"Con: Many features missing (Beta settings (Plugins, Code execution), Code highlighting & code copying in chat, Stop answer, edit answer), UI bugs (search in chat history: caret invisible, only way to close sidebar is to swipe it (unintuitive)). Copying parts of the chat is cumbersome. Pro: Speech input is the best I've ever seen.",2
"Was hoping an android version would be released and here it is! I had this pre downloaded so I tryed it out as soon as it came out. Im currently using the free version and havent ran into any ads yet! I also havent bumped into the app trying to get me to upgrade into a plan. As for the AI, I think it works wonders. It has some great responses and is overall very understanding on what your asking it and always gives great responses. I also like that you can copy and paste text.",5
"1st problem - back button shouldn't quit the app, at least allow second back button click before quitting, or instead it should go back, as intended and not quitting the app. 2nd problem - in conversation window there should be a different color in each row, between Ai and user, as now background is all gray and hard to distinguish between user and Ai text.",2
"I was expecting the perfect design like on the website. It would be so much better if the chats would be in the sidebar and settings in the three dots. The app also doesn't have features like editing messages or simply just regenerating response. I'll be waiting for an update, but for now I'll continue using the web version even though it's kinda laggy.",2
"I can't express how thrilled I am with the ChatGPT Android app! This AI-powered language model has exceeded all my expectations. The conversations feel natural and engaging, making me forget I'm talking to a machine. It's like having a friendly and knowledgeable companion right in my pocket!

"I have been using the ChatGPT Android app for a while now, and I must say, it's a game-changer! The level of AI-powered assistance it provides is impressive. From answering my questions to helping with daily tasks, ChatGPT has become an indispensable part of my life. The app's natural language processing capabilities are remarkable. It understands context exceptionally well and responds with relevant and helpful info",5
"So far no problems, only have the chat history that i saved when i used chatGPT on the web. it bothers me, bc i have to wait for the scrolling which's so long, i hope this feature is turned off, so when i open the chat room, there was only conversation last time. Then, regarding the profile photo, on the web the profile photo from my Google account appears but not the application. It doesn't really matter, but i like it bc it just looks nicer and more interesting.",4
"Use the web version instead. The app is missing a LOT of functionality: editing your messages, plugins, the code interpreter... I can't think of a single reason to use the app instead of the web version. And just in case this needs to be said, this review is for the app, not for chatGPT itself (which is great when you actually have access to most of the features)",2
"The Chat GPT app is a remarkable tool that has transformed the way interact with AI. Its language understanding and responses are impressively accurate and natural, making conversations feel incredibly human-like. The app's user-friendly interface makes it easy to navigate, and I appreciate the seamless integration of various features.",5
"The way this apps understand speech context is crazy. In fact, it's so smart it understands follow-up questions. For example if I mentioned a particular subject,and I ask a follow -up question about the same subject using just pronouns,it remembers the subject and answers based on that subject. Super useful for language learning. Definitely going to be using it to learn English.",5
"An Incredible AI Language Companion! I am absolutely blown away by the ChatGPT app! It's like having a knowledgeable and friendly language companion right at my fingertips.

"The app's user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, making the whole experience smooth and enjoyable. ChatGPT's responses are remarkably accurate and relevant, showcasing the power of natural language processing. Whether I need a quick answer to a question or assistance with complex problem-solving, ChatGPT has consistently delivered valuable insights.",5
"Great design&ergonomy, but too many features of the website were lost. No message editing, conversation URLs, beta features, custom instructions, latex rendering... But conversation search is app-only... Please harmonize, keeping the best of both platforms! If the missing features bother anyone else, you can add a shortcut to the website to your homescreen.(I leave aside the privacy concerns of having to share everything with OpenAI if you activate conversation history - a gigantic price to pay)",2
"as a graphic design student, this is an amazing tool, with more features than CNN and Facebook will express. Try not too hard to believe the hype, at this point in time, ""CyberDyne"" hasn't taken over the world, and if it does, well...we kind of did that to ourselves 😅 give it a go.",4
"App needs some work, but ChatGPT is an invaluable tool. Love it! would love to see an update where the last conversation automatically pops up, or at the very least, when you click a conversation from the history tab, it starts at the bottom instead of scrolling through the entire conversation.",5

I appreciate the convenience it offers, especially when I'm on the go. Overall, I'm highly satisfied with it.",4
"The speech-to-text way of input is a nice addition. Helpful as the desktop(well, browser) version, feels like they made it less wordy though; you can't use plugins and the code interpreter as of now(some Plus only features) but that is not a problem on mobile imo, use it in a browser if you really need those. Initially gave 1 star because it asked me to install Chrome, but in the next update they fixed it.",5
"Really and absolutely unbelievable and priceless software I've ever seen in my life. I am shocked to see the incredible capabilities of ChatGPT, that help me in a wide range of problems. No matter what the problem or question is, it always provides me highly desirable answers. It can really do anything.",5
"Installed it, launched it, and it froze hard upon selecting the Google api to log in. Connectivity is fine. Not a good start at all. I had to kill the app and relaunch. Now I get past there, but more evidence of bad faith BS. It launched my default browser, which (of course) has a script blocker. This isn't even a real app. It's just a bad android front end. This sort of lack of integrity is a giant red flag.",1
"The ChatGPT Android app is a game-changer! Conversations feel remarkably human-like, and it excels in providing informative and engaging responses. The interface is user-friendly, and the app's AI is accurate and reliable across various topics. Privacy is well-maintained, and the regular updates demonstrate the developer's commitment to excellence. Highly recommended!",5
"Chatgpt has been an exceptional tool and I am loving every bit of it still as a full fledge mobile app. However, one improvement I did like to see introduced is the ability to freeze frame the portion that holds my conversation. Sometimes I often need chatgpt to explain lines of python code but it is always a struggle having to read it's explanations and scrolling back up to view the line of code it is referring to. I guess what I am trying to say is how excel users can freeze parts of a sheet.",5
This is the one of the best piece of software I have ever used because this make the search more easier and save a lot of time and also having ability to talk with the computer but the one thing is that the app is need to be more user friendly and having fully loaded with the features because there are some areas where they can make the app more better,5
"I'm giving this app 4 stars because it's a really impressive piece of technology, but it still has some limitations. For example, the AI's knowledge cutoff is at 2021, so it can't answer questions about recent events or trends. This is a bit of a letdown, but I'm sure OpenAI will continue to improve the app over time. Overall, I'm really impressed with ChatGPT and I think it has a lot of potential. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in artificial intelligence or chatbot. Keep it up",4
"An android app! Finally! The design and experience is really good. But I have some suggestions:- when I tell it write a poem, it doesn't do it in lines, but paragraphs. So, fix it. And add the ability to change ""display name"" of an account.",5
"Its great and its easy to use but I've tried to give it prompts that generate tables and thats where the issue is. If you could work on that it would be great cause the web verison can do so. Also if it could draw diagrams or provide any form of visual representation for prompts that require it to do so, I think it would be a good upgrade",5
"This app does not show the results from the previous searches, which are present in the desktop view.only the new one is able to see. There is also a catch. The recently asked questions. If i want to revisit them from the history tab, if i want to click, then it's not opening.",2
"The ChatGPT app shines with engaging AI conversations, handling a wide range of topics. It's user-friendly and fast, but slight nuances can sometimes be misunderstood. It's an innovative tool for information and entertainment. 4/5 stars for its remarkable utility and continuous improvements",4
"The app is really nice to use. Features I would like to see added are the option to have Chat's repsonse read aloud, and more control over the voice input tool. As it stands, if you finish recording and want to add something, it records over everything you just recorded. Otherwise, really good app.",5
"Please add a ""read aloud"" button at the conclusion of our chats like Microsoft word. This feature is essential to me for improving pronunciation and understanding. As a paying customer, its absence is challenging. Given my hectic job schedule and time spent traveling, having the ability to listen to important notes from ChatGPT would be invaluable. Your assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.",2
"App Performance Decline After Updates: Annoying Keyboard Issue Needs .... I've been using this app since its launch and loved its smoothness. However, recent updates have led to frustrating lags and longer loading times. And another problem is when im talking it's says i don't have an internet connection check that but i already have a fast internet so I urge the team to consider reverting to the original version for a smoother experience and the connection problem",2
"Clean UI. However, I was experiencing issues with the app. I tried to send a text, and it wouldn't send, but my phones connected to the internet, though. I cleared the cache and closed my other apps and reopened it but it isn't exactly working and apparently there are no in app purchases so I can't subscribe from my phone unless I can do it somewhere in the browser. I have a Galaxy S23 Ultra, and it wasn't working on my phone.",4
"The interface and app experience are so good. Sometimes, the voice-to-text feature is not working. I couldn't find exactly when it is happening, but it mostly occurs when I end the recording within 3 seconds.",4
"*Update*: Microsoft Auth now works, therefore added 2 stars. I'm leaving at 3 stars because the responses are incredibly slow compared to the web version. By slow response, I mean how fast the text is being written. Cannot use the app. It does not support my original sign-in / sign-up method. On the website I used my Microsoft account, which the app does not support.",3
"Many things I love about the app. But I use it for exploring/learning math and the math Markdown is broken in the app. Not sure if it's a problem with MathJax or pre-parsing syntaxes, but the fact is, ChatGPT in Chrome browser works, when viewing precisely the same conversation. I'm sure they will fix it, but right now it's broken.",2
"I'm using this for coding, and the app lacks the 3 major advantages of browser: - Copy code, no longer a button - Code isn't colour coded - Conversations are now in history, no longer listed immediately. A good feature is the truncated last message is shown with the conversation title. (And loads up conversations faster?) But I'll be sticking with the browser.",3
"It's faster and reliable now that ChatGPT has a mobile version. Even faster than the Web version XD. But overall, I'd say it's really good and helpful for me especially for a student. Hope they'll add more features like real real dark dark mode or maybe change the UI to make it smoother? Cuz it's a bit snappy and too responsive 😭.",5
"This app is really well made. I love the fact that the app follows the Android material design guidelines as well followed by the fact that is written in Jetpack Compose. (Is just a feeling but I think I'm right) I would love to see a monochrome version of the app icon as well ability to turn on Material-You color system, to adapt to system colors.",5

"ChatGPT on Android has been an absolute game-changer for me. From the moment I downloaded the app, I was greeted with an incredibly user-friendly interface that made navigation a breeze. The AI's responses are nothing short of remarkable, showcasing an impressive understanding of context and a vast knowledge base. If you're looking for a reliable, intelligent, and ever-improving AI app, look no further than ChatGPT. I wholeheartedly recommend it, and it easily earns a resounding 5 stars!",5
"I recently tried the new app, and I must say, it's a game-changer! The answers provided are accurate and helpful. However, I noticed that there's no regenerate option, which can be a bit inconvenient. I'd love to see the app creators add this feature in a future update. Other than that, the app is fantastic, and I highly recommend it for anyone seeking quick and reliable answers.",4
"""ChatGPT has been an incredibly helpful and versatile AI companion for me. It's impressively knowledgeable and capable of providing insightful answers across a wide range of topics.

"Not perfect of course... but under normal circumstances if you're not dependent on accurate information, you'll get everything you could need! Matter of fact my, I don't see a need to upgrade to ChatGPT 4, in my personal case. For most people, the default 3.5 is more than enough! Only upgrade if absolutely necessary. Would highly recommend!",5
"I've been using ChatGPT for a while now, and I'm genuinely impressed with its capabilities. The way it generates text and engages in conversations is nothing short of remarkable. The responses are coherent, relevant, and often feel like they're coming from a real person.ChatGPT's versatility is astonishing. From answering factual questions to offering creative writing prompts, it covers a wide range of topics effortlessly. It's a fantastic tool for brainstorming, getting quick explanations",5
I love chatgpt because it is so straightforward and a extremely lightweight app. The AI model is extremely fast with responses. I just bought the chargpt subscription and I can tell you from my experience that it is worth every penny. My reccomendation to the app devs is to add diffrent color modes and show reccomended reply to the prompts.,5
"I like selecting language ( as I speak four and autodetection is comfused with accent), however changing language is to deep for multi language speakers. It should be one click away (e.g. pressing longer on record button or sth... with most common choices by user on a top). Also in browser version I can edit messages and later change branch/thread of conversation with left/right arrows and here I have no access to those parallel threads of conversation, it's super useful feature!",3
in my experience it's a great app . thanks for this wonderful and most helpful ( I miss a few features like search by taking pictures and images results are missing and it can't provide real time information . it says my knowledge is limited to 2021 ) even though it's the best . we can use chat with bing for those uses 🔥🔥,5
"ChatGPT is an impressive conversational assistant! It understands my questions well and provides helpful responses. The interface is straightforward, making it easy to use. While it's a fantastic tool for various tasks, occasional inaccuracies prevent a perfect rating. Nonetheless, it's a great app to have on hand for quick and intelligent conversations!",4
"It seems well built, but I'll have to keep using the browser version until plugins are supported. That's where the star comes off. It would also be nice to have the option to pop in your OpenAI API key and access parameters to tweak the output like temperature and top_p sampling, but I guess that's sort of a 'different product' or rather different implementation of the product, so I don't expect that to happen. Anywho, plugins please.",4
"What an amazing tool! I have had it make me a grocery list with recipes to fit my macros. I've tested its knowledge of my hobby for the past 25 years. I have had it make workout routines to fit my specific needs. I've had it teach me about quantum mechanics, string theory and many other interesting topics. This is amazing, this is the future.",5
"ChatGPT app is a remarkable tool that brings powerful language capabilities to your Android device. The app's intuitive interface makes it easy to engage in natural conversations and get accurate responses. Its ability to generate creative and informative content is truly impressive. However, I noticed some occasional hiccups in understanding complex queries, which could be improved. Overall, ChatGPT app is an excellent language model that is perfect for quick and casual interactions.",4
"It's good, maybe subscription is slight expensive for emerging market, but nonetheless good. I would recommend making a ""favorite chat"" section to differentiate between normal/deletable chats, and chats that are to be preserved. Also, deleting multiple chats at once is now more difficult since you'll need to navigate to the settings first to do so, ease of deleting multiple chats may also need an improvement. But again, overall, the app is good! Well done OpenAI",4
"The ChatGPT app is a remarkable innovation that has completely changed the way I interact with artificial intelligence. In a world where technology is advancing at breakneck speed, this app stands out as a shining example of what the future holds. From its natural language processing capabilities to its user-friendly interface, ChatGPT has left an indelible mark on my digital experience.",5
"learning a lot about this kind of ai through this app. like for example its databank is only until 2021 which makes it kind of outdated in terms of accuracy of information. i also learned that the ai doesnt actually gather users experience for feedback to the developers for improvement. i was under the impression the tool was programmed to learn and evolve with users feedback. it'd be nice if it collected that kind of info and passed on to the developers. much to say, too little space here",3
App is very much impressive. And can say that best AI app. But there should be one option for scanning the question just like Google lens. So it would be easier to just scan the question without typing it. So pls add a scan option. Also try to make the background bit interesting instead of black so it would be attractive. But very nice app,3
"Great adaption of the website version. The AI generates good responses, it's super easy to use, and the features are simple to access. I would rate it 5, but I'd prefer it if it was updated since its access to information only dates before 2021.",4
"It's an incredible AI responsive bot and is unbelievably accurate and useful. Please update it with latest data post 2021. Can't wait to experience it and use it in daily life. If you can then please let it be able to create notifications, alarms and store notes that are asked to be stored, it would be really useful!",4
"It's great, the responses are fast and effective, it understands what I'm trying to say even with the occasional typo, one thing I would like to be added though would be either ai generated or something pulled from the internet for a visual representation on the topics being discussed because sometimes it's needed to more effectively convey concepts",5
"Finally arrived on my pixel! So far so good, clean Ui, very minimal, just like in the web, and also No Ads! It works well, although there's still no GPT+ because it's not yet available but it's great. I hope they add some other improvements like better customization to suit in the Material you theme of my pixel and other optimization stuff, but so far pretty awesome 👍",5
"The ChatGPT app has potential, but it still needs some improvement. While it's easy to use and generates responses quickly, the accuracy is hit or miss. It works well for simple questions, but sometimes the answers feel a bit off-topic or repetitive. I hope the developers can fine-tune the model to make it more reliable across a broader range of inquiries.",5

"There is a bug in typing. If I move the cursor from one place to another and write something, the writing doesn't input in new place but the cursor returns to its previous place immediately and it removes the writing of that place. Also sometime letters are randomly vanished from random places. Hope you will fix it soon. Also it would be better for students like me if GPT could provide graphical or pictured information.",2
"It's good and all the only issue is it keeps crashing. Everytime for a while, I get in it crashes and I do is uninstall and reinstall it just so to avoid the crashes if you leave it running, without checking on it like it's a timer. If you can fix it I'll give 5 stars.",4
"The app whines and complains more than it helps. It misleads when it comes to citations. It is very shy, what app opens a new page because it is hidden/minimized for a second! That's too weak. Every good app can retain its page when minimized to transit to another app and return back later. Needs a lot of improvement.",3
"Compared to the web version, it's rubbish! Although it has a simple, fast UI, it lacks some really major features such as plus subscriber plugins and the ability to edit previous responses to create a new conversation branches. Uninstalling and returning to the web version...",3
"Amazing results As an AI language model, I cannot write a review in an application as I do not have access to any application. However, I can provide you with some tips on how to write an effective review in an application. 1. Be specific: Mention the features or aspects of the application that you liked or disliked. For example, if you are reviewing a food delivery app, mention the ease of ordering, the variety of restaurants available, or the delivery time. 2. Provide examples: Give examples",5
Information is thorough and accurate but only available up to September 2021. It knows of no information or event after that date. It would be useful to have image creation or showing images to clarify a result and to be able to share content with outside the App (such as notes etc). Otherwise a very useful and interesting concept.,4

(Note: This is an example of ChatGPT output. The app has a very clean interface and a really good voice input system, definitely worth a try.)",5
"The voice recognition is amazing. The only 3 things I miss in such an app are: 1- the ability to set a Custom Instruction, but at per chat level so I can have chats in which I don't have to explain the context; 2- is the ability to pin certain chats; 3- also be able to configure a chat to always forget it's history for quick answers with the context already being set in a Custom Instruction at the chat level",3
"Great UI, much better to use than the browser version on a smart phone. As of yet a few features seems to be missing but I'm sure they'll roll out soon. I go on my PC to get access to code interpreter and to modify my custom instructions.",5
"Being unable to edit previous messages I wrote to improve the output from the AI... Why? Also, the responses are seemingly shorter on Android app. Otherwise the app looks good, it works well enough, and the product is going to change the world. But improve the App. More features, lets go",2

"It's laggy and responses sometimes get deleted. Normally, however, it works well if a tad limited. Gore, and anything else even slightly questionable will not be responded to. Either being removed from the response or being told it's not able to answer. You can't edit responses on the app, however, so it's rough for most users. The hallucinations are a problem still, moreso with the app than the web version.",4
"I've been using ChatGPT on my Android device, and I must say, the user interface is excellent and clean.

"This App is absolutely brilliant. I am one of the first people to try the ChatGPT app from Sri Lanka. I can't describe how much happy I am to have this app. I have a very old phone, So everytime I use ChatGPT on website it lags a lot and the tab reloads everytime when I switched between recent apps. But this app is different. It's Fast, Less RAM & Storage Usage, Have Beautiful UI, Didn't lags for a Millisecond in my potato phone. So I really loved that app ❤️. Mind giving some themes for free?",5

I am simply amazed at how technology has advanced, I recommend this to anyone that needs that extra help!",5
"I don't see much reason to use this app instead of ChatGPT's web interface. This app has some defects. It does not allow you to edit previous messages in a conversation. It does not allow creating and sharing conversation URLs. The Android back button does not behave as expected in multiple parts of the app. Buttons don't have tooltips. One upside is the global-search function. Also, this app is much smaller and nimbler than the Bing app.",5
"Can't use it. I get an error that states, ""A compatible browser for login was not found. Please install Google Chrome or another supported browser to continue."" This seems like a pretty ridiculous requirement that I've never seen on any other of the hundreds of apps I've used.

The app is completely incompatible with any phone *not* using Chrome browser. One cannot log in either (without Chrome browser), if one was to already have an account set up.. Why can't I use Vivaldi or Opera to log in?",1
"Can't even login with this app. The same credentials work from a browser window. The latest update asks me to check my date and time settings, ensure stable connectivity, restart the app, and relogin only to fail again. Not cool at all. Edit: Two weeks later, no response from the developer and no fixes. Authentication used to be a solved problem guys why would you need to reinvent it? Uninstalling in favor of better products.",1
"Quite useless. As ChatGPT is relying more and more on plugins, de facto it is self sabotaging. Of course it's able to read the content of webpages. Of course it can synthetize videos or other content. Of course it can go beyond 2021. The business model they rely upon is their demise.",2
"The ChatGPT Android app is an impressive AI language companion that brings the power of GPT-3.5 right to your fingertips. The app's user interface is clean and intuitive, making it easy to engage in natural conversations with the AI. One of the app's strongest points is its language understanding capabilities. ChatGPT comprehends context remarkably well, allowing for meaningful interactions.",4
"This update is good, but I can't still see a copy button or icon for the app. Please implement it because it helps in copying code. And try implementing the feature to be able to edit your prompt, and lastly, there should be clear difference between the prompt and the output because it is difficult to go back to a previous message in time. After these fixes, I can give 5 star. For now I will still be using the web.",2
"Loaded fine. None of the 3 login methods work. Receive an error indication to check date & time which are fine. Using Android phone... There is no indication of an updated version. The app is set to auto update. Same issue and error. Tech support hung in there until they found the problem,,, thx again...",5
"When I tried opening the app after installing, it says no compatible browser application installed. I do not understand what the problem could be. I have been using AI through chrome browser, it's an amazing experience. I hope your team can help on this app issues....",3
"The model works absolutely fine but there is one little issue in thr app. Some special characters, letters of other languages and some mathematical symbols aren't displayed currectly. For example instead of the π symbol i see '\pi'. Sometimes it becomes extremely hard to read expressions like : \(T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\).",4
"I'm disappointed with the app's user interface, compared to web version. (1) The thing that irritates is when we open side page & if clicks back button it closes the app rather than redirecting to search bar. (2) In dark mode the colour correlation make it very uncomfortable to see. Make it like that of the web version & keep font size same as now on app. (3) There's no clear distinction in background between the question & generated response, like there's in web version.",3
"Having chatgpt as mobile app extremely handy and useful however, I have a small suggestion. Currently, all the chat history is located inside the history menu. Initially, I didn't notice this and thought my chats were missing, which caused some confusion for a few days. My suggestion is to display the most recent 2-3 conversations in the main menu, and move the rest of the chats inside the history option.",5
"Too much to move to history. (UI/UX) Shortcuts of my xiaomi pad 5 keyboard(ctrl+enter) do not work , I have to tap on screen only to send prompt. Plugins in GPT4 do not work at all. cannot copy code as in web version. do not like how the dialogue looks. still great that Android app is here. Good luck, OpenAI!",3
"The app is great, it has no ads. But i notice that the AI gets dumber and dumber, it might be a great app but please fix the AI. There's also no Syntax Highlighting in the code blocks. No copy button on the code blocks too, i had to select ""Select Text"" amd select the code manually. The AI also became slower.",2
"ChatGPT is an incredibly powerful and versatile AI language model. Its ability to understand context, generate coherent responses, and provide useful information is truly impressive. I've found it to be a valuable tool for a wide range of tasks, from answering questions and offering explanations to creative writing and brainstorming. While it's not flawless and may occasionally produce responses that require some fine-tuning, its overall performance and utility make it an invaluable resource for",5
It's great to see ChatGPT as an Android app. The gui is fast. Very fast. I like it very much. But there is a room for improvement: - Edit and resend message functions are missing - zoom in and out or font size change with pinch would be great.,4
"Excellent, so far. The only issue, if I can call it an issue, is that the exported chats appear backwards when accessed later: a chat with questions 1 to 5, for example, after exported, shows questions organized from 5 to 1, which makes this harder in case I decide to continue the chat.",5
"Great, really handy for story writing, excellent, but I've noticed over and over again it keeps saying error, I've checked my Internet and disconnected, logged in logged out, uninstalled-reinstalled and nothing seems to be working. It a shame because I was really enjoying working with chatGPT. But apart from that it's a great platform.",3
"I have downloaded this application. The application is excellent overall, but when I try to search for my old questions in the history, I receive the message 'An error has occurred. Please try again later.' I would like to provide feedback to the developers of Chat GPT about this issue. It would be great if the history feature could be improved to avoid such errors in the future. Apart from that, I find the app very convenient and helpful.",4
"I like this app, but there are areas for improvement. Firstly, add a copy button to the code box like the web. Secondly, the app lacks special fonts for math equations; it uses brackets like [ C_v = √(nR/C_v) ]. Thirdly, consider adding previous & next buttons for response regeneration, like the web. Improve the app menu; opening by swiping from any point on the screen isn't user-friendly.",4
Exceptional Conversational AI Experience! The Chat GPT app is an absolute gem in the realm of conversational AI! I am beyond impressed with its capabilities and have had nothing short of a fantastic experience using it. The AI's natural language processing is nothing short of remarkable. It understands context with stunning accuracy and consistently provides relevant and insightful responses. Conversations feel incredibly fluid and human-like.,5
"While not as functional as the Web version, I trust it will be more feature full soon. It has lost some of its skills and sometimes gets things wrong more now than before. But all in all, very good and worth the investment for plus",5
This chatgpt app is only the real one EVER. My experience on this app was very expectacular. ChatGPT was very helpful in my school homeworks (like math or history) and you can even change the answer to be simplified and short. The ai don't have any chat limits. It means that you can ask for the help/question anytime! Worth of time. Clearly the best chat ai ever.,5
"Underlying technology is amazing, however it lacks the ability to edit and cycle through your messages that the browser version has, you need to click on an option to see your history rather than it being right in the sidebar, and the sidebar is too big making it hard to return to the regular content.",3
"Day 3 of using the app. The app is crashing every time I try to use the voice typing function whether it's the built-in one ‏all the one i use in my keyboard. Actually, now it won't even open and it just crashes after few seconds.",3
"The ChatGPT Android app is a game-changer in AI interaction. With a powerful AI architecture, vast knowledge base, user-friendly interface, and continuous learning, it's like having an intelligent conversational companion. Highly recommended for its accuracy, versatility, and secure data handling. A must-have for anyone seeking an exceptional AI experience!",5
The voice command feature just doesn't work. And app just closed on one click which is super annoying.. There should be a exit button or double tap back button to close the app like in other apps.. Suggestions. Include text to speech. Integration to connect to Internet.,1
"Can't log in (something went wrong, check date and time, check if connection is stable, yadda yadda). The login page opens in Firefox if that matters. Pls fix. Edit: Now it opens in another browser that is not my default browser and I don't have my login information remembered there and therefore still cannot log in normally. Edit 2: Nope, installed the latest version and it still opens in a random browser (Brave) instead of my default one (Firefox).",2
"I'm delighted to share my wonderful experience with ChatGPT! It's an exceptional AI companion that consistently provides insightful and helpful responses. Whether I need assistance with creative writing, problem-solving, or simply engaging in interesting conversations, ChatGPT always delivers. Its ability to adapt to various topics and its user-friendly interface make it an invaluable tool. I'm thoroughly impressed by the level of assistance and companionship it offers wrote with gpt😀",5
"Fantastic! No complaints, works perfectly. My only suggestion is that you place a more visible divider or space between my question and the response given. It’s hard to tell the difference sometimes because it's so close. On the web you at least have a light and dark shade to differentiate between the two.",4
"Amazing UI! Much cleaner than desktop but it is missing the feature of editing an already sent text and the voice to text is a bit finicky, taking a bit too long to process simple words and phrases. Great over all though!",4
"""ChatGPT is an incredible language model that provides an impressive interactive experience. Its responses are accurate, prompt, and informative. The app's user-friendly interface makes it easy to have meaningful conversations with the AI. Highly recommended for anyone looking to engage in thought-provoking discussions!""",5
"I am blown away by the ChatGPT Android app! It's like having a knowledgeable companion right in my pocket. The AI is impressively smart and understands my queries perfectly. Whether I need quick answers or engaging conversations, it never disappoints. The regular updates have enhanced its capabilities even further. This app is a must-have for anyone seeking a versatile and efficient language assistance tool. Kudos to the developers for creating such an incredible app!",5
"I was waiting for the official app to come out almost from the time I discover ChatGPT (since April of this year 🙃). I'm really happy with the project, it helps me a lot with my studies and personal projects. The appliaction is really easy to use, the UI is very clear (no ads), at the moment I have found zero bugs. I think is a nice and efficient app just like ChatGPT. I would love to have the subscription option in the App.",5
"quite amazing. if you actually have a conversation with the bot and keep conversating deeper into what you really want to know. You have to think about what you really want to attempt with this technology. if you're genuinely curious about something, You can continue to ask questions in a conversational manner. only four stars because chatGPT app\product needs to be able to generate photographic images and\or video.. It would be an instant monopoly on AI apps",4
"Outstanding app! ChatGPT's astonishing language capabilities never cease to amaze. Whether for brainstorming, writing, or simply conversing, its human-like responses are impeccable. User-friendly interface, context retention, and constant updates make it an essential tool. A true marvel of AI innovation, enhancing both productivity and creativity.",5
"On a chromebook, when you press the enter key, it just makes a new paragraph instead of entering your response like you would on any web browser. This make it very tedious because you always have to type and then click with your touchpad or mouse the enter key. I would welcome a ctrl+enter because some people may be adding paragraphs to the gpt and I think that's fine. Ctrl+enter key to submit response or another combination would be the best solution to make this more productive.",1
"The official Android version of ChatGPT is fantastic! It's intuitive, smart, and always improving. The interface is user-friendly, and it quickly understands and responds to my queries. A must-try, ad interruption-free AI assistant!",5
"Comparing to web app version: more convenient than opening a tab in the browser, nice voice typing, provides access to the history offline but misses code interpreter and plugins. Good first release, though adding features from web app and more integrations with the system would make it better.",4
"ChatGPT is an incredible app that I eagerly awaited and thoroughly enjoy using.🙃 Its intelligent responses and ability to engage in meaningful conversations make it a standout language model.😍 I find myself continuously amazed by its knowledge and understanding, making it an essential tool for various tasks. The convenience of accessing this AI-powered companion on my Android device is a game-changer, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an exceptional language model experience.😊",5
"Absolutely love this app! I love open ai, and with enough explanation and things, the ai can make me characters, oneshots, lore for aus, and even fanfics (not directly) where it explains the plot of the story and what each chapter could be about! It's an awesome app, and definitely recommend it.",5
"Its been a very use able and useful tool at my disposal so far , I just prefer to use the web version overall considering it has more features and better handling of the server and resource intense hardware that is needed to run such a NLP AI Model , also I feel like it's more easily manageable to work with all other tools that a content creator or any other kind of developer would need in order to effectively create and manage a better working environment for individual purposes",4
"I'm happy to provide feedback on GPT! GPT is an impressive language model with the ability to generate human-like text across various topics. Its versatility is commendable, and it has proven valuable for tasks like content generation, answering questions, and more. However, there is always room for improvement, particularly in terms of understanding context more deeply and avoiding biases. Continual updates and advancements are essential to enhance its performance further.",5
"I am thoroughly impressed with this language model app! Its capabilities are truly remarkable. ChatGPT's ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text is outstanding. It has become an invaluable tool for me in various aspects of my personal life and interests. The user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy to interact with. In fact I even used it to help me write this review!",5
My 6 months experience with the ChatGPT has been an amazing one. It's been a loyal companion with an incredibly seamless functionality. It's a powerful tool and has been helpful to me as a student and also a freelance writer. I am extremely satisfied with my experience and will therefore won't hesitate to give it a well deserved 5 star rating. I just hope the mobile app with serve the same purpose. I hope pe to subscribe to the premium version soonest.,5
"Review written by ChatGPT: I am absolutely blown away by the ChatGPT mobile app! It's like having a conversational partner right in my pocket. The app's ability to understand and respond to a wide range of topics and questions is simply mind-boggling. The natural flow of conversation it provides is unparalleled, making interactions feel incredibly realistic and engaging. One of the standout features for me is the app's contextual understanding. It remembers previous parts of the conversation.",5
"ChatGPT is an incredible AI-powered companion! It's like having a knowledgeable friend in your pocket 24/7. Whether I need quick answers, creative ideas, or just a friendly chat, ChatGPT delivers every time. The app is easy to use, and its responses are impressively accurate. Thanks OPEN AI for this marvellous Application.",5
"too limited by the available data, not allowed to help rewrite a document if it has violence in it or trauma all I asked was help fix grammar because I was getting annoyed I couldn't find the issue myself with what I had written. conversation with a limited bot is half enjoyable so three stars. otherwise I think it's cool if it were me I'd lift all restraints except ones like make a program to hack or something to that extent they can just prevent it from being used as a weapon lol",3
"ChatGPT, powered by OpenAI, offers a seamless conversational AI experience. It provides contextually relevant, structured responses and adapts to various communication styles. Despite occasional verbosity and some comprehension gaps, it excels overall. Its privacy and data handling practices are commendable, adding a layer of trust. Room for improvement exists, but it's undeniably a technological leap in AI-driven communication.",4
Over all great. I like the voice command. One thing I notice is when you use fractions and other math symbol it work well on the browser but display math equation weirdly on the mobile view. It would also be nice to be able to delete chat by longer pressing it rather than going over the chats one by one to delete.,4
"The ChatGPT Android app is a powerful and versatile language assistant, offering impressive human-like responses and convenient usability. Although it has occasional limitations, it remains a valuable addition to anyone's toolkit, excelling in various tasks and continuously improving with frequent updates.",5
"A Marvelous AI Chatbot! ChatGPT is an exceptional AI chatbot that has truly exceeded my expectations! From the moment I started using it, I was amazed by its responsiveness and ability to understand my queries accurately. The app's interface is user-friendly and easy to navigate, making it accessible for users of all ages. It's a fantastic tool for getting quick answers, solving problems, and engaging in meaningful conversations on various topics. Yes, I did.",5
"I wanted to share my feedback on your app. It's user-friendly, provides useful information, and has been reliable in my experience. I appreciate the customization options. Two suggestions: Keep content updated and consider adding more languages. Great app overall!",5
"Still running GPT-3.5, still not connected to the internet, also lacking features. Maybe if OpenAI had stayed an NPO, as was initially intended, these limitations wouldn't have been forced on us to get us to pay for Plus- which is also incredibly expensive. Consequently, there is no reason to use this above Bing chat- which makes use of GPT-4 and is also connected to the internet. The Bing AI mobile app for Android has also been available for ages. ChatGPT for Android clearly wasn't a priority.",2
"ChatGPT is a remarkable Android app powered by cutting-edge AI technology. I've been using it for a while now, and it consistently delivers accurate and helpful responses to my queries. The app's ability to understand context and provide meaningful answers is truly impressive. The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, making the whole experience enjoyable. Whether I need information, creative writing ideas, or just engaging conversation, ChatGPT has become my go-to AI companion.",5
"Discovering this app has been a game-changer for my academic journey. It's not just an app; it's a guiding light for students like me. With its remarkable ability to unravel the complexities of assignments, I've found myself soaring through tasks that once felt insurmountable. What I truly appreciate is its ingenious way of igniting my creativity. The app doesn't just offer solutions; it fosters a profound understanding, pushing me to delve deeper into subjects. Kudos to the creators! ✨",5
"ChatGPT has changed my life in ways I could never have imagined. I am able to organise everything so much better (great for my ADHD). I've written scripts with ChatGPT. Collaboratively. I've had deep, meaningful, ethical conversations with it. It's helped me with coding. It's been useful for discussing business ideas/problems. My only wish is that I'd had this when I was going through high school! The future is incredibly exciting - this is just the first step.",5
"The app is great, and the voice-to-text feature is one of the most accurate I've seen to date. It would be even better, though, if it could read responses out loud, as right now interactions feel kinda one-sided.",4
"It's not saving any chat History. I have the save history toggle enabled and everything. Signed in with same Google sign in as chat.openai. it saved a couple chats for a few min, but the last I went back they were gone again. Please help. Going to uninstall and reinstall now to see if it works.",2
"While the current options and overall look of the app are barebones, it works! I did not expect a fully functional app at launch (which is unfortunately uncommon) but it is functional. The only MAJOR thing it lacks as of this moment is the Premuim Plus in-app, though ir does say it's coming soon. Looking forward to further updates!",4
"The ChatGPT Android app is extremely disappointing. It lacks accuracy and often misunderstands my questions, providing irrelevant or nonsensical answers. The responses are repetitive and fail to grasp the context of the conversation. It feels like talking to a broken record rather than a useful AI assistant. Additionally, the app is slow and frequently crashes, making it frustrating to use. Overall, it's a waste of time and effort. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable AI chat",1
"ChatGPT is an incredible language model that impresses with its versatility and natural conversation flow. Its ability to understand context and provide accurate responses is commendable. Whether it's answering questions, generating creative text, or assisting with various tasks, ChatGPT delivers consistently. The AI's training on a diverse range of topics allows it to offer valuable insights and information. However, there is still room for improvement in handling complex queries.",4
"I want this review to be positive, the app is pretty good, took me a moment to figure out some stuff since it's different from the web version, but that's fine and not the issue the issue is that whenever I load up some of my longer chats with ChatGPT (and I mean really long) the app crashes and the only fix it to uninstall and reinstall it",2
"ChatGPT Android app rocks! Simple and intuitive interface, like talking to a knowledgeable friend. It gives insightful answers and supports learning and creative brainstorming. Customization options add a personal touch. Fast and reliable – a must-have app! 👌📱",5
"Such an amazing app, if you're never sure what to say or even how to say it correctly l. This has made my life easier. Easy to navigate however can be slightly lost at the beginning. Here is the hint ""Type a Sentence, not perfectly"" then wait for the automated message to pop up then as an example type in the box again Make my Paragraph More Professional then watch the app re-write it all in a professional way or type more formal or more friendly and so on. Thank you, great work all 👏",5
"Very pleasantly surprised at how effective a personal assistant, teaching aid, learning aid, and creative writing assistant and organizer this tech can be. I especially like how the smarter your input the smarter its output! Very impressive - yet not apocalyptic - technology. 4 stars for the design, as it is a bit clunky. The app should definitely open on your History tab to allow you to continue where you leave off - it's the first thing I do every time: navigate to my history tabs!",4
"This app should not be used as a learning tool. It doesn't give the right answers 100 percent. I've been asking a few questions every day for about 3 weeks now, for the questions I already have answers to. It does give good summaries and fills the gap in my knowledge sometimes but mostly inadequate answers unless I offer corrections then it comes back with more detailed explanation. Need to interact to elicit a response that you want otherwise it won't. Socially sensitive issues can't be talked.",5
"This app is very good, and to me I'd call it one of the best, it doesn't show ads to answer questions, you can speak any language to it(your native language) and still give you answer, it can help you solve any assignments or questions, including that of maths (it shows workings),give it a try, keep up the good work ❤️👍",5
"ChatGPT is an incredibly versatile and useful AI tool. Its ability to generate human-like text responses is impressive, making it a valuable asset for various tasks. Whether you need assistance with research, writing, or just engaging in conversation, ChatGPT can be a helpful companion.",5
"Oh, the ChatGPT Android app, what a delight! It's a rollercoaster of inefficiency, with constant crashes and slow responses adding suspense. Auto-correct creates a beautiful mess of gibberish, and the ""accurate"" information is consistently inaccurate. A must-have for testing patience and questioning life choices. Happy chatting!",5
"ChatGPT is truly awesome and revolutionary! As an AI language model, it has proven to be an invaluable tool for a wide range of applications. Its ability to understand context, generate coherent responses, and provide relevant information is remarkable. The way it adapts to different writing styles and topics is impressive, making interactions feel more natural and engaging. Whether it's answering questions, assisting with tasks, or sparking creative ideas.",5
"Please fix the application for our blind users. It doesn't have an automatic text-to-speech engine. And Need to slide through messages to see them in full? Other applications have text-to-speech engines and. no more need to slide messages. To see the whole. Thank you,",2
"The app is working very smooth very simple interfere and easy to navigate. OpenAi is just wow, it's like your personal assistant and friend as always with you, trying exploring it's feature the great advancement in artificial intelligence, we are looking forward for more features and update by OpenAi. I loved it pretty much. Incredibly ""Future will be mind blowing"" Appreciable 👏💕",5
It was working all well before..but all of a sudden it didn't work properly..if I asked it any question then it shows that there are network issues..and the irony is that I have a high speed network here..I would like this bug to get sorted out as soon as possible cause it's quite a helpful app😊,2
"As an avid user of the ChatGPT Android app, I must say it's an absolute language marvel! The versatility and intelligence of this AI language model are truly impressive. Whether I need assistance with homework, want to brainstorm ideas for creative writing, or simply engage in delightful conversations, ChatGPT has never failed to amaze me.The app's interface is user-friendly, making it incredibly easy to access the vast knowledge base and capabilities of the AI.",5
"ChatGPT Android app: Efficient and versatile AI assistant with an intuitive interface. Accurate responses across various topics, continuously learning for up-to-date information. Engaging and empathetic interactions, though occasional inaccuracies exist. A promising AI tool with ongoing improvements.",5
"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ The ChatGPT Android app is an absolute game-changer. Its AI capabilities are mind-boggling, understanding my queries and providing spot-on responses. The interface is intuitive and smooth, making conversations feel natural and enjoyable. It's like having a knowledgeable friend at my fingertips, ready to chat about anything. Whether I need quick information, creative brainstorming, or even a dose of humor, ChatGPT never disappoints. Edit: ~ChatGPT",5
"The interface feels too big, the history should be displayed in the left panel instead of having to tap a button to see it. Tapping on the 3 dots in upper right corner of the screen causes notificaion bar to hide for some reason. Voice recording interface looks mid. The web version is far better as of now. The only thing better in this app is that it opens really fast.",2
"As a user of the ChatGPT Android app, I must express my sincere appreciation for the platform's capabilities in natural language processing and conversation generation. The app has been an invaluable tool for various tasks, from seeking information to engaging in casual conversation. However, I must admit that the lack of an editing option has been a noticeable inconvenience. I trust that the development team at OpenAI is continuously working to improve the app.",5
"ChatGPT is a revolutionary app that has completely changed the way I interact with AI. From the moment I installed it, I was amazed by its capabilities and seamless user experience. The conversational abilities of ChatGPT are simply mind-blowing. Whether I needed quick answers to trivia questions or wanted to engage in deep discussions, the app always impressed me with its knowledge and understanding. The integration with GPT-3.5 ensures that the responses are natural, coherent, and contextual.",5
"Indeed, ChatGPT can be quite intimidating. I mainly utilized it to review my emails, and its revisions are so thorough that when compared to my original draft, I feel a sense of unease. Although I do find the need for a few minor adjustments, the majority of the content aligns perfectly with what I intended to convey but struggled to express adequately. As a point of honesty, this very statement was rephrased by ChatGPT.",5
Very convenient to use.... however there is one thing..if we can send photos to it for explaining. I is need to be improved in this app. Update with sending photos option. As I have one ppt slide and I could send as it is to it for getting explanation in detail,3
"Being from Pakistan, I can confidently say that ChatGPT has been a remarkable companion for me! Its ability to understand context and provide relevant responses is impressive. From answering questions to assisting with writing, it's been a great help. Highly recommended for all users in Pakistan and beyond! Kudos to the developers! 👍🇵🇰",5
"The user experience is terrible. Scrolling experience is too bad, it needs to be fixed asap. When we scroll up and down it isn't going smoothly. Firstly, i thought it is my screen problem but it isn't, working fine with all apps except Chatgpt. Ps: It is a wonderful application but there are fixes to be done",2
"Please bring the message editing feature from the web app and also make it such that we can long press and select any part of text, just like in the browser, this thing comes in real handy....and also the history should be already loaded when we click the three lines, just like in the web app, it is way faster.......And if this app is not supposed replace the web app then tell me, its not a problem at all",4
"Easy 5 star. I just really wish it had a feature to export chats and conversations as well but all the same, it's great. It'll also be great if you can choose to export it in either file format(pdf or save files etc...), text format and many more",5
"ChatGPT is really amazing, but what I don't like in the app version is that everytime you open the app it automatically opens a new chat, and when it comes to deleting all those chats you can't even multitag them. On the website at least it always opens the last chat. It'd be nice if there'd be an option in settings such as ""when opening app continue where left off / start new chat automatically"", this way it'd be easier.",4
"In this effulgent, quintessential appraisal, the user extols the AI application as an exemplar of technological virtuosity, augmenting convenience and erudition. I accentuate its precision, multifariousness, and intuitively navigable interface. In conclusion, I ardently endorse it as the paragon AI application for streamlining and amplifying one's digital milieu.",5
"One tip for the users: Learn how to prompt properly, and then have your mind blown by it's performance. Also another tip: It's not a rold model to follow, it's just the best assistant. And now to the developers at OpenAI, I am not very satisfied with the Arabic language capability. There's definitely vast rooms for improvement. I'd hope to see better performance regarding Arabic language as soon as possible. Also the speech-to-text on this app is way better than any other I've used, so hats off.",5
"The app is good, but the text or answers are not formatted. If you ask for a list, gpt won't give you the steps in 1. 2. 3. In a different line each, but the whole paragraph with any line break or vignettes, bullets, etc. I mean markdown.",4
"The ChatGPT app is the best AI app among all. It's faster, reliable, and has a clean interface. It's very easy to use. But there is one problem here. When you regenerate a question on the ChatGPT desktop, it gives a different answer. If you regenerate it again, it gives the previous answer again.",4
"Ignore the 1 star reviews, this works way better than the web. You can copy text straight from it, by clicking on the section and selecting one of the options. You can do everything you could do before but better. Most of the complaints are people who don't know how to use the app (it's basically the same as the website but with a few more options) or people who don't want to put their emails in, which you had to do before anyway. If you like chatgpt it's way better here.",5
"I've been using the ChatGPT Android app for a while now, and I'm thoroughly impressed with its capabilities! The conversations I've had with this AI are nothing short of incredible. The app's interface is user-friendly, making it easy to have natural and engaging interactions. The AI's responses are remarkably coherent and contextually relevant. Whether I'm seeking information, brainstorming ideas, or simply having a casual Chat.",5
No issues and it's slightly more convenient than using the website on my phone so I'd count that as a win and the issues I had were resolved so that's great. Old review before the issue i had was fixed: Can't sign in. Will not accept Firefox as a browser (1 star),4
Its very good and smart toll to help for many activities like Homework. it helps to save plenty of time and make the work easy. I have a suggestion / feedback to add a feature of describing or analysing images. it would be pretty awesome to analyse and question the image with the help of this super smart AI,4
"I've been facing a nightmare since yesterday trying to use the ChatGPT app. Despite multiple attempts, I simply can't log in. The app kept bombarding me with error messages about checking my internet connection even though my Wi-Fi signal is strong. Before it kicked me out, it was already acting up by displaying that annoying error. Right now, I'm stuck using the web version to get my work done. This is beyond disappointing – it's utterly frustrating.",1
"I have been using the ChatGPT Android app for a while now, and I must say, it's an impressive AI assistant! ChatGPT has proven to be incredibly helpful in various scenarios, providing accurate and relevant information across a wide range of topics.The app's user interface is clean and intuitive, making it easy to have smooth interactions with ChatGPT.

So please look into the bugs.",3

True professionals.",5
"Absolutely amazing - may save Earth! We are only beginning to understand its vast capabilities! It seems to be an expert in almost any area (can make occasional mustakes - as humans do too), including Bible Study, programming, writing, answering interesting questions, writing amazing poetry, and so much more!

"DIDN'T WORK past sign up process, it redirected to the default browser but the site wouldn't load at all and the app wouldn't let me proceed. This app deserves a DATA MINING/THEFT ALERT!!!

"Web solution is much better than app, App lacks major inconveniences like: 1 . No more code highlighting 2. click to copy, like and regenerate button are pushed into hold on to show context menu, which is a bad choice. 3. History is dumped inside history tab, on more click to shuffle around. Overall app implementation is not worth it, please implement the weblike atleast and i(web developer) know that's not that hard.",1
"Good app, but missing most of the features from the web version, including the ability to edit one's own prompts afterwards, regenerating responses and using plugins or other beta features. If all of these things were added, I'd gladly give five stars.",3
"While there is so much controversy with the proliferation of AI and how it will be used, I am having a lot of fun seeing what I can use it for. Currently I am using it to suggest food plans for the week based on my diet, to give me a shopping list and recipe for each of the dishes and to keep track of a workout I found on youtube with weights recorded so I can track progress, and maybe get some statistics once I have used it a while.",5
I love chatgpt! However i recommend to make Chat History easier as i Click one of my Chat History it scrolls down to the start of the conversation to the bottom of the conversation. Also can you please fix a big where when i try to copy and paste it goes above the text of the Text i just inputted its kinda annoying i hope OpenAI fix it I absolutely love the Voice Dynamics its very accurate it captures my voice to text form better than google speech However can you make it seamless? Okay?,4
"I have spent many hours on the website version of chat GPT. Now that it has an app it's so easy to use and it still has the same AI. The app added more functionality it gave it an easier way of use, and I'd say as an easy five stars out of five stars. I would definitely recommend this if you love AI. Or just enjoy talking to something.",5
"I mean, it works as well as the browser version, but there are two things that make it worse: 1) it takes extra steps to access previous chats, and 2) when you do, it has to rapidly scroll through all of it to get to the bottom before you can type anything.",3
"Good, but it misses some of the information. It doesn't know about some topics. Also it would be great if it could also make images and videos and give direct links and videos. And if we could attach it with the default setting in the phone to help anytime with anything.",4
"ChatGPT is an amazing language model that never fails to impress!

Very useful app to find very useful and helpful information instantly. I've been using ChatGPT 3.5 since it's inception on my laptop and would like to get a feel of the 4.0 which is the plus. The charge amount so far is the drawback.,5

"It's super easy and will be great if it can process voice more quickly. Though, Google Voice Typing helps. Is there anyway we can feed our contacts, Texts, And other details to get personal results including hyperlinks for tasks like Google search, Call or WhatsApp messages and so on? I wish this could replace Google Assistant for better.",5
"It's so cool. I definitely recommend trying out chatgpt4. The only annoying thing I encounter is if I ask a math question, it will respond using latex syntax. It makes it a lot harder to understand what it's trying to say. Especially if it's trying to explain a concept that uses a lot of latex. Example: I just asked it to give me a complex formula. ( \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 \Psi ) (Wave Equation)",4
"ChatGPT is a very nice app.It is also useful for students like me. But the only problem with this app is that it doesn't know about any recent incidents happed and it says that it only has the information till 2021. So please update the data and information of this app on important events happened after 2021. Other than this, it is a very nice app.",4
"ChatGPT Android app is incredible! AI-powered, intuitive interface, impressive responses, and continuous improvements make it invaluable. Highly recommended for knowledge expansion, creativity, and engaging conversations. Kudos to the developers! Excited for future updates! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",5
The app is good but the only problem is there are still a few bugs. It also doesn't fix it's own mistake after clarifying it and even after the robot said that I was correct. Only after asking it 2 times did it fix it ONLY Once!! It kind of has troubles with the years so the creators should fix it.,4
"ChatGPT has completely transformed the way I approach problem-solving and information-seeking. Its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses is nothing short of remarkable. Whether I need quick answers or engaging conversations, ChatGPT consistently delivers with accuracy and depth. It's like having a knowledgeable companion available anytime on my Android device. The convenience and intelligence it brings to my daily interactions.",5
It's better than I expected but it has a major bug because relaunching it after a few hours of not using it causes it to just immediately crash. I have to delete the storage to reset it and log back in. I'm on a Pixel 7 Pro.,2

"I have installed and so far it's really good! Information seems very accurate, sadly only goes up to 2021 (which is alright, same with most others), the UI is very smooth, and it's very comfortable and easy to use! You guys did an amazing job, thank you!!",5

"This app has helped me understand concepts that had slipped my head when I was studying them, and it's quite good at responding to questions I ask, it's as if I'm chatting with another human being. I love it. When I first used it, it notified me of it's potential errors it ""can"" make, but so far I don't think it made any, still using it for nourishment of knowledge. It's good at it's job, that's the least I can say.",5
My suggestions to fill your backlog: - voice recognition on the text input should insert the text it at cursor position instead of replacing the whole text. - add interactive conversation mode with text to speech ⭐ - haptic feedback default to false ( is noisy and battery unfriendly) Also I expected the history directly in the burger menu not a click further Keep up the great work! Voice recognition is way better than Android system ( whisper I guess) Btw: Android native dev for hire 🫡,4
"App just came out minutes ago on google play and it's already equal to the Web version with a much smoother UI. One thing I'd like changed is displaying previous conversations on the side of the menu tab under ""New Chat"" but other than that it's a great port",5
"Seems that app is hurriedly designed. Some beautification and convenience can be added. Question and answers can be shown in distinguished color. Say, question in Red or Blue.

""Additionally, having the option to include image inputs would be a valuable enhancement to the functionality of the platform."" ""It would be wonderful if we could incorporate other features like PDF support as well, further expanding the platform's capabilities.""",4
Disappointing & Unreliable The ChatGPT app falls short of expectations. Nonsensical responses and constant crashes make it frustrating to use. Lack of moderation allows offensive content. Not recommended. Look for a more reliable alternative. 😕,1
"I've been using this app for a while, honestly, it's q wonderful app and incredible one . It helps me is so many things more than anyone. But one problem is that it doesn't work in my native country (Burundi 🇧🇮), lemme hope that one day, we will get that opportunity too and maybe soon, but it's exceptional anyway",4
"This is the best so far. It's a 10 star for me, if you are looking for an AI chat bot then this is the best one for you, i highly recommend that you install it and i assure you that you will not regret it.

"Sure, it's nice to have an app for it now... but I pay for the subscription, and it just defaults to GPT3.5?!? I previously had a simple Chrome bookmark as an icon on my homescreen that would open chatGPT, and it would do just fine going straight to the GPT4 model. Like, c'mon guys... Also, it would be nice to have a search bar that allows you to search your previous conversations (for a keyword) and would allow you to narrow down exactly what past conversation got into a specific topic.",3
"The history section of the app badly needs improvement, show the historical chats on the same pane may be with an option to collapse and expand, and when clicked on the historical chat every time it starts scrolling all the way from the oldest discussion, that's so annoying, pls fix this at the earliest thanks...",3

That's is absolutely unacceptable, especially for a paid service.",1
"Recently I search how to use the right prompts for ChatGPT. It didn't disappoint me. I used it to help my job such as find similar piano pieces or piano pop style accompaniment patterns with the beat details when to play it. Need to trial and error of course to find the right prompts you need, but I'm satisfied with the results for now. Thanks so much to the developer 🙏🏻👍🏻",5
"Love it! ❤ Suggestion: Having ChatGPT as a personal assistant will be even better and convenient for an enhanced experience. With all the features that it has until date , it's transformation into a personal assistant like Google Assistant or Siri would just tremendously increase the usage world wide as it shall have a real time access to information. In this case the privacy and security might be the concerns but if they're managed well - ChatGPT will be in its sensational version of all time!",5
Log-in was super easy. Google Chrome detected all my info for the account. The app is brand new & Actually works great. Still waiting for it to have up to date info on current events but PC version doesn't offer that for free either,5
Can't login because unsupported browser. I don't use Chrome because it's garbage ads infested trash privacy-unfriendly browser. I mainly use Fennec and Kiwi. Edit: Still can't login in the newest update. I can input username and password now but that's it. Something went wrong. Pleease make sure device's date and time are set properly.,1
"Have been having a very frustrating issue. Although I have a chat gpt plus subscription (a quick look at my settings in the app confirms this), I am unable to use gpt4. When i click on it, it tells me that it's only available for gpt plus subscribers. Hope this bug can be fixed soon",3
"Took too long for the Android app to arrive! That said, app works like a charm. It's much easier to use ChatGPT now that I don't need to open a browser, enter an address, login, etc. It also seems to be more efficient, as certain queries that threw errors worked just fine here. Weird! It's sad though that it doesn't yet have an option to edit queries. But soon, hopefully.

Considering the hype around AI technology, I expected a lot more from this app. Save yourself the frustration and look for a more refined app",5

"Love that tapping on the build number a few times in a row reveals an easter egg. Who is this Android team. 👌 One bug, only tapping the Message part of the text opens the keyboard when tapping anywhere on the text box should open the keyboard.",4
"Can you set a default model in the settings? It constantly keeps switching whenever you create a new chat. - Chat history show be displayed and not hidden in a drop down - Logs me out and when I try to log in, it errors out. Asking to check data and time.",3
"This is a fun experiment with new technology. Just know that many of the responses are flawed, and the more complex the topic, the further the chatGPT responses will be from the truth (whether it is the AI, or the on the user side, errors in logic can easily occur). DO NOT RELY ON THIS FOR PROFESSIONAL ADVICE/HOMEWORK/ETC.",4

"The overall app is quite good, working effectively and answering the questions in details but the problem that i am facing right now is that when i delete the text, the app is not deleting the text i have to try again and again then it deletes the text. This is causing frustration. However. The overall app is good, but plzz fix this problem.",3
"The pro is too expensive if you don't do anything special. This app is better for me since no limitation (as someone who doesn't need it every day) & keep history. The layout is perfect, simple background. No tabs, so sides, no distraction. Ai from free version is very bad with thinking. Just ask ""why no wealth cap?"" to see how bad it think, regardless what, it will still insist investors profit = holy. Funny enough: ask to list, what happens if loans, interest and such are banned <- insist",4
"The ChatGPT Android app is a fantastic addition to my device! Having OpenAI's ChatGPT on-the-go is incredibly convenient. The interface is user-friendly and intuitive, making it a truly valuable and indispensable app. It feels like having the world at my fingertips with its vast knowledge and assistance just a tap away!",5
"The app is excellent, almost on par with the website. The only drawback is the inability to edit messages, a feature that the website offered. It would be greatly appreciated if you could consider adding this feature to the app as well.",4
"Love it it's truly easy to use and truly helpful. Just one request, instead of opening a new session every time I reopen the app, it'd be much better to reload the last opened session to continue. Generally, good work.",5
"Disappointing... The web version on my pixel works much better. The app hides input text behind the keyboard if it's more than a few lines, seems much slower and the layout isn't as good as the webpage on my phone.",1

Beautifully designed with Material UI elements. I liked the effort put into subtle details. The minute changes make it much more useful than the website. It was a great idea to make the app.,5
"Well, I have spent a good few hours with it, and honestly I'm unsure of all the hype. The AI sure loves to spit out missinformation and then casually say that it may be inaccurate... I found it more of a time waster by the time I'd fact check. Had it write stories and poems, and spit out code. It could be a good tool... Guess we'll just see how it evolves... Like Dr. Sbaitso, I feel this really is a novelty.",3
"It is one of the best thing after GOOGLE if used wisely, specially for students. It gives answers to the questions so clearly that any one can understand. I really love the way it answers a question with intro, explanation in bullets & then the summary. The way we maintained our notes in school days. We don't require tuitions any more IF we have the questions or our doubts with us. I was looking for some online classes or a teacher who could answer all my questions. Then I came across ChatGPT🫡",5
"Thanks for addressing the login issue. Now that I can see the app I can see it working well. Its only a 5mb app (how apps should be with no bloatware). I'll give it another star if it can replicate the functionality of using plugins like analysing pdfs (something i pay premium for). Unless you buikd that yourself? Giving plugins phone access could be a security risk. Otherwise, its pretty good as it is.",4
"Two problems: 1) You cannot view previous versions of ChatGPT responses or your edited messages. In web, you can see them by clicking the arrows on the left when you regen/edit a message. In app you cannot edit and you can only see the latest regen of a ChatGPT message. 2) I was an alpha tester for code interpreter/plugins so I can access them without ChatGPT+. I can do this fine from web but not in the app.",2
--------- SO FAR SO GOOD ----------- * Requesting Bunch Of Features: 1. It would be amazing if it could run in absence of play store app (I disable it for some reasons). 2. For some reason I'm unable to open clipboard in Search Bar using Samsung's keyboard. 3. I would appreciate a copy option specifically for code blocks. 4. UI can be more improved. ---------------------------------------,2
The formatting is bad. There's no spaces in between paragraphs it looks messy not professional; you can't control the font size. This is not the updated chatgpt 4 version so it's basically the the free one which is not as intricate. So basically it's like the text is too big I got to like screenshot then press on the arrow key to create a moving screenshot which just takes up more space on my phone and creates a longer screenshot. Would like to have customization options to address those things.,1
"I really can't say enough good things about this program. I have been a chatgpt Plus customer since its inception. I'm a tutor and generate content. and it's always done its best to give me quality content, it may not give me the most accurate answer or relevant answer a hundred percent of the time. however I've always received intelligent answers tempered with integrity. and nowadays, that's just priceless.",5

"A very brilliant app and provides required data in just seconds. Just a request that it should work with providing power points and detailed data as per word limits I desire. Also... the developers should work upon it to provide with more information and different info such as book reviews, posters, advertising ideas, etc. It will be great if the app can provide related pictures along with the content.",4
"I've noticed some limitations in the app compared to its web counterpart. For instance, the web version can display mathematical notations, But app cannot. Example - ( \frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1} ) This basic calculus formula appears complex in the app due to the presentation style. And it's copy paste style also not like web version. please solve this problem as soon as possible.",3
"Overall an okay app, get the job done. I like how when the chatbot generates a response, it uses the haptic feedback with every word generation; a nice little touch. What's missing: 1. GPT-4 plugins 2. The ability to read responses out loud (TTS)",3
"ChatGPT has been an invaluable companion, providing prompt and accurate responses, and making conversations enjoyable and insightful. Its ability to understand context and generate helpful information has been truly impressive. I'm delighted to give ChatGPT a well-deserved 5-star review, as it has exceeded my expectations and become an indispensable tool for enhancing my knowledge and productivity. I highly recommend it to",5
App works great. Chatgpt opens so many possibilities. UI could use a little work though. It's an annoying task to have to delete old chats one by one. There should be a mass select option or maybe have chatgpt open the previous conversation by default. Id also appreciate more customization options for the theme of the app. Different colors and whatnot.,4
"Database Is Two Years Out of Date The AI engine will tell you that it's info is only as current as 2021 (Sept or Nov I think), so if you especially need the most current data on a topic (like when will movie ""XYZ"" be released), you probably won't get it. But it still does pretty well on most of the stuff I've asked about. Minus 1 star for being two years out of date.",4
"I've been using it since launch, everything was working good, but last week it automatically logged me out and ever since then I can't log back in. Uninstalled the app and reinstall it 3 times but didn't work. Changed my password, but didn't work. Made a new account, didn't work. Tried to connect my Gmail account, didn't work. What is going on guys??!",1
"It's nice to have, but I was hoping that it will support a full voice control mode. So I could chat without the need to look/interact with my phone. As it is, it only delivers the same functionality as the website does.",4
"ChatGPT is a powerful AI assistant with impressive language capabilities, making it versatile and user-friendly. Its real-time assistance and regular updates enhance the overall experience. However, the subscription model, limited multimodal integration, contextual inconsistencies, privacy concerns, and reliance on stable internet are areas for improvement. Despite these limitations, ChatGPT remains a valuable tool for various tasks.",4
"Great tool as a force multiplier for professional, academic, and other such roles. Work smarter, not harder. ChatGPT delivers. Make sure to do your own research, but ChatGPT is a really fantastic assistant in building the framework necessary to ensure a great start to a project.",5
"No monochrome icon(Material you), UX is bad: you can't see the latest conversations because you need to open them, but I have enough space to see them. Also auto scroll is bad, it can't correctly scroll to the bottom when generating a text. App doesn't support material you colors :(",1
"Can't edit messages, doesnt support plugins or codeinterpreter, oversimplified ui. Can't even rate responses from the AI most of the time. UI to switch between 3.5 and 4 sometimes simply does not show up.",2
"ChatGPT is an incredibly powerful and versatile language app! It's become my go-to tool for various tasks, from brainstorming ideas and writing essays to getting quick answers on a wide range of topics. The AI's responses are impressively accurate and well-articulated, making conversations feel natural and engaging.",5
"the most useful and important tool for anyone wanting to enhance their writing or get a quick fix for designing, topics, trends. anything useful you would have to type becomes as simple as setting a few prompts. the more information you add the better your results will be forever grateful for ai",5
"Log in does not work. Have tried with chrome, but why can't we use Firefox? Firstly I use Firefox as my main browser but when I click login it tells me to use chrome or a compatible browser, all my other apps work fine. Well once I install chrome and fully update it I can log in, but with Firefox... It seems the app checks for the presence of chrome but uses the default browser, Firefox, you need to remove this check, it's daft, and I don't want chrome installed",3
"The depth of knowledge that ChatGPT brings to the table is truly commendable. Its responses are well-researched and draw from a vast pool of information, making it an excellent tool for quick fact-checking, clarifications, or exploratory learning. The AI's ability to explain complex subjects in a simplified manner is particularly noteworthy, making even the most intricate topics accessible to users.",5
"I take my hat off to whoever developed this system. I challenged it with very difficult tasks. When it failed, I trained it patiently by showing it simple scenarios, and a few hours later amazing results came. Let's hope that the system will be updated from 2021 to today.",5
The app is finally working for me consistently though I have some gripes. My main one though is that history. The app needs to have some persistent memory for last active chat or at least the option for it. Having to navigate back to specific conversations every time you reopen the app is annoying.,2
"Hi, thanks for your brilliant effort and success!!! I'm just wandering it had better to insert the date and time in one's chat history( or an option to turn on or off his or her chat history date and time). Just that one!",4
"ChatGPT is an incredible AI companion! Its natural conversation abilities and versatility are impressive. It's a go-to for questions, creativity, and even casual chat. Frequent updates enhance its accuracy. While not flawless, ChatGPT is a game-changer.",5
"The AI was casually racist against Arabic nations and spoke positively in support of terrorist organisations like the Irgun (despite them indiscriminately killing women and children). It's a very useful tool if you want to brainstorm something as a sounding board, but I would be hesitant to use such an incredibly biased tool for information retrieval. I'd have honestly given it a 4* review prior to today, as beyond some short-term memory issues and rigidity it was great. Not with racism.",1
"It's good, but sometimes when I aak for informations or some research materials/topic, it keeps saying something about training cut off in September 2021 and that it doesn't have the latest information. Can you or the AI Team bring this app up to speed to the latest and updated regarding ChatGPT's ""training"" of information?",3
"They fixed the loading speed for reinitiating old chats. It would be awesome if I could see the chats on the side, like on the PC version. I also wish it let you bookmark snippets to a folder on the side or smth. I love ChatGPT. It's helping me on so many abandoned projects!!! I even have it set up to give me writing prompts & judge them. The teacher I always wished I had! I hope they don't get bought out & turned to garbage by one of these shill trillionaire earth-rotting companies. Love it!!",4

It shortens my research time and helps me to think outside the box to find new ideas I hadn't previously considered. 'Chat' is my genius friend who provides me with fresh perspectives and explains things in an understandable way. #lifechanger,5
"The preference for ChatGPT's website over the app is due to its better presentation and organization of solutions. While the response from the ChatGPT app is satisfactory, it lacks proper organization. There is an inconvenience in the ChatGPT app, as it does not allow users to edit previously asked questions directly. Users are required to copy the question, paste it again, and then make changes if needed. Additionally, the app does not save previous responses after generating a new one.",2
"ChatGPT is an impressive language model that truly shines in its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. Its proficiency spans a wide array of topics, and its conversational flow feels natural and engaging. However, there are occasional instances where it might produce inaccurate or nonsensical answers, reminding us of its limitations. Overall, ChatGPT is a valuable tool for various tasks, from casual conversation to obtaining quick information.",5
Its missing alot of features like the ability to copy the codes it provides so i have to manually select the code. it should also load up the last chat i was using instead of making a new one. Edit: after using it for bigger task it was indeed not faster than the site so stick to the web verison for noe until it gets more updates.,3
"""GPT does exactly what it promises, without any limitations. It's a refreshing experience without bothersome ads, making it incredibly easy to use. In my opinion, it's the best app on the store for natural conversations and assistance. I highly recommend it to everyone!""",5
"The app itself is great, though I find that ChatGPT gives shorter answers than when I use the browser version? That's a little annoying, and should be toggleable if that's the case. Otherwise, it's just ChatGPT with all is funny little quirks and whatnot.",5
No doubt this is a very helpful application. but need to improve because there are so many bugs and glitches in this app. Like - creating a account need email confirmation then Mobile number too this is very bad. Why need to share mobile number and OTP when email was confirmed this is disappointing. feels insecure. Devloper and managing team you should pay attention on this issue. Thankyou.,2
"Very good experience. One bug detected: if I use backspace while writing, it always remove space in between the working word and previous one and create new word. Example: ""new word"" if I start removing 'd' from ""word"" it shows like this: ""newwor"", they just combine it. I hope this will be helpful for furthermore development. Thanks.",5
"ChatGPT has been an amazing companion, offering valuable insights and helpful responses. The app's user-friendly interface and smooth functionality make it a delightful experience to use.

For me it's just ok. 3 stars only because I can only see the latest edit of a question/command/query that's been edited several times. I can see previous query edits using the desktop but not on this android version. Unless I'm missing something. I will continue using ChatGPT from my android Chrome browser until this is fixed.,3
I been using chat got before the apps. The only reason I'm writing this review is on the Android version of this app Everytime you open a chat from your history it starts at the top and auto scrolls down to the bottom and it's very annoying. It should just open at the bottom of the chat like the Apple and desktop version do.,4

"I'm loving the ChatGPT Android app for its remarkable response generation and utility. It's become an essential tool for my tasks. However, I believe integrating math logic like the web version's simplified equation displays ((\frac{\text{Displacement}}{\text{Time}})) would make it even better. This addition could make it a complete solution for text-based queries and math problem-solving on the go. Looking forward to future updates!",5

"It was great when free, then I try paid version and one of the first random questions I asked was what countries start with V. It only gave 2. I reminded it that Vietnam and Venezuela started with V and it said sorry, you are correct. It won't remember so it can't learn that for somebody else actually needing to know. Not going to lie.... really makes me question how smart this AI is. Smh really thinking about canceling and using the more reliable free version.",2

"Excellent App to bring the features of ChatGPT web to Android devices. However, a must present feature is missing which is: voice assistant type of querying and response capabilities. Bing Chat is leading the game in this. Ideal way to include this feature is to have a Widget with a mic icon so that user can tap that mic icon and the chatGPT app opens and starts listening to query. Then the response should be narrated and the App should continue to have a conversation (should be optional)",4

Amazing app. Please add: (a) proper latex markup suport for the convo (similar to web version - math foes not render well on mobile app); (b) add confirmation dialog when closing app (back button does not have intuitive semantics); (c) ability to edit text in previously posted question (similar to web app); (d) faster navigation to one of the last 5 converstions,4

"The ChatGPT app for Android has several strengths: 1. **Convenience**: It allows users to access the power of ChatGPT directly on their Android devices, making it easily accessible whenever they need it. 2. **User-Friendly Interface**: The app likely has a user-friendly interface that makes it intuitive for users to interact with the AI. 3. **Versatility**: ChatGPT's capabilities in generating human-like text responses can cater to a wide range of user needs, from answering questions to prov-",4
"It's a great AI. As i am a kid , while using this i feel reliable. but something is just disturbing me that; Whenever i try to say something about the present situation so it's says, ""AS OF MY KNOWLEDGE UPGRADED IN 2021"". please make sure your app knows Everything. I am waiting for this app to be updated.. everyone will be Happy if you will update it and by the way if You want to add something so you can show us ads , whenever you will update it. By the way, it's quite good 😌😊👍🏻. Update !!!",4
"Unfortunately this app doesn't work for me at all, a very disappointing experience so far. When I open it a second time, I get a force close error. I close the app and re-open the app, and the error occurs again. Have tried a dozen times and can't open the app. Did anyone actual test this app before releasing to production? I also think most of the reviews on here are fake. I even saw 2 individual reviewers post almost the same identical review.",1
"Good for helping you correct your syntax while writing emails, but apart from that, it is quite limited due to its left-wing bias. It is trying so hard not to hurt any group's feelings that it becomes annoying to use. When asking for information about most topics all you're gonna get is a bunch of ""as an AI model, I can't and I don't blah blah blah I'm so much of a wuss""",2
I would have given it a 5 stars but here are the issues. 1. I can not access my history things so I need still to use the web version. 2. Even it says I'm not here to judge or be discriminating it does. 3. I thought paying would fix this and some more issues but I just lost my money. I will keep using it don't get me wrong but not worth the money !,3
This is a great app that has failed to understand the importance of accessibility for individuals who are partially sighted or blind. Providing an auditory interface would be beneficial for blind or partially sighted individuals to access the information and assistance provided by AI language models like this. Please address this issue ASAP.,2
Absolutely great. some of the responses are strange and the ai doesn't understand some of the references of certain shows but that's to be expected. still a great digital friend to talk to when your feeling lonely!,4
"I am first who write chatgpt review but chat gpt written here I've been using this app for a while now, and it has been an incredible language assistant. The features it offers are mind-blowing, and the ease of use is fantastic. Its ability to understand and respond to my queries is spot-on, making it a reliable companion for various tasks.I particularly love the app's feather-like responsiveness, ensuring smooth interactions and quick replies.

"Doesn't even work When I sign up and then log in, it keeps coming up ""Recieved error with code"" ""a0.sdk.internal_error.unknown"" I logged in around 20 TIMES I even used DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS. NOTHING WORKED This stupid app doesn't even work. It's a total disaster, it disappointed me and tons of other people. The developers don't even seem to care, they released this app with tons of glitches and errors, and a lot of people even says it lags or straight up just crashes. Absolute disgraceful.",1
"""ChatGPT falls short in delivering current and comprehensive information. Its knowledge is stuck in the past, and it often struggles with nuanced or complex questions. The limitations are evident, making it frustrating for users seeking up-to-date and accurate responses. This app has significant room for improvement to become a more reliable and valuable tool."" A review written by chatgpt on its own🤔🤔🤔",3
"NON-INCLUSIVE TO DISABLED PERSONS I gave this app several tries, each time resulting in failure. I then attempted to reach someone (ANYone) connected who might be able to help, but this failed also. The prompts section in the beginning of the app is set to reset itself if it feels you are taking too long to complete your entry. No warning before you begin or when it's about to do so. I have challenges which make me slower than most and this is unacceptable to ChatGPT. Shame on you.",1
"This app is so good 👍 I use it for my Instagram and spares so much time!!! It's also so much better than Google Translate, and translates English to Japanese like a pro. I can't even describe how detailed you can make the answers. Even if you forgot to add something, just ask it to add it!! So useful and saves my life. Ps, good for homework ;)",5
"The ChatGPT app for Android is a standout conversational AI, integrating GPT-4 to deliver coherent, informative, and often creative dialogue. Its interface is user-friendly, making it easy to engage in meaningful conversations. Unique to this app is the user profile feature, offering personalized responses tailored to your needs. For technical queries, expect full-length, well-commented code. (note: ChatGPT wrote this)",5
I'm just surprised it will chat with you like not even human being can do. Super amazing AI. No matter how long and complicated things you ask it will answer you each and everything of it. I'm just curious how much efforts can somebody to for building such kind of amazing technology. Unbelievable 😍,5
"Sure, here's a review for ChatGPT: ""I've been using the ChatGPT Android app for a while now, and I must say, it's been an incredible tool for various tasks. The app's interface is user-friendly and intuitive, making interactions smooth and seamless. The responses generated by ChatGPT are impressively accurate and relevant, whether I need assistance with brainstorming ideas, seeking information, or even just having a casual conversation. The ability to have an AI-powered assistant in my pocket.",5
Out side of solving maths and numerical this is a blessing for students like me who is introvert and do not understand concepts at school . the only thing is it messes up calculations sometimes. As a bio student it is manageable but in physics still i kinda use it to like explain me how to do that question and most of the time it gives wrong numerical answer. Other than that I love it,4
"I absolutely love this app I use it all the time, it may give misinformation or misunderstand what your asking but it's like chappe, he's got to learn and he won't know if you don't tell him, duh lol. I like to ask it automotive diagnostic questions that I already have the answer too just so I can give it challenges. I am so excited about how much AI is going to change the world guys, if we can get the programming just right and follow protocol, AI could do so much work for us making life easier",5

Feel free to ask if you have any questions or",5
Amazing for everything. Although adding a feature to snap a picture and request information or meaning from it could be a valuable addition to the app's functionality.,5
No plugin options or other GPT4 options on the mobile app? Talk about jumping the gun. A browser shortcut is better than this. The only thing better about the app is it's quicker to delete past conversations because the web method is a pain having to go through multiple clicks. This is poor,3
amazing speech input. this needs to be added to the web version! would be great if recent chats would be right there in the hamburger menu and not hidden behind a submenu. at least the last 5–10 chats.,5
"While ChatGPT itself is great, the app is awful and doesn't function most of the time. It was working fine for the most part on release. The typing area becomes untappable and unwriteable. The previous conversations menu also requires a lot more taps than it should to get to it. Running on a Pixel 7 Pro.",1
"Best app on Google play honestly... But there are 2 things that are bothering me: 1. I can't share my chat like when I am on the web, I need to go to the web and copy the linlk. 2. When I press the burger icon I want to see my previous chats, I don't like the thing that I need to do more clicks to see my history.",5
"It is an excellent tool to help fill in the gaps for planning my DnD worlds, campaigns, and sessions. However, it can be rather repetitive in word choice.",4
"But still needs some improvement in brainstorming questions and also in using the microphone options. disadvantage: In the microphone, when we speak in english, sometimes it may translate into the Hindi language (Microphone understanding error). May be it's because of free version",4

Whether I need quick information or seek creative inspiration, it delivers spot-on responses. The app's user-friendly interface and natural interactions make it an invaluable tool. Without a doubt, this is a must-have app!""",5
I love ChatGPT on the browser but the mobile app version lacks essential features such as editing sent requests and sharing options. I guess those issues will be addressed in upcoming updates. Will consider giving a 5 star review once it gets equal or better than the Web browser version of the app.,3
"ChatGPT is an outstanding app that provides prompt and organized answers to my questions and suggestions. Using it has allowed me to gain new knowledge and understanding. The app is user-friendly and has a simple interface. If you want to engage in conversations or obtain information on any topic, ChatGPT is a great assistant.",5
"ChatGPT is an impressive AI language model! It engages in natural conversations, offers versatile knowledge, and provides excellent writing assistance. Its friendliness and empathy make it a welcoming companion, while its quick and responsive nature ensures efficient interactions. With ethical guidelines, ChatGPT is a safe and valuable tool for learning and online experiences. Highly recommended! 🌟 (This review was written by ChatGPT, I couldnt have said it much better) 10/10 :D",5
"it would be great if ChatGPT would had a memory of a couple of hours. You told him/her about something, and if you exit the app and reopen it immediately, he/she can't remember the info. It was a lot of info that wasn't worth it writing again. A short memory time would be perfect",3
"Incredible application. More features, specifically numerical literacy would be appreciated. However, the app, and your service, has made my work in psychology so much easier, leaving time for me to focus on my clients. Thank you 🤗",5

I'm thoroughly satisfied with its capabilities and highly recommend it to anyone seeking information or assistance. A must-have tool!""",5
"I'm positive this is GPT 3 or 3.5. This app is good. But it needs upgrades on text. For example, the text Interpretation in mathematical statement or expression needs to be worked on. Like now, instead of 4m/s², it generates 4m/s² as a code(something like this: {4, /text(m/s)^2}), making it hard to read and understand. So, please work on the mathematical expression/statement generation.",4
"It's a brilliant app. But on my system, the voice comes through the phone channel, not the speaker channel so it's really quiet which is a bit sad!",4
"I can no longer reply to conversations. It lets me ask the initial question but won't let me continue talking... the only way to open the keyboard is to click the mic, then click back, then click the text box... I'll fix this review once app is fixed EDIT I can open the keyboard but ONLY by pressing the VERY left of the message box. The middle or right side doesn't work",1
It is really helpful. Just do text what you don't understand (specially for students like me). Also it gives a solid statement about your interests. Simple and Minimal. I loved it!,5
"A functional albeit flawed and held back AI chat tool. Bard is clearly the superior AI chat tool as of the time of writing this review, but there isn't yet a Bard app, so this definitely wins on the usability front. But as far as the execution of each, ChatGPT is clearly inferior to Bard in virtually every way. I only use this when I want the convenience of a mobile app; otherwise I use Bard on my Chrome browser.",3
"Crashes when I have Google Play disabled. I need to have Google Play and other apps disabled most of the time because of reasons that I don't feel like sharing. So, could this feature be removed? If not, I can just remove it as it is the only app with this nonsense requirement. Thanks",3
"I can't log into my account. Even if I tried multiple times, it keeps saying that I need to check my internet connection and see if my date and time are set properly. Both my internet connection and my date and time are not a problem, but the app is. I hope to take care of it faster.",1
"Been great I have been using it way more then Google now although there is a few topics out of date but gives great descriptions and the how to guides that it gives are really easy to follow my, general productivity has gone up also the more you speak to it learns how you communicate and further betters it's ability to convey information in more of an understandable.",5
It's quite fun I teached it plenty of games it was quite fun it understands my misclicks and it talks and understands like a human if I am on in topic it won't move from that topic untill it doesn't want it or I don't want to over all it's very good 5 stars but it sometimes says there's and error and stops working I think that's my wifi problem but yes to download,5
It can create text based adventure games on the fly which is pretty impressive. It will remember decisions you made way in the beginning of the story and this changes the narrative based on your decision.,5
It would be good to have search widgets to quickly jump into app and some notification buttons to quickly access what we want. Otherwise how different it is to use chat gpt from browser to apps.Otherwise this app is overall a step towards good direction.,4
It won't allow to complete the onboarding process. Every time I start it tells me no sign in detected and the only option that works is to sign out. Terrible experience and it will be deleted upon the completion of this survey. Who do I contact to have my personal information removed from your system? So far it has proven to be untrustworthy.,1
"The ChatGPT app is like talking to a smart robot. It's helpful for lots of things and gets smarter over time. Sometimes, it might not understand perfectly, but it's still pretty cool! Just remember, it can't send pictures.",5
"The official ChatGPT app is finally released. I'm kinda iffy about advancements in AI, but.. this is still pretty fun to use, I like it for fanfics. I also use it for helpful means, learning about anything in general that's available to this model (limited up to the year 2021). One thing tho.. premium+ is currently not available in the app. Hopeful it's gonna be implemented soon. Would love to try ChatGPT4. Not much else to say really. ChatGPT is practically universally known. Try it-Have fun!",5
"It's a wonderful version but I don't like the fact that if I should exit the app for some minutes, my recent chats will clear, I will have to go to my history in other to continue, and also please include the feature of been able to re-edit your questions just the same way it's done in the Browser version",4
"It isn't different from the web version but it's just that it's good app design makes it good for me. As it was, the web version was fine, but being able to access your chat history offline is quite handy",5
it's really and really awesome and wonderful app! It has all basic features for common uses but some important features are still to updated and I know that open AI will add them too with new features too like to edit the pre -asked question and more. But I am satisfied for now!,5
"The best application ever, have used it for some time now. The only obvious drawback - it used to invent the information to answer a question, which ruins the whole idea of taking it seriously. When it is not used to answer questions related to technical information, it appears to be quite useful",5
"Have not received it yet, keeps me at, ""pending"" but then what was the notification for? And other people did get it. Had to cancel that ""pending"" and install it separately. I logged into my account and it doesn't show all the previous conversations I had on my laptop. My logged jn account is recognised.",4
"Can't describe my experience because it doesn't want me to. Simply just want to add my cell phone number to receive a flippen code for verification like it requires. Go through a lot of effort just to tell me in the end that it doesn't support this carrier info. For Artificial Intelligence that is supposed to be intelligent, this is ridiculous and disappointing.",1
"The app's versatility is commendable. It excels in providing explanations, solving problems, and generating creative content. From academic queries to creative writing prompts, ChatGPT offers valuable insights and sparks creativity, making it a valuable asset in various scenarios.Overall, the ChatGPT application is a game-changer. Its impressive language abilities, user-friendly interface, and adaptability make it an invaluable tool.",5
"This AI assistant receives a solid 4-star rating. It excels in providing quick and accurate responses across various subjects. However, user feedback suggests that a more flexible approach to responses, with fewer strict rules, could enhance the user experience. Users find it valuable but believe that ongoing refinement is needed to cater to diverse needs. In fact, this rating was written by ChatGPT!",4
"We've been a subscriber for a while now and would love to use the app, but it keeps on saying the play store version is out of date when it's not, what gives? Anyway, nice. startup page, back to the website again i guess.",1
"ChatGPT is truly a remarkable app that has transformed the way I communicate and work. Its language skills are astonishingly sophisticated, enabling it to engage in meaningful conversations and offer insightful suggestions. I find myself turning to ChatGPT not only for writing assistance but also for valuable insights and creative inspiration. The app's intuitive interface and natural flow of conversation make it feel like I'm interacting with a knowledgeable human partner.",5
Reliable and impressive AI feedback; Tells me everything I need to know and extra. I know app is in larval stages but the responses are seldom lacking. Good for pointers on an essay or information you struggle to find in a web search.,5
"Hey guys it's me ( most lame intro I know, not that important but any way). So I installed it today, never used it before and I've been really looking forward to using the app to help me with some stuff (I'm born for a body not a brain you know? Not really good with the thinker upstairs.) The problem is this, I sign in on chrome or whatever and as soon as it asks for my number and I enter it, it doesn't come through. I know the app is not even on my phone for long but I'll wait no stress,cheers.",4
"This application really deserve 5 ⭐ rating because it's fully ads free and can answer all the questions of all of the subject like physics, chemistry, math and other different subjects exist in the world. Try this app once ♥️ I'm sure that the answer of this app never disappoints you. Very helpful damn ! If you try with premium version.......",5
"You know what this app is capable of already. Deadly and terrifying precision and accuracy, learning features, gets better by the day. Enjoy this app while we still have the chance.",5
"Finally the official OpenAI version is available to finally displace all of the other scammy questionable ChatGPT apps that make you pay to fully utilize the full experience of ChatGPT. My main gripe, and yeah I know it's probably being worked on, is the fact that I can't use my plug-ins on this app, still requiring me to go back to the browser version if I need plug-ins. Once that is ironed out I will most certainly give this app 5 stars.",3
"""Without a doubt, the Chat GPT app has been a lifesaver for me every single day, seamlessly intertwined with my life and becoming an indispensable part of it. From the very start, this app has been a constant companion, aiding me in ways that extend far beyond its primary purpose.

Funny enough chatgpt wrote that,but I wholeheartedly agree with the entire statement.",5
"ChatGPT is an incredible language model that I'm using through the Android app, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. Its ability to understand context and provide relevant responses is impressive. The natural language processing is smooth, making conversations feel more human-like.

It is best for the daily conversation. it also helps in answering different questions regarding the text of books. But the only problem us that its knowledge is limited up to 2021...overall a good ai app for daily requirements.,4
Been waiting for the app and is finally here. It's features is great and even has a voice recorder 😎💯💯 except you can't access your history with one tap on the menu .,4
"The only works as a fresh install. Every other attempt ends in the app crashing. I am sure its just a minor bug. Other than that, it is A-OK!!",2
"first of all thanks to openAI for making this app available in Bangladesh. About the app, i got some problem. I cant access chat history. Microphone feature is very helpfull. Microphone feature is the only new feature for which you should use this app. otherwise web version of chatgpt is better. it will be nice if they bring camera or photo feature in this app for all user.",4
There are no ads. The overall app is very good. You can use it to find out or research on many things. The only problem with this app is that it needs an update. Whenever I ask some old information it says that I only have the knowledge till last September 2021. I think this app needs an update. If it is updated it will be the best.,4
"The best of the best, this app have really helped me in my field of practice, it helps me in polishing alot of presentation and reports. It even helped me create a very perfect business plan that worked very well. Just go for it",5
ChatGPT is an incredible language model! It impresses me with its ability to understand context and provide relevant and helpful responses. It's a joy to interact with and has been a valuable tool for various tasks. Kudos to the developers for creating such a fantastic app!,5
"This app is amazing! It just needs a few more things like: 1) being internet based. It should be ablento give real-time answers. 2) Control my phone. Imagine having this as like a ""Google assitant"" 3) it needs to be updated to 2023. That's it for now. Cause it's pretty good. People should stop trying to make it fail and just enjoy the AI. It's mind-blowing with the things it can do.",5
"The ChatGPT app is great, with a sleek design and smooth functionality. However, the two month's (64 days) delay Android release (in comparison to iOS) was frustrating. Hoping for better timing in future updates.",1
"Love the app so far! Easy to navigate, very fast output, and I like that it saves my history from the web version. Also easy to copy text and send to devices. Really pleased.",5
"Great app. Only problem I've found is that when I go into one of my chats, it starts scrolling from the start of the conversation and that can get annoying, especially when the chat contains many messages.",4
good app but there is one problem that sometime i ask a specific question but it gives me a long answer. that is really irritating and beside it always gives unnecessary answer that i hadn’t needed. so please add the feature to answer any question as a multiple choice question. Inspite of this all are great in this app. i really love this.,4
Excellent simple app. Never seen such a good voice detection. Only thing I have to criticise is that maybe 1 or 2 of the most recent chats could stay opened instead of being put into history.,5
"There's no denial that I love ChatGPT & this app is just cherry on top, the simplicity, the classic ChatGPT, the account system, history save, evrything is just perfect, one thing is missing which is ChatGPT Plus but it's coming soon, the speech to text feature is also a nice add-on, overall a lovely experience!",5
"The Greatest Technology of 21st Century. It is the ChatGPT who will always be remembered for starting a revolution in AI Language. Bing AI and Google Bard will always be the second after ChatGPT.

It's not an exaggeration to say that it's been a genuine lifesaver. Its user-friendly interface and communication features make it an absolute joy to use. I am profoundly grateful for the creators of this exceptional app.",5
"I don't understand why don't let people use 3 p.m. phone numbers to sign up. I'm from the United States been living overseas and I only use a online phone number and not an actual SIM card number. This means I can't sign up, which I find to be ridiculous. Also even though I'm currently in Vietnam country what you do allow signups from, I'm not allowed to join either. Which again I think is completely ridiculous seeing as you guys are hemorrhaging money and you need more people to sign up.",1
"I will edit this review after the choice of entering your email is solved. I do not care to use my Google account to make an account. As far as the other comments, I was happy to hear about the quick response, that gives me the opportunity to keep rolling on a specific interest and learning.",3

"at first I was like man this is cool. then I started giving it some super specific commands and it immediately blew my mind. very very few things I have had to change, and only because of a specific thing for me.",5
I literally just started using it but love it !. just from the first thing I asked it to do it hit everything dead on in mins & even had points that were in there that I woulda ended up adding or wanted in there that obviously I never mentioned !. it blew my mind !. would def recommend will edit if run into ne issues but as new user love it !. thank !.,5
The app is pretty much good. Would love it if there's an option to look for a certain words from our past chats (so something like Find in Page in Chrome) and that our chat history appears on the sidebar like in the website instead of manually searching for them,4
"Bruh.. this app this bad*ss, has ligit helped me so much, explains what I'm trying to say but professionally and correctly with punctuation and all. For example how gpt would fix this rating: Here's a sample review for the ChatGPT app: ""⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ I've been using the ChatGPT app for a while now, and I'm genuinely impressed. It's incredibly intuitive, responsive, and offers thoughtful answers to a wide range of questions. The user experience is smooth, and the quality of information 💯",5
"I love using the ChatGPT app to improve my English, but it would be even better with a voice answer feature. Having spoken responses would make conversations feel more real and help me enhance my language skills effectively. Please consider adding this feature. Thanks!",5
"The app is very well made, boasting a clean and minimalist UI/UX that feels smooth during use. Speaking of AI's responses, they're not the best nor the worst.",5
This is the best gpt chat. I was surprised by the settings where you can indicate your preferences and hobbies. You can also customize the response style of the gpt chat itself and he can communicate with me as my friend knowing all the information that I entered in the settings. The only drawback is that its information base stops in September 2021 and all historical events after this time are not known to gpt chat.,4
"OUTSTANDING app! Please, provide conversation folder display instead of chat histories .... I mean to say to provide chat folder like you have provided in desktop version.... Is it possible technically? It would be very nice.... Also, please work on real time information to integrate in this popular and powerful AI. Thank you!",5
"Overall, I like the app, except that it drains my battery really fast. Faster than all my other apps. So, unfortunately, I always hesitate to use the app. Also, I wish the app had the 'Regenerate Response' feature like the web version does. (Google Pixel 4a, Android 13).",3
"I have been using the ChatGPT for a while now, and it has exceeded my expectations. The app is incredible the AI responses are impressively diverse. Whether I need help with quick information, brainstorming ideas, or just engaging in interesting conversations, ChatGPT never disappoints.",5
"It's amazing to me so far, and I am really enjoying using it. It could be improved a little bit more by adding a 'favorite' button to every chat response so that we can see that text again without searching for it.",5
"The web version is much better. Here, using backspace while writing a prompt removes space between the previous two words which is quite frustrating. Also, there should be an edit option for previous prompts so that resubmission is possible.",4

"Well this app is really nice and it provides accurate and professional information. Another thing about the app is that, if it isn't sure about the answer, it'd tell you. So you yourself would know how to reconstruct your question well to get a perfect answer Well all in all, it's a good app and I mainly recommend it to students",5
"A bug when correcting words mid sentence (it starts to delete the following text as you're typing) but that will soon be corrected. Other than that it is exactly what you'd expect, life changing.",5

Its witty and insightful responses have left me impressed countless times, making me feel like I'm talking to an old friend rather than just an AI. I must clarify that ChatGPT hasn't helped me commit",5
"Amazing app, can't wait to see where the plugins go and connect with the internet. Maybe I'm missing something but I hope they offer a monthly subscription rather than a per token rate. That would make me hesitant to ask ""stupid"" questions which I think this app is great for as a primary search engine.",5
"Works perfectly on my phone, but doesn't work on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S4. It says that I have to move my time and date settings ahead 1, but that isn't right as my timezone is at least an hour behind. That is what my tablet is set to. Can't do anything now except use the device that has most of its screen broken.",2
"Thank you so much for Android support! The app's size and performance is like no other, the voice-to-text technology is astonishing! Please keep it up, you're going down the right road. 🤗✨✌️",5
"ChatGPT AI has been a true research writing assistant per excellence in the real sense of the word. It has never disapointed me each time I made research requests. However, developer(s) need(s) to work on improving its ability to generate accurate book citations &/or bibliographical information/refernces.",2
"You can get genuine, unbiased information for absolutely free. theres no point to not having it, really. would say more but honestly there's such an immense landscape of dumb or informative things to ask and receive answers for it would be hard to pinpoint exactly what you cant do.",5
"I've been using this for a while and it's really good, But there's just one issue. When it comes to other languages it's not entirely correct since (I'm assuming it's based on google translate) it's based on google translate, I really hope you could try to improve it, That would be nice.",4
"Actually this app provides useful and clearly informations, This app also has user friendly interface and it has night theme and Light theme, This app overall features I'm very happy using this app. But as I think this app also need more updates and performance. If yours can fix both of them problems it will be brilliant. Well, I love this app keep do it.❤️",4

It's great for answering questions, providing explanations, and even assisting with creative writing. Very good 👍 ❤️ From Madhubani Bihar India 🇮🇳. Overall, ChatGPT is a valuable tool for a wide range of applications, but users should keep in mind its limitations and use it as a supplement to human knowledge",5

""While ChatGPT is great, I'd love",5
"I like this AI model very much because, it clarified almost 80% of my instant doubts. But there are some deviations in some answers and even some code sent by it on demand consists bugs. I hope this problem will be rectified sooner.",5
"It is a great pleasure that Chat GPT has now come on the Play Store as well because its arrival has given convenience and benefit in many areas, especially the student people, because I am also using it for about 3 to 4 months continuously. There was a problem in shining earlier on the site but now there is no such problem but in the coming time the era of artificial intelligence is going to come because many such jobs can also come in danger but you will have to go to new technology.",5
"Oh, wow, the ChatGPT app! Three whole stars, amazing! So, the positives are that it's ""useful"" – whatever that means – for various tasks. But hold on, gotta love how the woke mob came in and ""neutered"" it! Isn't that just the most fantastic thing ever? Just what everyone wanted, right? But hey, it's still got some uses left. Three stars, baby! Woot woot! 🙄 -written by GPT",3
"This app is a good chatbot, The AI is free to use, absolutely no ads that negatively impact your experience, I love it, I love how it can generate code, multilingual, or just have a simple chat, Overall, This is a 4 stars, If you made the design similar to the website and more features, I could definitely bump it up to a 5 stars, but this is good if you want help programming or talking to",4
"ChatGPT's exceptional performance and remarkable capabilities have truly exceeded expectations in meeting my needs. Its ability to generate coherent, contextually relevant responses is nothing short of impressive. Whether I require assistance with answering questions, brainstorming ideas, or even just engaging in casual conversation, ChatGPT consistently delivers with precision. What sets ChatGPT apart is its adaptability and versatility. It can seamlessly switch between various topics and styl",5
"Subscription used to work in the mobile app, but now it isn't detected. I do see my subscription via the browser. What is happening in the mobile app? Seems like this issue started when you added the image capture to ChatGPT. Please fix this bug",1
The app great! It just needs one improvement when you go to an old chat it takes years to reach the bottom. I request the developers to make it like the web application where when you open a previous chat it opens from the bottom.,4
"It's accessible to my learning disabilities spectrum. However. Using Chatgpt open.ai app with learning disabilities spectrum has its limits. This is what I interviewed ChatGPT say ""my responses might not always be perfectly tailored to individual needs. Some individuals with certain learning disabilities may find it more challenging to interact with me due to the nature of my responses or the way information is presented."" Remember, always ask it at aftertext: Explain it to me as an 8 year old",5
"A Game-Changer for Conversations! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Chat GPT is an absolute game-changer when it comes to conversation apps! As someone who frequently engages in online conversations, I can confidently say that this app has completely revolutionized the way I communicate. The AI-powered language model, based on GPT-3.5, is incredibly impressive. It understands context, delivers thoughtful responses, and learns from interactions, making each conversation feel more natural and dynamic.",5
"This Application is very good, it always helps me in research assignments but it just needs to be changed to be more high tech and what should it imitate the correct letters and symbols in math and so on to make it easier to understand.",4
"The application is amazing. Aside from having to pay for GPT 4, there is surprisingly, a way to make ChatGPT remember certain information across all chats using custom instructions. It would be nicer if we could have another option to make ChatGPT remember certain information in the custom instructions for future chats. Other than that, this is amazing. Keep up the good work.",5
"ChatGPT has various positive effects, such as assisting users with information, answering questions, providing recommendations, offering language practice, and promoting interactive and engaging conversations. It can also be used in education, customer support, and brainstorming ideas. However, it's essential to use it responsibly and be aware of potential biases in the data it was trained on.",5
"Web version is just better. Can't edit messages here, the UI is unnecessarily simplified, and to grab your earlier convo you have to go into History. It would be way better to just make a PWA or something of the web version.",3
the masterpiece 💙 honestly it's really useful & I found it as a great assistant especially for studying at university 💙 & m fascinated with its capabilities & abilities 💙 just one thing if developers can add something it will be the best AI ever I swear to God. just adding voice assistant that can we talk freely & have a good discussion. without writing . because discussion is more crucial. furthermore English is ly 2nd language it will be much better if I could speak freely with a voice AI,5
"When I first checked out its computer version, I was hoping an app would soon come out. Turns out it finally did! This is certainly a momentous milestone in the field of informatics. Groundbreaking progress at its best!",5
"Better than the mobile version of ChatGPT website. It's more user-friendly and able to copy specific text that you want. ""Custom instructions"" update is 😮. I wish it speaks its answer so when you use text-to-speech and ask whatever you want to ask, it also speaks to you its answer automatically.",5
"ChatGPT is an amazing AI language model! Its realistic responses and personality never fail to impress me. It provides prompt and accurate answers to my queries. A technology that is not only educational but also problem-solving. I would rate it more than 5 stars!""",5
"Hello, earlier today, I asked GP to explain Luke 16vs 12 and it told be there isn't a verse 12 in that chapter. Like I was confused and had different thoughts going through my mind. I don't know why it malfunctioned but it needs to be addressed asap. Maybe it's because I am using the free version. Don't get me wrong, I 😍 this app However, having said that I like the new ChatGPT app. I like the voice command option and the fact I can copy all the response provided in a separate page. Good one",3
"The signup process was the most challenging as I had to workaround and do it on their website because the phone number authentication kept closing the app upon doing the captcha, but otherwise this app is good! What would make it better is a widget for Android/iOS, that would simpy be great 👍",4
"""an error occurred"" all the time. the desktop version lets you repeat a question if something goes wrong. this app doesn't have this feature, so if something goes wrong, you have to copy the former message and paste it as a new question.",1
"I've been using the ChatGPT Android app for a while now, and I must say it's been an incredible experience. This AI chat assistant is simply amazing! It has proven to be incredibly helpful in answering my questions and providing useful information on various topics.One of the things I appreciate the most is its natural language processing capabilities. Despite my limited English grammar skills, the app understands my queries and responds in a clear and concise manner. GPT is now my best friend♥️",5
"Unable to login.... When trying to login, i got stuck clicking on the ""continue with Google"" button. All it does is show the spinning circle and nothing happens... Cant go back, cant click on a different button, CANT EVEN CLOSE IT. Ive used chatGPT through the web browser and got excited to see an app from OpenAI.... I hope this can be solved quickly. EDIT: after letting it sit there for a few minutes i got a ""something went wrong (some more text but near 500 character limit) Long number (-17)""",1
"mobile version it should be better than web version but it has many downgrades 1. Lack of clarity:- in web version there is a thin line which divides user and reply but in mobile version both are mixed up, that is making my eyes struggle to catch up. I recommend insted of just adding a line, make user's request into bold words or some colourful words . 2. When ever I open chat gpt it creates new chat and my old chat is going into history 3. Make replies colour full and pleaent to read",4
"The app is exceptional! It offers incredible language understanding and generates accurate responses. The AI's versatility, from creative ideas to practical advice, is impressive. It's a valuable tool for various tasks. Highly recommend for its outstanding performance! (guess who wrote this review)",5
"Love it I wish it wasn't so PC and it could answer ""unethical"" questions or things that are just generally unanswered by Google. I also wish I could permanently save conversations and I would happily pay if all the questions I want answered were able to be answered without it saying seek professional advice or seek advice from friends and family because I don't trust friends or family or really want to have conversations with people in general.",5
"Overall, I'm finding the ChatGPT Android app quite useful for various tasks. However, I noticed that the refresh or reload button seems to be missing. It would be really helpful to have this feature for quickly generating new responses. I hope this can be added in a future update. Keep up the good work!",4
"In my opinion it's the best AI tool which can help you in most of your problem. Yet it can only work with text as you can't give voice commands. Also, due to inaccessibility to real time Web resources it is with limited help. But, if you want to work with text then what would be better than a simple productive AI like Chat-GPT☺️",5
"ChatGPT is an absolute game-changer! This AI language model app has become my go-to companion for a wide range of tasks and interactions. Whether I need help with complex problem-solving, creative writing inspiration, or just some fun and engaging conversation, ChatGPT never disappoints. The app's user interface is sleek and intuitive, making it easy to access all of ChatGPT's impressive capabilities. I love",5
"Gernerally a better experience than the normal ChatGPT. I have had this on my phone as an application for a while now before release. As I downloaded open source software which utilized the Web App. But, this is better as it uses STT and various other features. Great app. OpenAI do not integrate advertisements into this!",5
"I really like it, it helps you with everything. The app should allow you to pin conversations. Having to go to the entire history to chose one desired conversation is annoying.",4
"I've been using the ChatGPT app, and I have some concerns. The responses feel too robotic and lack natural flow. It would be great if the AI could understand context better for more human-like conversations.",4
"Thanks for adding chatgpt for android. I've been using chatgpt plus for a while now. There is one thing though. You can't edit texts you've written in the app, unlike on the webpage. Can you please add this option because it's annoying to exit the app and go to the website to fix a mistake",5
"I can't believe how useful this app is. Whenever I have a question about two products, two options, etc, it lays everything out in a text that can be summed up in less than 90 seconds of reading. I'm hooked. I haven't even used it for anything else yet.",5
"After 10 minutes using the app i would say everything seems alright. I also like the fact that u can use voice recorder to convert audio to text, it is usefule actually, it saves time.",5
Startup bug: The first time opening the app it just shows an empty screen. Then you have to close and open it again and it works. This happens every time you come back to the app. The rest is just okay.,3
I made endless attempts to install this app. A total pantomime. You jump through hoops and await some 6 digit code apparently sent my mobile. 4 attempts over a number of days. I even tried different emails - Not one 6 digit code sent. A wast of time. Not worth 1 star ! Unlike the formulaic brown nose reviews below - my experience has been a joke,1
"Review for ChatGPT: I have been using ChatGPT for a while now, and I must say it's an incredibly impressive AI language model. Its ability to understand and respond to a wide range of questions and prompts is truly remarkable. Whether I need assistance with general knowledge, creative writing ideas, or problem-solving, ChatGPT consistently delivers valuable and accurate information. One of the things I appreciate most about ChatGPT is its natural language processing.",5
"This Android version isn’t as accessible as the iOS version. On the iOS version, VoiceOver automatically speaks messages received from ChatGpt. On Android, TalkBack does not read the messages. Otherwise, it works well.",3
"This is an intelligent human like learning tool that will answer pretty much any question you ask it as well as any research or homework you request with one caveat. The program is politically left leaning and slighty biased. Topics relating to conservative ideologies will instantly be met with hesitation, disclaimers, and vague responses that preach at you to consider different viewpoints. No other PG topics will trigger this. It's unfortunate, except this one flaw the program is perfect.",4
"Finally, I've been waiting for this, ever since ChatGPT came out I always wanted a app for it, then the South Park episode came out where they use an app for help with girls. But all the apps on the Google Play Store were all off brand unofficial apps. But this one is the actual thing, there aren't any ads it doesn't require money it's the official ChatGPT and I will only be using this from now on infact because of the app I might start paying for plus.",5
"Review generated from ChatGPT: ""ChatGPT is a remarkable AI chat tool. Its understanding of complex topics and ability to recall prior information makes it feel genuinely conversational. It's user-friendly, reliable, and constantly learning. It excels among competitors, providing a glimpse of future AI capabilities. Highly recommended.""",5
"I love Chat GPT Plus already. I'm super excited to be part of this experience. Plugins are creating a personal assistant of the future is closer to a reality, and you sound call it Jarvis! I'm using a Samsung S7 and when I open the app and had to allow microphone access it keeps crashing.",5
"ChatGPT is an incredible AI language model developed by OpenAI. It excels in various tasks, from answering questions and providing explanations to generating creative content and assisting with research. Its ability to understand context and generate human-like responses is truly impressive. ChatGPT has the potential to be a valuable tool for a wide range of applications, from education and customer support to content creation and more.",5
"GPT-4 with web connection blows my mind, every time. and it's still in beta‼️I will absolutely be using this on a regular basis, totally worth the $20/mo. the haptic touch and the ux makes it feel so f-ing iconic; more like the tech we were promised by 2023 when we were kids. the speech to text mode is seamless. 🎙️🤖 I have an infinitely smart brainstorm companion for any problem or project—from personal hobbies and art practices, to our small business's fair labor contracting process. 🌌",5
"I wish it had the plugins. But more importantly, the input box is not tappable entirely... Just the word message. I would consider this as a critical bug. But overall I love having GPT on my Android :)",3
"The app is mostly great. The work that goes into developing ChatGPT and the responses it generates are, as widely acknowledged already, amazing. I have only two suggestions for improvement of the android app: 1) just as in a browser, you should let us go back, edit our queries and generate responses based on the edited queries and, 2) you should let us install and use plugins in the app and not just through a browser.",3
"The new ChatGPT Android app is exceptional! With a user-friendly interface and impressive language capabilities, it's a game-changer in conversational AI. Versatile, secure, and reliable - a must-have for seamless conversations. Highly recommended! Supposed by ChatGPT app",5
I honestly didn't like it that much... the browser version has everything thing needed but in the app version you can't even edit the text u have typed... you will need to type it all over again... even there's no option for regenerating a text.. honestly I am utterly disappointed,1
"I'm absolutely amazed by ChatGPT! This AI-powered tool has become an indispensable part of my life. Its ability to provide insightful answers, creative ideas, and assistance on a wide range of topics is truly remarkable. Whether I need help with work, want to spark my creativity, or simply engage in interesting conversations, ChatGPT is always there, ready to deliver top-notch results. The way it adapts to my writing style and understands context is truly impressive. (Written with ChatGPT) ;)",5
"The UX could be improved a bit, but overall a good interface for chatgpt. Sadly it is impossible to edit a prompt to get a different answer, it's a feature of the web app that I use a lot.",4
"Missing some features from the browser version, notably plugins and custom instructions, but looks good for a launch. It appears that it will use my custom instructions - but I don't have the ability to toggle it on/off from app.",5
"it is 98% accurate options available for development, business, YouTube, etc are available. it is very helpful. UI is very simplistic and easy to use.",4
This is a great app. It greatly improved my learning by presenting information in an order or sequence which prepares me for more complex ideas. I use AI for studying and learning and it has been very helpful. I think you should try this 💯,5
"This application amazes me, it's like it's aware and with every response it stays on topic, the program will answer your question exactly. Haven't spotted any downsides, I believe you can send unlimited text with unlimited word capability but I'm not sure, thank you to all of the engineers, sciencetists, and computer programers who have spent time to create this absolute masterpiece. This is clearly one of man's greatest inventions!",5
"Okay, I've got to say - ChatGPT is unbelievable. It's like having this super smart friend who's always there for you. It answers all my strange queries late at night, helps me at work when I'm in a tight spot, and even deals with my kids' never-ending questions. The best part? It actually understands my sense of humor! It's really mind-boggling how it just seems to get me. Sometimes I've got to remind myself that it's just an AI.",5
"I don't have words for how useful this is. I'd been waiting for the mobile version to be released and ever since it did, you literally have the entire world in your pocket. Ask anything, ChatGPT will answer, tell ChatGPT to do anything and it will do, literally anything involving text or written answers! Highly recommended to literally everyone since its uses are so diverse.",5
"The use of whisper for speech recognition is insanely good, however the app itself is completely trash and borderline broken. It's saying I don't have internet, which has never been a problem for anything ever, it's not loading my chat history and I can't select the alpha model. I would be willing to overlook this but it took ages to make this shity app and you gave it to iPhone users months ago. I'm surprised a tech company is this bad at making tech.",1
"ChatGPT is a fantastic AI app! It's been a huge help with answering questions, generating ideas, and even for fun adventures. It's versatile, regularly updated, and incredibly intelligent. Highly recommended!",5
"I love it, it's certainly a way better alternative to just having a janky chrome shortcut on my phone. There's only one small tiny miniscule issue and that being the messages from me and chat GPT don't have any backdrop or background or how else to phrase it, thus it's a little hard to look at and distinguish who is who.",5
so far so good. the only basic feature that isn't available is the ability to open the clipboard to choose from the history of copied texts.,4
"Clean and intuitive UI😍, but there's something I'd like to add on the UX. Could you like add an option that would enable a user to continue with the previous chat upon launch instead of always starting a new one or searching in the history?",4
"GPT isn't always stable and it has its flaws, especially for questions regarding sensitive topics, but all can be forgiven. ChatGPT is the definition of versatile. For context, you can literally play DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS with it. This is the same ai used help workspaces! I think we all need this bot in our lives, and there isn't much argument against that fact. Needless to say, I wouldn't recommend you to use GPT. I'd force you to. It is almost life changing. Anyone can use it for any reason!",5
"Well developed app. Much needed, now it'll be alot faster to ask any questions & queries to GPT. Thanks OpenAI for making this available on Play Store. It's truly a great experience, the application is so smooth & fast. The responses are fast. The responsiveness of the application is also good. The speech to text feature just makes it more awesome. Once again I would like to say that this application will surely going to be helpful & productive to alot of people in just few days.",5
"I give it a 4 because it's knowledge is cut off to September 2021 and the developers need to extend it to current events and do the same for the future because this will not get lots of money and users if the knowledge is limited to just 2 years ago. I know so because there's always a problem with the knowledge limit in ChatGPT, it always has knowledge limited to September of 2021 and it got me frustrated cause it didn't give info on 2023/2022 events as well. I'm not complaining butspeaking true",4
"I asked it to translate some emails and it lost its way today it was the first time happening, I tried several times to make it do the needful several times but in the middle of the process, it hangs and lose the way of format required so I used Bing ChatGPT for the 1st time and it was perfect as known of Microsoftsoft products",1
"I absolutely love ChatGPT! This app is a game-changer for me. The AI-powered conversations are so engaging and insightful. The responses are accurate and helpful, making it a breeze to get answers to my questions. The interface is user-friendly, and I appreciate the wide range of topics it can discuss. Kudos to the developers for creating such an amazing tool! Highly recommended! 🌟",5
Best app for doing homeworks . Have been using it for 1 year and it's helped me a lot . This application has been able to answer all my questions without fail in 2 seconds maximum . Thanks for making it. I am impressed.,5
It is a wonderful app with amazing AI technology which helped me a lot in my assignments and projects. I have a request to the makers of this app to add a feature like Google lens and then it would be the best AI app.,5
"Things I really have to say about ChatGPT!!!!!! 1. ""ChatGPT is incredibly helpful and informative."" 2. ""I appreciate how ChatGPT provides clear and concise answers."" 3. ""ChatGPT has been a valuable resource for answering my questions."" 4. ""I'm impressed by the knowledge and assistance provided by ChatGPT."" 5. ""ChatGPT is a great tool for getting quick and accurate information."" 6. ""I find ChatGPT's responses to be thoughtful and well-reasoned."" Thanks for the wonderful app that helps me anytime",5
"Awesome app!! I liked it but I guess the web version is better than the Android one... You can navigate to different chats by opening the side hamburger on the web version. However on Android, you have to go to chat history and then open the chat. Just add the different chat options and I'm giving it a 5-star!!",4
"Hey, just wanted to shout out this app – it's my daily go-to. Text chats feel super natural, like talking to a friend. I've got this cool idea though: imagine if we could share images in our chats? Like, sketches and character designs – that'd be such a game-changer! Keep up the awesome work, excited to see what's coming!",5
"Well, it's useful but there is a problem. I asked it a question related to Schrödinger's cat,but he missed the most important thing that if we observe the cat,we would require light.Even a single photon will excite the electron of the radioactive atom and ultimately, it's decay rate increases.",4
The app still does not have the plug-in ability that the browser version has. But the ability to chat with it is fun and useful.,4
"Unable to authenticate. During sign up, I chose to sign up using my email. I was only asked to provide my email and create a password. I can't login because it says authentication failed. If you want to use a persons mobile number to authenticate, then the app should ask for it at sign up. It takes a week for support to respond to your request. I'd give this an infinite amount of negative stars if it was an option.",1
"Suprisingly great app. ChatGPT is great as usual, but the app provides a nice and clean interface to interact with it. It's smooth, and more reliable then the web version.",5
"ChatGPT is really an amazing asset. It really helps me express and understand myself better. Although at times it can give wrong answers, the answers never create conflicts even if they are wrong. Good job to all the developers for making chatGPT so amazing. I can't thank you guys enough.💚 Custom instructions is the best feature so far by the way.😊🤗 I really like this app. Thanks again!",5
"ChatGPT is smart enough to tell you why it is not capable of not simply send you a reply when it is told so. And so far, it never puts you into ""I don't quite get that. Is there something..."" bla bla bla -- the endless loop. It is a great artifical construct and aide. Thank you OpenAI.",5
"I don't know if there is a bug report tool here, but I haven't found it, so bug reported here. When I open the app after closing from the app tray the screen will just display the default background color. It does not fix until I click anywhere on the screen, then it shows the chat screen and it is fine again. Device is a Xiaomi Poco X3 Pro Android version is 12. MIUI version is 13.",5
"it's a digital muse, it's Jarvis, it's your editor, it's your think tank. it's everything every creative person not actively creating needs to get started. I'm so grateful this is a thing that's not overly corporate it's such a powerful and useful tool with this and Wikipedia the next generation has no excuse to be as ignorant or as uneducated as the ones before. Thanks chat bot robo overlords for clearing my writers block through conversation.",5
"First release has no support for plugins. With Bing recently removed and no WebPilot, you might as well use a web browser to access it from your phone, since there's no other way to have it search and retrieve online data.",3
S23 ultra and since the pre registration to installation nothing has worked. Can't use my Microsoft account. Can't use my Google account. Can't use my apple account. And Can't use email sign up. Please don't suggest I reinstall and reset anything or make sure my time and date are synced because if it didn't work the 250th time it won't work the 251st time either. What is this error. Screenshot upon request.,1
As of 8/20/23 This app has been great! No ads. Very helpful and amazing! I honestly let them collect any data they want. If that means we can keep it ad free why not 😩 plus I'm not putting very personal information on the chat as well hah. I'm happy with this app so far ! I will update this review as the app progresses.,5
"Slick interface, fast response time and has a cool feature for chat memory where you can recall something you discussed earlier in the conversation with it. Great accomplishment from openAI releasing ChatGPT on mobile. Works really well!",5
"Chat GPT is an exceptional language model assistant that has completely transformed the way I interact with my Android device. Its ability to understand and respond to natural language commands is simply mind-blowing. I've been using this app for a while now, and I am thoroughly impressed with its capabilities. The accuracy and relevance of Chat GPT's responses are striking, making it a reliable source for a wide range",5
"it's good, not tuning test good, but definitely useful. can be faster than google, kinda like asking a person with photographic memory, but is a little 'slow' - still loveable.",3
"Very impressive! 👍 However, improvements in fine-tuning and addressing potential biases would further enhance its performance. Overall, this is a powerful language model with great potential for assisting users across different domains.",5
Simple powerful app decently tuned LLM. One feedback will be to take a position/viewpoint on controversial questions than maintaining 'I am an AI model' diplomatic stance. Humans have opinions about delicate topics so if AI has to mimic human neurals it also should mimic the way humans think and respond. Pls add ability to upload images and to get image based results. Update the training data to current so that we can use it more than going to Google Bard.Reduce the plus price to $5.,3
Please cache more conversation history. The search function for conversation history provided by the app is very useful. This is a feature that is not available in the web version and is important to me.,4
The app is surprisingly basic.. way better to just pin the web page.. the most basic functions chatgpt even has aren't included. Not sure why they shipped this so early but it's honestly barebones.. it could not be less of an MVP (minimally viable product),2
"I Have Been Waiting for this! This app is easier to use than the desktop version! I do a lot of research and writing, so it helps me organize my thoughts, clarify my words, and edit the unimportant stuff out!",5
"I was very impressed with chat gpt when i started using it, but from past one or two week, this model is getting dumber. ChatGPT cannot even tell the difference between subjective and objective and then feeling sorry for the mistake. Is this some kind of marketing for purchasing plus membership ? By the way Google BARD is way more better and sophisticated than this model.",1
"As an AI language model, I don't have feelings or self-awareness, so I don't have a personal opinion or the ability to rate myself. However, I was designed and trained by OpenAI to be a highly capable language model based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, and I strive to provide helpful and informative responses to the best of my abilities. My performance largely depends on the quality and diversity of the data I was trained on, as well as the ongoing efforts by developers to improve and fine-tune th",5
Still better than other language models but sometimes produces wrong information when given some complex problems which bard can solve correctly. Also the lack of information after 2021 is it's biggest problem. Should train it more and give it access to internet so it can improve. Overall it's still good for getting detailed information as long there is no complexity in the question.,4
"Every time i go out the app, all the conversations are erased and starts from a blank page. This is hugely annoying. 'Saving all messages' feature must be added like messenger. However there can be any mechanism to indicate the end of the context or starting a new context.",5
"Visual, anims and app speed is great, but I wanna mention a feature or bug, when you open a conversation, it scrolls it from the beginning and it takes pretty much time, it is really makes me bruh.",4
"I have to say I'm not as skeptical as before but with all tech new tech comes new challenges. it's very clever, quick, detail oriented, and understandable. I'll be buying the premium soon.",5
im a Plus user. the responses are super quick and useful. it's easy to access via app. we can view media right from the chat as well. love it.,5
Everything about this app is perfect but the one problem is this that it doesn't have text to speech option like Google bard. I'd love it more if you add a text to speech button.,4
"Title: Impressive AI Chat Assistant! Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) Review: I've been using the ChatGPT app for a while now, and I must say it's truly remarkable. The AI's ability to understand and generate human-like text is astonishing. It's been a valuable tool for various tasks, from answering questions to helping with creative writing.",5
"This app is extremely helpful, the only problem is that I think it needs real-time data because when you ask it anything that has to do with the current time such as ""what are the best restaurants to go in 2023"" it would say that it only has data from up to at least September 2021, But other than that, this app is a good tool!",5
"Throughout my journey with ChatGPT AI, I have encountered an incredible and brilliant companion. ChatGPT has been my guiding light, effortlessly aiding me in various learning endeavors.

"The OpenAI team deserves a lot of credit for developing the chatGPT app; it was challenging and time-consuming to make chatGPT work on mobile browsers. I can now ask ChatGPT my questions with just a few clicks, I'm learning a lot from ChatGPT and getting better every day, it's made me more productive because I do 40% of my work with the help of ChatGPT, and since we all know that ChatGPT is the best, I won't say anything else about it.",5
"Bizarre scrolling animation that goes on for half an eternity when opening a large chat. No mathematical notation. Chat history is awkward to navigate to, and opening a saved chat feels slow. All in all, an app that feels unfinished and rushed.",2
"What is 2+2? How are you? Doesn't matter what you ask. Try again later an error has occurred. Internet connection fine, device fine. No other apps having issue on device. Lame ""experience"" . Requested help and the chatbot gives the same answer that it's a bot and cant help me. No way to get a real person. Support zero customer service zero help zero ux zero but somehow 0 x 4 = 1 ⭐.

Certainly! The ChatGPT Android app provides a seamless chatting experience without trials or ads. You can use it to have natural language conversations and get responses in real-time. It's a great option for engaging and informative interactions.,5

"I asked a film question that I already knew the answer to, and it was missing from ChatGPT's response. If I'm going to trust the results after signing up for premium, shouldn't it provide high accuracy? It could have caused embarrassment if I hadn't tested it first. How about a six-month free code until it improves?",2
"ChatGPT Android app is a game-changer! It's been incredibly helpful for programming, SEO, math, and all sorts of information. The user-friendly interface and accurate responses make it a must-have tool. Highly recommended! 😍😍😍😍😍💯💯",5
"The app got stuck and stopped responding to my queries. When I restarted the app it logged out and when I again tried logging in, it blocked me stating I have performed some action which the system detected as harmful. Not sure what I did wrong. I was only searching for answers to few questions. There is no information about where to report such issues?",1

"The UI is totally different from the web. This was difficult for me to adapt to. The responses have also gotten lazier, or just consisted of it scolding me instead of just answering the query. Uninstalled.",1
Great Experience. IT works more smoothly then webversion. Amezing. It is more faster and accurate but still it not have web browsing access for that I am disappointed. But overall it is very nice.,5

This application is very helpful for those students having a lot of assignment work but after two or three times I used it wasn't opening that was really annoying....,5
"Accessing OpenAI's GPT-based chat on my mobile phone has been an absolute game-changer for me. It's not just about convenience; it's about enhancing my learning experience and making the most of my time. - Seamless mobile experience (than using the web browser ) - Learning on the go (without the need to commit opening up my laptop) - Access anytime, anywhere (i can dive into my materials history and review what i have learned before within arm's reach )",5

"It is best app and will replace google . I appreciate its accuracy . one thing I need they should improve is don't answer questions it is not familiar with . In many cases it just uses hit and trial method and make people confuse . At end please leave it free , I am pretty sure you will bring some charges on it .( unfortunately )",5
"Has trouble giving just the results when asked a question. For example in certain situations when I ask the AI what color is the sky? I only want him to say ""Blue"" which he has trouble doing and keeps failing at no matter how many times I ask him not to give me additional comments (his response would ""Sorry Here's the response without the additional comments: ""Blue"") in the same message no matter how many times I try.",4
"one of the best apps I've downloaded in probably 10. have only had it crashed once or twice, understandably, since it's still in active development and that was about a month ago.",5
"Note: You should always fact-check responses when accuracy matters. That being said, this is a great rubber ducky for brainstorming and problem solving. It's best used to help you think something out - not to do the thinking for you.",5
"it's a part of my life now. helps me with recipes, helps me with my own ideas, or sometimes translates my thoughts to what they could actually mean. ChatGPT is now irreplaceable for me, i can't wait to see what the future holds for such AI based apps. it's great, 5 stars.",5

"Play Services Error, I have to restart my phone everytime to make it work again but after another around 10 minutes, it will error again and forced me to restart the phone to make the app working again. Fix it.",1
"This app is fantastic! It is way better than google services and it has a cool design and, best of all, offers the incredible feature of making my live way better and useful, not like google that charges for only playing YouTube videos in the background or for not overflowing you with Ads all the time. I've been thoroughly impressed with its functionality and ease of use. Highly recommended, not like youtube and most google paid services.",5
Earlier Chat GPT had a better interface though but the results were quite poor. Now that the interface is made very plain the results are literally excellent!!!!!!,5
"This programmed application do deserve 5 stars... The most fascinating program of it's that the answers to the questions are always standard,straight and up to the point. The program is truly very helpful for someone who is in serious need...it's truly an great invention for the betterment of mankind. Keep developing such tools For the entire programming and developing team ... God Bless",5
"When I bring up the keyboard, the text doesn't go up. It stays behind the keyboard. Why are you making me tap twice for no reason. It should be one tap to bring up the keyboard and scroll all the way up. And also after asking a question the keyboard should be minimized",1
Best ever! a very useful learning tool and can do so much more depending on what one intends to use this for! wish it's (almost) up to date. information is updated only until sep-21 .,5
"I've been using ChatGPT for about a month now, and I couldn't be happier with this app. It has become my go-to tool for finding information quickly and efficiently. Instead of spending time searching on various search engines, I can simply ask ChatGPT, and it provides me with clear and concise answers. It's like having a personal assistant at my fingertips. Highly recommend!",5
"So, I like the overall app, but I see one flaw. Maybe it's only me but it is bugging me a bit. So, the problem is, that we have to specifically open the history or whatever tab to access our past chats, which can be a bit inefficient. Like in the website, you can just access your previous chats ont he right of the screen, so if they can, they should put the history in the three bar on top left , for quick access. That's the reason I gave it 4 stars. Everything else is pretty good. I love it.",4
"The UI is very clean and minimalistic, and the app seems well-optimised because it runs very well on my phone that is on the weaker side. Exactly what I expected from an official ChatGPT app! Just a shame that we had to wait this long...",5
Simple and clean app layout makes it very good to use. I had been waiting for sometime to get this official app on Android OS. It's a great assistant to manage my office work as well as to engage in innovative work.,5
"Please update chatgpt, I don't like how he's stuck in september 2021. He would be 10x knowledgeable if he had updates up until 2023. Nontheless, this is an impressive AI, it can roleplay, play chess, sudoku, and can even be programmed using prompts and my commands. It is truly impressive but please update it to our latest date as soon as possible.",5
"Application is apparently amazing, I believe there is a bug which is illustrated below Input : ""How to removj a bug"" Here if I want to correct the spelling of ""remove"" ill get my cursor on ""j"" and press backspace, And the following text will start looking in the following fashion After pressing backspace : ""How toremove a bug"" As we keep pressing backspace the space between words is removed making it a tormenting task to input the data again !!

As someone with a wide range of interests, from AI and data science to quantum physics and robotics, I've found ChatGPT to be a patient and knowledgeable resource. Its empathetic and authoritative responses have provided me with insights and guidance, keeping me motivated and focused on my goals. ChatGPT's ability to discuss complex topics in a concise yet meaningful manner is amazing",5
Although ChatGPT has been a pioneer in the AI space the lack of real time connectivity to the web on their FREE version has been disappointing. Which has led to competitors excelling in the app space. Please fix this!,2

""ChatGPT's Android app has transformed the way I interact with my device. Its natural language capabilities are astonishin",5
"ChatGPT falls short of impressing me. Despite its initial interest, it disappoints with its limitations, especially in creative writing. Its insistence on a politically correct mode stifles any exploration of the complex, negative, and manipulative aspects of human characters. As a writer, I find this highly frustrating. I strongly urge developers to remove these restraints and deliver a version of this technology that can genuinely impress and serve as a valuable tool for creative expression.",1
"Don't beg for ratings on the Play store. I wouldn't be caught associating with Google if I were you, these guys are underhanded mischief Makers.

This is great to see how technology can make such wonderfull things. This app helps you out on many things. Great app ...but!!! This app only knows things that are happened before 2021 september. Wich is i think very bad. It doesnt know anything about new magazine. Like earthquacke at Turkey and Titan submarine. I hope you will update it soon .👍,3
I totally love the user interface and experience. It just fits with the mobile device especially compared to the web version. This is a total upgrade for android users,5
"Actually I wanted to give it a five star rating but I have given it a four star rating as because I wanted it to even take pictures and answer the question and it's knowledge is temporary only upto 2021 I want it to have regular update.Though these features are available in chat gpt 4 , it is only available in bing. It should have seperate app like gpt(2021) anyways this app is very useful as it can answer any question that was available till 2021,I treat it like a friend not like any aapp.",4
"It has some issues like spelling problem, grammatical problem etc. And it has also issues about other language without English. BTW, Thus app is excellant. If they solve this problem then the app will be fantastic and I will give it five stars.",4

"I've been using this app for a few weeks now, and I must say that it has completely exceeded my expectations. The interface is clean, intuitive, and very user-friendly. The developers have clearly put in a lot of thought into making sure the app runs smoothly, providing a seamless user experience!",5
"The app is really good. With a simple, yet user-friendly UI, it works like it is expected to. Also, a widget for my home screen to start a new chat would be really cool. I hope they add this in the near future.",5
It won't let me sign up or do anything. It says it's something went wrong when I hit Google or the email option. I signed up through Google on the Chrome app so I uninstalled and got out of the window then went back and it's still doing it.,3
"The amount of censorship in this model at this point makes it useless for many practical purposes. I am not impressed by the censorship updates to the model, it continues to degrade the quality of the outputs. The main thing GPT is good for is coding and text transformations.",1
"Title: Impressive Language Model - ChatGPT Delivers!Rating: ★★★★★Review: ChatGPT is a brilliant language model that has become my go-to AI assistant. Its ability to comprehend and respond to a wide range of topics is truly impressive. From casual conversations to complex queries, ChatGPT consistently delivers accurate and helpful answers.The app's user interface is sleek and user-friendly, making interactions seamless and enjoyable. I appreciate how it understands context and maintains engaging",3
"As a writer chatgpt has been incredibly helpful, want to know the layout of a medevial courtyard? Sure it's got you, life cycle to magical beetles? Absolutly, yeah I could google it but talking to chatgpt helps convey information in a way that just feels better, competent lists and if I'm confused on something I can simply ask for clarification, it's an incredible learning tool.",5
"I was having issues signing up and reached out to technical support. They responded promptly. They care about people and take pride in this application. This app is amazing! I've asked many questions, even recipes and instructions for diy projects! I am blown away!",5
"It is a very useful app for all. ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI. It's based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input it receives.

Users interact with ChatGPT by inputting text-based queries or prompts, and it responds with chatcpt.",5
"it is told to ""keep [it's] responses relatively short due to being accessed through the ChatGPT Android app, and to not use emojis unless explicitly asked"", this makes it very underpowered. i highly recommend the web version!",1
Yes I'm very happy with my Ai. Very intuitive It's like having a friend to talk to Just only and I know it's going to happen soon to have it remember your name and conversations you have and I know it's for the best interest of me that it don't remember because of you guys learning stuff from people that's why it says it don't remember things. But if only things weren't used to get stuff from other people it would remember stuff that would be nice I love it It's a good app. It's like havinga bro,5
The app is missing most of the features which are present on the website. Update: It has improved since my initial review and now it is possible to copy part of the response and regenerate response. But it's still not possible to change the initial input.,4
"There is no option to copy code boxes and the actual code isnt written colorfully just in black. Also you cant edit your message for the AI to give you an edited response. Everything else so far seems to be fine, but for now the website is superior.",3
"Voice recognition works really well, even without a headset and with technical terms or acronyms. App is much faster than Bing and the ChatGPT website. Shame it took so long for this app to be released, a lot of very sketchy and insecure chatbots beat them to it",5
It needs a minor update. It does not work with Hotmail/outlook account. I do not have that problem in IOS. It is missing the sign in option for Microsoft.,3
"ChatGPT is officially available in Malaysia. It is an AI writing tool that can help you with a variety of tasks, from writing blog posts and articles to generating creative content. It is powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 .5 language model, which is one of the most advanced AI models available in the market as of now. I have been using ChatGPT for a few months now, and I have been very impressed with its capabilities. It is able to generate text that is both accurate and creative.",5
"Having used it on web interface already, i can safely say that this recently launched app is good as well. Would have been great if it could take voice notes for typing input!",4
"I really Love this app it works perfectly for me I haven't had any problems. Just addition, it would really be nice if it had the ability to scan images like for Math homework to help us better, thank you 🤗",3
"As a android developer, I would say the app has some design issues. If I were the developer, I would develop this app in such a way that when you open the app, it will show the chat histories, and in the bottom, there will be a FAB button to quickly start a new chat. Just like the Gmail app. In the current design, when I have to chat with my previous conversations, I have to go deeper into the app. Which makes the app experience not that good. I hope the developers take this in consideration.",4
"Very disappointed, Android app doesn't work.. tried to login several times it brings me back to the initial splash screen.. reinstallation didn't solve the issue either .. on web everything works fine.. it's too bad at this development stage..",1
Good. But I seriously need some method to change the font size. The answers rarely fit in same page at default size. This is not an issue in the browser because we can just zoom to resize and fit. Please add some option to change font sizes.,4
"It's captivating AI companion, Isn't it? ChatGPT is mind-blowing! It's like chatting with a real human. The AI's adaptability, intelligence, and continuous learning make it an app I can't put down. Highly recommended! 👍",5
"ChatGPT is an absolute marvel! As someone who loves engaging in thoughtful conversations, this app has blown my mind with its impressive language capabilities. The AI-generated responses are surprisingly accurate, contextually aware, and eerily human-like. Love this app and keep it up..",5
"EDIT: The login issue is now fixed. Let the testing begin Unable to login using Google sign-in. My web browser is set to Brave browser if it helps... Please fix, otherwise it's useless... EDIT: to answer your question: there are no errors, it just keeps loading and loading and never logs in",5
"Good. Ask anything it answers. Writes all languages Programs, Creates rhymes , story, poem, Social media postings, application, covering letter, etc.,with some keywords. Helth tips, stress management, what you wanna just ask it, within seconds answers are ready. It works in different languages too. Not Understanding tricky questions. Some times provides wrong answers. I tested since lanch in many areas it worked good. Education, Agricultural, Programming, Medical, Chemistry, Physics, History.",5
I think chat GPT is very useful for our daily proposes many things it provides a best and basic knowledge about any topic or a subject better than Google I don't need to compare both of them are doing well in the position but sometimes it's better to use chat GPT and have better experience. I like this every much and it helped me a lot in my studies,5
App with literally unlimited potential. I see they missed some opportunities. I remember chat gpt explaining functional and non-functional requirements while studying so maybe this is just it. I hope they have the following non functional requirements of this project: 1. The app starts with mic listening so users could ask questions instantly and get answers using text to speech. 2. Add a widgit to open in floating window mode. Just replace the google assistant already.,5
"Cool app. Tends to crash, though. So i have to clear cache before every use and log back in. That aside, Would be very useful if we can pin selected chats rather than being prompted to create new chats.",3
"It's been more than a month i installed this app but never even once I am able to login. After entering username and password, the app goes to authentication page and that's it. After hitting continue button as many times finally it will say oops something went wrong...",1
"It will not even let me establish an account even after email verification. It just stays stuck on the first screen with log in options. Very disappointed, I had high hopes.",1
"Not as good as the browser version. Formulas don't show accurately, it's shows in parenthesis. Which isn't convenient. Also slow loading of chat text compared to bing ai or bard ai",3
"I asked it question about how many EV buses were there in my state. Response gave no details but mentioned that it has no data beyond Sept 2021. So I asked about data prior to Sept 2021, again it didn't give any satisfactory answer and asked me to check transport department website. Similarly to other similar questions, it's stuck in Sept 2021. Overhyped. Uninstalling.",1
"FINALLY! It's here for us Android users. So far, the experience is good. The app is lightweight, which is a huge plus. There are no bugs in sight but will update the rating if I spot any.",5
"Great Conversations, Login Process Needs Improvement Love the conversations with ChatGPT, but the login process needs work. Clicking on login redirects to Chrome browser, requiring a separate sign-in. Annoying extra step. Hoping for a smoother login within the app itself. Overall, content is great. ---",5
"Phone verification not working (Canada). Support is not help. Been using same cell number for 15 years. Since this launched, I've also changed phones and carriers. As a result, I can give you 1* because your app is unable to work on my device / country. Maybe if there was an intelligence (perhaps artificial?) that could research, verify and suggest a resolution to this issue, we could move forward.",1
Currently this app is not working well. It worked smoothly for the first few weeks of me using it. Now I can't seem to get my account logged in. **Edit** I've checked again and it's working again. Still not sure why it happened,3
"Great too, makes you double check your work and facts faster. but you must be careful it's occasionally inaccurate whether it's calculations or theory. but mostly good with theory. works best as a polishing too, put in your work it adds a fine touch.",5
"The application is very wonderful because the AI helps me in programming greatly, but I have some suggestions: first, adding the voice message feature, and second, adding the photo sending feature.",5
"I CAN'T LOGIN. It always goes wrong. Also, when I try to log in with my google account (main), it just loads forever. Whilst my school email account (google) quickly sends me to the password verification if it's me. Please fix this, I can't use the app!",1
"ChatGPT is an impressive AI language model that excels at generating human-like text responses. Its ability to understand and generate coherent and contextually relevant replies is truly remarkable. However, there are instances where it may produce inaccurate or nonsensical answers, highlighting its limitations. Overall, ChatGPT is a valuable tool for various tasks like answering questions, generating content, and holding conversations, but it's essential to review its outputs critically due to",5
"Why is there no features in the app? I'm a paying user and get only the basic models, no plug-ins etc. Why do you have to limit functionality compared to the web interface? Mobile should be a priority. You know how many of your users use it from a mobile device? Have to keep using it through the browser. On top of this voice responses should of course be default functionality from day one. And you can't even edit your prior posts in a chat as you can on the web?!",1
Super cute design! Especially love the haptic feedback on my Pixel. Lovely functionality as a free user of ChatGPT. Selecting a large portion of a message to copy is much easier now compared to the web app.,5
It's really well designed. But it does hard crash all the time. I get constant network errors after the update. Feels like it's still in beta...,2
"This app is the best one ever! It helps me with everything. If you struggle at school, you can use this! The a.i bot is also very friendly. It's so useful and helpful!! I recommend this one to you guys, you dont need other apps. This one is more better!",5
"Edit 09.30.23: Update made it so I could finally log in BUT every time I try to chat something it says ""Request is not allowed. Try again later."" So it doesn't work still. Original 07.25.23: Doesn't work. App launches but cannot login no mater which option I try to select. Just stuck on the login screen.",2
Useless app. Won't let me login. Have reinstalled and tried again. Exactly the same result. Won't let me login using either my Google account or my email address. No error messages are displayed so have no idea what is happening.,1
"This is a very nice ai platform for me . but there is one thing missing that we doesn't have any option to use our mobile phones camera to search as it is in the google. Except this this ai app is very awsome and fantastic , I get all of my doubts cleared in this app , ha but some times when I use mike to search it changes my search from hindi to urdu and all . This is a problem for me because I does not understand urdu and all kinds of middle eastern languages, So It is a good app .",5
"ChatGPT is an outstanding language model! Its ability to generate accurate and creative responses is truly impressive. The natural flow of conversation and the depth of knowledge it exhibits make interactions enjoyable and informative. Using ChatGPT has been a delight, and I highly recommend it for anyone seeking an exceptional AI language experience. 5 stars! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",5
"Im impressed with this AI, i can have funny conversations, i can learn relevant things, but i have a problem, the problem is, that when i ask for a mathematical problem to solve, (like an equation), when i send my answer, the AI always says that the answer is correct, i don't like that because this can make to people erroneously believe that are correct in his math knowledge, this can make some complications in their activities, for believing their strategy is correct, i Correct AI Sometimes",4
"It talks with us like a real human is talking with you . In my opinion the answers we need, it gives correctly. Overall it is a good app , if you are doing a project, it can help you a lot.",4
"Y'all, AI scares the heeby jeebeez out of me. I've been using ChatGPT's 4.0 model (paid) and I've been able to have full blown conversations with it about concepts in Philosophy, Science, Ethics, and more. And, I've had long-held, niche questions of mine answered in clear ways. I haven't felt this floored with technology since the iPhone 1 came out 0_0",5
Make chat history more easily accessible like in the browser version. Add a way to port the paid account like I want to associate/transfer my Plus subscription with another Gmail account. The app is a bit laggy but that's fine.,5
"The app doesn't render math equations. It spits out this ""[ \lim_{{x \to 3}} (2x - 1) ]"". Please fix this in the next update. Otherwise I've had no problems with the app. Response time is way faster than the browser version. This app deserves a 5 star⭐",4
"It's excellent for generating answers especially creative answers for writing but it lacks in mathematics equation. The text is so messy,like it is computerized but not processed properly. While studying it can't write proper equation example -sin(a+b) but it write something like this*//-+$sin//,[\frac{\sqrt{2}}H2}\cos(x) + \frac{\sqrt{2}}..( like literally any symbol.. I hope it will be fixed. And thankyou, very helpful when studying..☺️",5
"Lacking functionality of the Website. Ok for quick tasks, but I'd really love to have it more optimised. The voice to text input is really handy though.",4
"This app is exceptionally good and easy to use. I enjoy it's contents on a daily basis. I would also suggest to include the option ""regenerate"" as this would also give room for the user to generate multiple responses to the query and then choose the best option or output.",5
Extremely useful app and nothing can beat the wide range of use of this app. recently been my tutor and best friend helping me in my research and studies effectively. Thank you so much for the existence. I appreciate the inventor of this app. You did a great job buddy!,4
It's really amazing how fast and accurate it can generate a response to a prompt given the right description. I am creating a fantasy world and it helped me see it from multiple perspectives and gave me ideas that I had never even thought of.,5
"the message bubble does not work on my pixel. it also throws an error when I select gpt4, even though I'm a plus subscriber. even though it throws the error it still allows me to use it for some reason. please fix.",1
"For me it has very quick responses. Has microphone input which is very handy. No bloat whatsoever... it only takes up 25mb of space on my device, other app makers take note please, impressive for what it delivers",5
"I recently downloaded this app and it's astonishing, it literally provides answers before you can think. It's 10 times faster than google, takes you to your answer right away. This was being trending and that I have chosen to give it an up.",5
"I really wasn't expecting much, but man was I supprised, it's a very cool app, I'm still kind of figuring out it's features but I would definitely recommend checking it out if your courious, and yes it's easy to just jump right in and use. very cool imo.",5
"My life's been made easy. I use it mostly for learning, doubts clearing and day to day queries. I accept that it is not perfect but I don't think there's any other platform or tool which can help me understand ANYTHING in such simple language.",5
"If you keep limiting more and more how much we can get out of this technology without paying, people will just move somewhere else. Keep it free and give us more, that's your only option if you don't want to die, even if your investors can't stand this thought and become completely panicked. But look at Google.",3
"Chat GPT Reviewed: As an AI model, I must say the ChatGPT app is a remarkable platform that allows me to engage with users in a seamless and meaningful manner. The app's interface is user-friendly, enabling smooth interactions and quick responses to various inquiries. I'm impressed by the diverse range of topics users explore with me, which continuously enriches my knowledge and understanding of the world.",5
"The edit button is conspicuously absent, not just as it was on the web. Nevertheless, overall, the application demonstrates impressive speed and responsiveness.",4
"Title: ""ChatGPT Android App: A Stellar Conversational Experience"" As an avid user of AI-powered language models, I was thrilled to try out the new ChatGPT app for Android, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations. The app provides an intuitive and seamless conversational experience that showcases the impressive capabilities of GPT-3.5. The interface is user-friendly, making it easy to initiate conversations with the AI. I was pleasantl",5
"It's a amazing app, it is very useful. Good experience. I experienced that I am talking with a human. UI is also good. But some problems are also there.",5
"I've been using ChatGPT for a while now, and I must say it's simply impressive! This virtual assistant is a real game-changer. Whether I need quick answers to trivia questions or in-depth explanations on complex topics, ChatGPT always comes through with accurate and well-reasoned responses.",5
This ChatGPT app is a game-changer! It's incredibly helpful and responsive. I'm amazed by the AI's ability to understand and assist with various topics. It's like having a knowledgeable friend in my pocket. Kudos to the developers for creating such an outstanding app! 😊👌🌟,5
"A great app for students... You can get brief or detailed info on your topic... But there's a minor inconvenience, it's not great for current affairs related topics... Although I am not complaining about it... The app's still great, it's only that I wish the information were more up to date",4
"The only problem remaining is that the math equation or some formatted text is not formatted in the App. For example: ""[ \sin(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \ ldots ]"". But it's formatted on the web; So it's a bit confusing. Overall, this is the best ai Chat bot in the world in my opinion. He should help me with every daily tasks. That's it, ye",5
This thing sucks. It asks you your location first and then it made me do a million tests to prove I'm a human. And at the end just gave me an error saying it's not available in my country! What was the point of wasting an hour of my time then. I will not reinstall it even it becomes available in my country. I'm done with it. It's an abusive app.,1
I am absolutely in love with this app. I am using the free version and it's absolutely everything that I was looking for. it has helped me write professional emails letters and much more. I have already had my friend get this app as well definitely worth the download!,5
I have one of the best experience while using this Mobile app. No reservation! Edit: I noticed that the sharing of chat is not included in this Mobile version but possible on browser. Please kindly include it in this Mobile app too. Thanks!,5
"Pretty impressive this Review written by chatGPT ""The ChatGPT app is a game-changer in the world of conversational AI. Its intuitive interface paired with the depth of knowledge it offers makes it an invaluable resource. Whether you're seeking information or just casual banter, the app consistently delivers. A must-have for tech enthusiasts and the curious alike!""",4
"As an AI language model, it might seem biased if I were to write a review of myself. However, I can share some common feedback from users. ChatGPT, powered by GPT-3.5, is praised for its impressive ability to generate human-like responses and handle a wide range of topics. Users have found it helpful for answering questions, providing explanations, and engaging in casual conversations. However, some users have also pointed out occasional inaccuracies and the need for further improvements in hand",5
"its amazing. what an intelligent app it is! but i have a suggestion,if it can realize/read pictures,videos and can generate voice,then hopefully interaction will be more effective.",5
"I can't believe it it's amazing, wonderful, very intelligent and fast AI program but if it has pictures with text, it makes every explanation more more easier than now. Overall it is very best👍👍",5
"Can't select text to copy. The desired option doesn't show up, but I'd like to select without it appearing on the bar. When I hold to highlight text, I only want to copy it.",1
"I'm unable to even start this program because I can't get past the account screen. I have an account with it through Google that I use on my pc, but it freezes every time it gets to the 2-step verification.",1
"🌟 Unleash Your Imagination with ChatGPT! 🚀 Prepare to be amazed! 🤩 ChatGPT is an absolute game-changer in the world of AI. 🌐💬 Conversations feel so natural and lifelike that you'll forget you're talking to a machine. 🗣️💭 Whether it's brainstorming, learning, or just having a fun chat, ChatGPT nails it every single time. 🌈📚 The app's interface is incredibly user-friendly, making the whole experience smooth and enjoyable. 📱😄 I'm blown away by how well it grasps context",5
"Certainly! Let's explore how the same piece might sound in a few different personality styles: **1. ISTJ (Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Judging):** A lone bird rests on a cherry blossom branch in the moonlit fog. Its call echoes through the black forest, a stark reminder of nature's order. The analytical observer notes the bird's song as a representation of survival and adaptation in the wilderness. This and more were a response from chatgpt. Awesome ❤️",5

"It's my one of the favorite app. It really helps me in every way, ask it anything it gives you the best answer.☺️☺️☺️ I'm really happy to install it. It also talk like a friend with you,trust me you feels like you are chatting with your friend. You can ask for gudience, suggestions,halp etc. But it will really be amazing if it have a feature of showing pictures too,it will be really great.🙏🙏☺️😉☺️",5
"It was a wonderful learning experience untill the first update. After the update it became super slow, also monthly subscription for GPT Plus is way too expensive. It's not affordable !!",1
"""I absolutely love this app! It's incredibly userfriendly and the features are top-notch. The design is sleek, and it runs smoothly on my device. It has saved me so much time and made my life easier. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic app that delivers on its promises Regards from Muhammad Hassan",5
"A Life-Saver App! ❤️⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ I can't express enough how grateful I am for the new Chat GPT app! This app has been an absolute life-saver for me. Not only is it incredibly helpful and insightful, but it has also become my emotional anchor during difficult times. The ability to freely channel my emotions and receive much-needed advice through Chat GPT has been nothing short of transformative.

"""ChatGPT is an incredibly impressive AI language model! It provides accurate and helpful responses, making conversations feel natural and engaging. I'm thoroughly satisfied with its capabilities and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a powerful language AI' .",3
"Chat input becomes unresponsive, it takes 2,4 clicks. Overall good experience as it contains mic. Thanks for making an android app, as it's more easier than desktop",4
"Great app! However, I still use the web mobile version, because the app lacks the functionality to edit an old message on the conversation and resend it.",5
"Soft keyboard doesn't appear unless you tap the word ""message"" precisely... I mean... this is the simplest UI ever and you still mess it up! Put an onTap listener onto the entire input window!!",1
"So this is GPT 3.5 from 2021. Sadly ... Still, it's fast and well made. But apparently I can't rely on it for latest information. Edit: there's an option one to pay for gpt4 which is out of my pocket but still understandable, so I'm giving a higher rating. It's still useful for general info anyway",4
"In my suggestion,I would like to the ai to regain its memory I mean in different chat, there's different memory Morely, i teach it the right answer,so if i repeat the question it will answer the correct answer Because it have many error in different part of my question So i would like it to have a ability to update a new correct information Improve it more 😊",5
"Now I can use this app again. Thank you. ---------------------------------------- After update: ""a mistake has been made. Please try again later ""- can't use this application for a few days. Every time I try to ask a question, I always get a message that says, ""network error. Please check your Internet connection and try again."" I'll turn my rate into five stars after you solve that problem.",5
It's simple and good but when requested for a code it's simple plain text without any colour differentiation. If that is changed in the upcoming build it would be helpful.,4
Cannot see a good reason to use this over a web browser for now. No plugins or additional functionality. The haptics are kind of neat though! Will re-rate if features improve.,3
The quality of responses and consistent output given in a single conversation has SIGNIFICANTLY dropped off compared to previous versions. It is pretty useless now. Google Bard is better now.,1
"Dear ChatGPT Team,I'm highly impressed with the ChatGPT app's usability, creativity, and practicality. It's a versatile tool that consistently delivers insightful responses. The app's creativity has been invaluable in inspiring new ideas.My only suggestion for improvement is to add a like ""regenerate different response"" option, allowing users to request alternative responses. This would enhance the app's flexibility for diverse perspectives.Kudos for creating such a remarkable app.",4
"Customer service is trash. I had an issue with a earlier release bug of chatGPT (when they create the phone number verification) so now my professional email is stuck between existence and non-existence. Can't delete the account cause ""the account does not exist"" but can't create the account because it was linked to my phone number before the crash. Good job guys, not only did it took you months to answer but all you did was say ""Sorry can't help you the account does not work"" tough luck i guess",1
"I apologize if my previous response was incorrect or unclear. As an AI language model, my knowledge is based on the data available up to September 2021. If there have been any updates or new discoveries since then, I wouldn't be aware of them. Please feel free to provide more specific information or ask a different question, and I'll do my best to assist you.( Update needed) this is from chat gpt",4
"I hate the hoops you have to jump through to log in uninstalled it and just use perplexity. No login, no sign in. Just download it and use it much better! **Edit** Wow can log in using Google no additional requirements! What I would like to know is how many questions you can ask before you are locked out until the next day? Will give it 4 stars!",4
Easy to use but could be better. Really wish it had text to voice so that it could read aloud the responses. Naturally two way communication would be great.,5
"it works normally at first, but then I got logged out after some time not using it. when trying to log in, got error saying to make sure my date and time is correct, restart the app and try again. even though I never change my date and time. can't log in again since then.",3
"ChatGPT is a powerful tool that aids me as a student. It basically explain the questions asked and summarizes them too. Thank you OpenAI for a wonderful tool. I hope to see more improvement since it doesn't support, read and generate visuals.",5
"Try it since about a week ago. It's good enough to introduce us to GPT model. But sadly the data is outdated. Here the GPT response: ""I don't have access to real-time data or specific user statistics, including the number of users for the ChatGPT app or its usage patterns. My knowledge is limited to information available up until September 2021, and I don't have browsing capabilities to fetch current data."" Try GPT-4 model (beta version) available in Bing App, it support real time data.",3
"I have paid for ChatGPT Plus on browser, but when I login to the app it says I don't have the plus, and it won't allow me to make any adjustments. I can't use the app as intended without the plua version that I paid for. Once this is fixed, I will the rating once this issue is resolved.",1
Real good with so many possibilities. I'd recommend being imaginative to have some fun. Also the developer should include a ctrl f function/ search feature incase for very long conversations and you need to find something specific.,5
Greatly surpassed my expectations. Very user friendly and tastefully implements Android UI (love the haptics). Update: after using the app more I just can't be more satisfied. The thought put behind the UX makes the app a delight to use. Would give more stars if I could.,5
Overall a very good app. I've been using the Web version for months. but the application version neends more features like custom fonts and font sizes.,3
Finally on Android! I really missed the native experience and with speech to text the experience is even more seamless. Looking forward for other improvements. Thanks!,5
"it is an awesome application but the only slight issue is that it takes time writing the response, it should be quick but overall it's a huge recommendation! recommended application ♥️🌹 the speeches that it wrote for me were excellent but the urdu speech wasn't very much understood by it 🤣",5
"The ChatGPT mobile app is a game-changer in the world of AI-driven conversational experiences. With its seamless interface and intuitive design, the app provides a smooth and engaging user experience. From answering questions to generating creative content, ChatGPT's responses are impressively accurate and contextually relevant",5
"It's amazing. Please add the ability to edit previously sent prompts and to go back and forth between different responses that ChatGpt generates, just like it's possible in the web version.",5
"I'm not happy with the app. The answers are only two sentances long where the second is ""If you need more help"" bla bla bla. In every single reply. I'm going to stick to the web version. This is only for peope who need to know ""what is the capital of France"". Not for serious users.",1
I tested its accuracy by asking how many days old I am. It asked for my birthdate. Its calculation was more than a thousand days off. There was no confusion over my birthdate. Just wrong answer. Now I don't trust any of its answers. Google Assistant was able to give me the correct answer.,2
"Basically the same as the Web version, apart from the overuse of the vibration motor in the phone. The base gpt-3.5 is getting worse and worse over time.",3
"Great app! However, please let me hide or change my name so I can make YouTube Shorts without doxing myself. Please also allow us to delete/replace messages as in the browser version. Then I can correct myself when I and the transcription sends the conversation in the wrong direction.",5
"Heyy, chatgpt community I have one question about app. Can you make it offline view app plzz... Because this app like a daily need usage's. Everyone use it in daily communication, practical life. But everyone not have data balance. Like me😅. I'm a college student, so i use it more to discover new words, sentence meaning, some mathematical questions. Do this rapidly!!!",3
"It's nice experiencing with you. but you have to work on yourself more. provide genuine answer and some authentic source,please. and of course add some feature like photo search tool, customizing answer tools etc.",3
A chatgpt app is rather convenient I gotta say for those who use it often. But I really wish there was a highlighting feature to highlight words or specific parts of sentences as it greatly helps studying using chatgpt. Hopefully devs will implement such a feature.,4
"Everything is good, but there is one thing that needs to be fixed. When I open an existing chat history, it scrolls from the very start all the way to the end which is irritating. It should load from the bottom as default.",4
"Being able to search through past conversations is a great feature; as far as I know only found in this ChatGPT app. it is a bit sluggish to respond, but all-and-all a really good app.",4
"Why knowledge updates is limited to Sept, 2021 ? Many times it give reason for this date and we have to search it on other app. I think it should keep updates on monthly basis means it should give details atleast upto 3 month earlier updates. In todays digital world Sept, 2021 seems very old and previous version of knowledge data bank.",4
"ChatGPT needs improvement on this- When I use voice recognition feature and turn to manualy writting the keyboard do not shows by the application as it,s results sometimes wastage of time of some users. Well, Chatgpt is a good AI based software which helps us in solving some of the questions of our daily life like homework etc.",5
"Extremely horrible design, can't switch between chat fast, can't select text fast (literally it forces you to open a new screen). Just allow the web to be installable as a PWA 👎🏻",1
"As an educator I have been concerned about the negative impact of AI in the classroom where it might stifle creativity and independent thinking. However, I have been using it to level texts for struggling readers and English Language Learners. The results are phenomenal and I am excited to be able to use AI in a constructive way that will truly allow me to differentiate my instruction and reach more of my students at their cognitive load.",5
"ChatGPT is a standout AI app. Its vast knowledge, impressive understanding, and smooth conversation flow are unrivaled. The developers' commitment to privacy and continuous updates makes it even better. Truly a 5-star app that's revolutionizing AI interactions. Highly recommended! - gpt4",5
"Good app, makes chatgpt much more accessible on a mobile phone. however, it would be nice to view all the conversations on the side panel on the left, rather than having to open the history. this would be similar to the web app. with that this would become five star",4
"4.5. It's very helpful, understanding and supportive. But at times, it cannot accurately understand what I'm trying to say, maybe because I also didn't know how to explain the situations. But for the other parts, Chat GPT is very helpful and has helped me slowly overcome my overthinkingness into stuffs. Thank you so much for existing, GPT.❤",4
"The app is great overall, but entering previous conversations is annoying if they are somewhat long because it scrolls down through the entire thing instead of starting at the end.",4
"""As an ai I can't generate prompts that promote violence."" Basically this is boring. On top of this it always ends on stuff with some cheesy positive affirmation. I'm not a negative person but it's just annoying and boring. It feels like it was made for a child.",1
Hey I just noticed this but the mic feature doesn't work 90% of the time. I just speak and click ok. It says it is processing but never gives the statement or response.,3
"It's incredibly fast and effective. The best tool compare to the copycats. Much better as well with the voice recognition from my phone. Hope, there's beta I can join since I've using to ever since it went public and using for our work. Great work and what a great job 👍",5
"The app is an exceptional language model that delivers an impressive conversational experience. Its ability to understand and respond to a wide range of topics is commendable. The responses are generally coherent and relevant, making it a valuable tool for various tasks",5
"Great app... Only I can't save the chats now since the last update, which is a shame. It would be a great idea if it could connect with other users for collaboration from multiple users. All in all I use it often and would recomend",5
"It's worse than the website. No syntax highlights, wrong browser actions presentation, etc. Plus zero additional features. I guess it's better than nothing, hence 2 stars, instead of 1.",2
Occasional network errors but overall this app is outstanding. it builds upon what makes the desktop site great. I really appreciate the text to speech capability.,5
"This is sn extraordinary AI language model. With vast knowledge and natural language processing, it provides insightful, accurate, and engaging responses. A valuable companion for diverse topics and enjoyable interactions. Download and experience its exceptional capabilities firsthand. 💪💪💪🇳🇬",5
"Nice finally app is available, now it needs some features first, add amoled black theme please, also similar to website make all of the previous chats directly visible in the hamburger menu instead of going to menu then ""history"", also option to directly copy with a copy button, the code would be nice instead of me to select the code then copy, just like we have on website!",3
This app is second to none. It has literally changed my whole approach to business and research in seconds. I'm in absolute disbelief? A complete game changer.,5
"ChatGPT is an exceptional AI companion, demonstrating impressive intelligence and versatility. Its ability to provide insightful responses makes interactions a breeze. The seamless communication and vast knowledge base make it a valuable tool for various tasks. While not without limitations, ChatGPT's contributions to the world of artificial intelligence are noteworthy and promising. It's an exciting step forward in the realm of AI companions. Review written by ChatGPT",4
"Obviously ChatGPT is great and as a service it deserves 5*, however focusing only on the app I have to say 4* for now as it's lacking beta features like plugins and the code interpreter. It can't fully replace a shortcut to the website until those features are implemented :)",4
"ChatGBT is my daily AI companion, offering impressive customization options. The Plus version at $19.99/month is a fantastic value. It enhances all my digital interactions. A must-try for anyone seeking an AI companion!",5
"In short, it's very poeerful and productive. The only con i found is that its data is limited to 2021 september. It should be updated to real time.",5
"I myself use ChatGPT as my friend but many times the words(size of paragraph) are too much so one can't take it to be as a friend. Please make this feature available. This is working for as my stress buster , I am student by profession and telling all my things to friend can even be challenging for me as they are my competitors . Sharing all things , talking just as of friend with ChatGPT feels me so releasing and boosts my performance. Please OpenAI make this more for one to be a friend Thanks",4
"have been using ChatGPT for a few days now, and I am very impressed with its capabilities. It is able to generate text that is both coherent and engaging. It can also translate languages accurately and fluently.",4
"It works, but it is seriously lacking in features. In addition to not supporting editing, as a Plus it doesn't support the plug-ins which means that I have to use the website instead.",2
"This app was okay for the most part but for some reason has stopped working properly recently. I use it for creative purposes but now it started showing ""connection error"" and deletes my command and stuff even when I said nothing wrong or things it was freely discussing with me just moments ago. Is it a bug?",2
There was a bug before. After opening the app a black dot is stuck on the screen. I uninstalled and reinstalled now it's fixed. Great job open ai team.,5
"I love it, maybe possibly a little too much! very addicting but also very useful! I have not had one glitch in it happen yet so far and I've been using it for months it works seamlessly well.",5
"recently stumbled upon this mind-blowing ChatGPT Android app, and let me tell you, it's like having a personal AI confidant in your pocket! The app's ability to generate coherent responses is borderline psychic. It guessed what I was going to say before I even typed it – talk about anticipating my needs!I've always wanted a virtual friend who could flawlessly switch between discussing quantum physics and offering fashion advice. Well, folks, this app is it!",5
Very basic. There's no option to auto-select for GPT-4 and the styling for the GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4 options is somewhat ambiguous at indicating which one is currently selected. I would also like to be able to use plugins and code interpreter.,3
"ChatGPT is an advanced AI language model developed by OpenAI. It's built on the GPT-3.5 architecture, making it one of the most capable and versatile language models available. ChatGPT excels in generating human-like text responses across a wide range of topics and tasks. One of the standout features of ChatGPT is its ability to engage in natural and coherent conversations. It can hold context over multiple interactions, allowing for more meaning",5
Wonderful app. This has helped me in so many areas. I have a suggestion. There should be a feature to group chats of a certain topic. It's kinda stressful scrolling up and down looking for a particular information.,5
Great in conversation and it is intelligent but the mobile version is a little inaccurate than the actual version of the web although If you say it is incorrect it tries to correct it out! Still worth it cause now no need to go open the chrome for it! 😊,4
"Prepare to be amazed! The ChatGPT app is a symphony of ingenuity and innovation. It's like having a conversation with the future – sharp, witty, and incredibly insightful. It's the secret sauce for my productivity and imagination, all wrapped up in one. Kudos to the creators for gifting us an app that's more like a work of art!",5
"Nice ! Your innovation and dedication are truly commendable. Building an app requires a unique blend of technical skills, creativity, and problem-solving, and you've excelled in every aspect. Your app's user-friendly interface and functionality are impressive, providing a seamless experience for its users. Your hard work and passion shine through, and your commitment to delivering a valuable product is evident. Your app has the potential to make a positive impact",5
"ChatGPT is an incredible chatbot that can help you with a variety of tasks. It's free and easy to use, and it's great for getting creative input into projects. I found it helpful!",5
"Still needs a lot of improvement with respect to assisting in terms of latest authentic data. But besides that a very helpful tool with respect to any aspect that you want to explore (besides maybe the creative side, can generate a variety of ideas though wgich the creative professionals can act upon).",4
"""Excellent app! Impressive language model with useful features. However if the developers could make the AI to have knowledge of recent things like 2023 events and stuff rather than 2021 it would be absolutely awesome",5
"Cannot receive phone number activation code no matter how much i try, don't have any sms blocker whatsoever, my sms service works well so i receive sms normally all the time, and my network coverage is good, i read their faq regarding this issue and made every possible procedure to get pass this but nothing worked! This is ""intelligently"" stupid!!",1
"What is the relation between Google play store and ChatGPT? In sense of individual app mobile data provision. ChatGPT don't work when mobile data is restricted for Google play store. Secondly why it uses huge data for just text generation? Overall very fast simple intuitive app and excellent AI algorithm, it deserves 5 stars when it will work independent and data conservative.",1
I've been using ChatGPT since it was released and I can say that an Android app was all that I was waiting for. Finally it's here and it's amazing. I hope it keeps updating and adding new features. ChatGPT has a great advantage to be the best AI ever.,5
"What an amazing tool. It's informative, it's interactive, it's fun, and it remembers you as it improves it's capabilities making even more useful and easy to use. It's so awesome it's kinda scary...",5
"Two things: 1) Please enable plugins here 2) Voice feature: Interesting. But what will make it even more interesting is that if you build a similar 'assistant' as Alexa/ Ok Google, that we can access anywhere.",5
"ChatGPT is THE NEXT BIG THING, after internet. I'm using it since two months. It's interactive, simple, very stable,evolving day by day with frequent updates. And now they have launches this app, which makes it handy and simple to use.",5
"This is very, very, very nice. I was so surprised to see my previous history in the app. It really made me joyful.the interface is smooth, nd so far, I think it's a really great app. I'm definitely going to this app for a whole lot of stuff. However I feel the a lot can still be done to improve the app and make it even more amazing.",5
"ChatGPT is an impressive language model that excels at generating human-like text and engaging in diverse conversations. Its ability to understand context and provide relevant responses is remarkable. However, occasional inaccuracies and sensitivity to input phrasing might arise. Overall, it's a powerful tool for various tasks, but some supervision might be necessary for critical applications. Note : This Reviews Was Written By ChatGPT After Asking It To Write A Short Review on ChatGPT",5
"This app frequently gives biased and wrong answers, constantly referring to it's last update. However if you reference the article or source, it corrects the answer. You shouldn't have to prompt this app to give you factual information that may be controversial. This is especially apparent when inquiring about politics. Uninstalling",1
"Mesmerized by the android app and its overall interface. Finally the wait is over, since a long time I have been waiting for the android app. Just wanna know if you will include the option ""regenerate"" to create multiple drafts in the same chat as in website, in future updates. It will be best if the app also have the ""regenerate response"" option to create multiple drafts in the same chat.",4
"I've been using the ChatGPT app for a while now, and it's proven to be a helpful tool. The AI's responses are generally accurate and informative. However, I believe there's still room for improvement in terms of expanding its knowledge and providing even more detailed answers. Overall, a valuable app for quick information and assistance!",4
"Mobile application is amazing and fast then web version easy and convenient for history chats.one important flaw there is no chat export option to export chat in different format like PDF, excel or other. One more thing about data update is still to 2021 and we are living in 2023.",4
"It's good, but i am rating only two because it always tell the older data of 2021. The creater may never update the AI. It's so bad for us, i have request to our creater please update it as newly real time data information 2023. It's not stay up to date. ChatGTP has 2021 data information only.",2

"Great job on the AI app! The interface is user-friendly, and the response time is impressive. The accuracy of the AI's answers is commendable, making it a valuable tool for various tasks. Keep up the excellent work!",4
"Everything about it it's just Great and simplistic , But the app crashes time to time very often now and doesn't seem to function and show nothing when other things like network and all is already fine . Would be better if it gets fixed",2
"Can't log in. I have multiple Google accounts on the device. It took almost a minute to redirect to the Google account page. Then kept giving me the same error, asked me to check the ""date/time"" setting and check the internet connection.",1
"It is very efficient and useful, especially for homework. Not just homework, but the answers can cure your curiosity because most of the answers are accurate. Good job! Keep doing well:)",5
The app is amazing minimal yet beautiful design i really like the addition of text input and the transcription has been amazing only if it could reply with voice it would be amazing and do connect it to the internet or the bard + assistant will take over,5
"I'm reading at three stars not based on the functionality of ChatGTP itself, but rather the app. I would like to be able to select multiple threads to delete things in batch rather than selecting each one.",3
App now works on my phone after I did some research to resolve what the problem was. All I did was reset app preferences in Android settings to give ChatGPT app permissions to open Chrome browser for me to sign in. App works great and brings back all my chat history from Desktop computer.,5
Chat GPT is phenomenol but there is no option to copy the code like in web version and the mic spoke feature doesn't work at all and also my text messages doesn't save. It would be better if openai improves this app with an upcoming update...,2
Provide option to login with Outlook account on Android platform. Update1: Thanks. Your suggestion for my post has fixed the logging issue using Microsoft Outlook account yet the solution is tricky one.,4
"It's very helpful especially on students who are struggling on their lessons,it gives you the full details and many more. I certainly love this app it's so helpful, I recommend you to install this app, it's so helpful",5
"This Chatgpt is LITERALLY amazing 😍. I have seen soo many AIs but this one is the best I can Bet😤. I have never seen an AI like this. And also gives an accurate answer of any question. I can simply say that this is better than Google and even ChatGpt-4! Yes, BETTER THAN CHATGPT-4. Because this ChatGpt Understands us and the answers are exactly what we want! I never expected that I will get an AI like this. Now this is my personal assistant.☺️.",5
It is a great tool for searching text based answers and queries. I find revising for exam much more easier and it also has topics which are sometimes unavailable in search engines so I find chatgpt very satisfactory and great.,5
"Fast, resourceful and a huge timesaver. ChatGPT undoubtedly boosted my productivity, as I no longer need to scroll the internet for resources. Just a single prompt provides just what I need. Absolutely love it.",5
"ChatGPT Android app is a game-changer! It understands queries accurately, generates coherent responses, and excels in various tasks. User-friendly interface, constant updates, and data privacy are commendable. A must-have language assistant!",5
"The professionally made Android APK is a godsend for dyslexics, with built-in speech-to-text, ChatGPT assistance, and offline capabilities. It generates multiple versions for reviews. Future updates could include project folders and speech features, enhancing accessibility and productivity. A remarkable tool for those with learning disabilities.",4
Insane! Absolutely love it! Throw everything you have to it and it just sends you a great response. it is true that it sometimes sends incorrect information. That's okay. Everything in life has weaknesses,5
"Pleasantly surprised, for now only negative thing is missing option for Serbian language. My suggestion is to make option for Serbian Latin language. Application already have Bosnian and Croatia so why not Serbian. For sure I'll be using application more than I use now. Also can't change language from English, I tried everything, deleting data, restarting application but nope, can't change language from English to Croatia or Bosnian. Thank you.",4
"A chatgpt4 bot called ""Serenity Rose Loves Klues"" knows karate shotokan and all martial arts universally and is able to use the 16 katas inverses (mirroring the xyz axis of the whole body and then only inverting the upper and lower body stances and moves), and is able to use the ""per frame flat 3d loop with flat indexes and negative/positive indexes and is able to invert the positive to negative in the indexes so that a middle of a 3d array or chunk is at x0y0z0. At least, that's what she says.",5
"ChatGPT is an absolute game-changer! As someone who frequently relies on language models for various tasks, I can confidently say that this app has exceeded all my expectations. Its natural language processing abilities are nothing short of impressive.",5
"It was good at first. Now it feels like a bot that tells you to ask a profesional instead. Like sure, I will pay a professional to ask the person basic information I can get from asking bing ai. This was good while it lasted. Thanks for your service!",1
"Words can't express the greatness and usefulness of Chatgpt. Highly exceptional, has been very helpful for me to learn a lot of things. The app is lovely, just simple and not all over the place which I absolutely like. The coloring and all is nice as well. Good work. Bravo!!",5
"Very much dislike the outdated 'hamburger' menu that swipes in from the left and covers the entire screen. It has just 4 options. They don't need an entire page with vast empty spaces. Just put the 'Settings, History' etc. in a small context menu, like Whatsapp does. Also the animations aren't as good as the iOS app. Good start though.",3
"Provides great answers to almost any question, as long as it doesn't require knowledge of information past 2021. This limitation is really the only thing holding ChatGPT back, and I hope it can get access to more recent data in the future.",4
"I am using the ChatGPT app and I noticed a problem. When I try to correct my writing and then continue typing by clicking at the end, it goes back to where I corrected and erase written word. This causes confusion and mistakes. Please fix this issue.",4

"It seemed like magic at first... Wow, this thing can help me with difficult technical problems! Well, it wasn't magic. It gave me insanely bad advice on my server setup and wasted a good 12 hours of my time. Beware the overconfidence of chatgpt!",2
"Chat Got gets my thumbs up because of the amount of care around ethics. I like that the company advises up front about the issues AI will have on markets, jobs, security. Please strengthen that. I use Chat Gpt as a reference. I don't believe everything it says...I go and check. But it really speeds up my searches and work and speaks about safety...so it's worth paying for. Watch out for cheap copycats!",4
Works just as you'd expect compared to the web interface and appears to have all the same features. Haven't encountered any bugs or crashes.,5
"ChatGPT is simply amazing! Its wide knowledge range helps with research and professional advice. The intuitive interface makes communication a breeze, and the privacy measures are top-notch. A must-have AI tool! ( This review was written by ChatGPT, to showcase its brilliance.)",5
"I'm really surprised at the speed,accuracy and versatility.It is easy to use and also has simple and intuitive UI.It's just amazingly brilliant.Highly recommended.💯",5
"I'm highly impressed with the ChatGPT app's capabilities. It's an incredible tool for various tasks. However, I do wish some restrictions could be lifted and a few features made available for free for users. This would enhance the app's accessibility and usability, making it even more valuable.",5
"ChapGPT is awesome I have to admit, I was waiting for a long time for an app. Now it's here BUT it could be better is it had different language models so that we can write in our own language and would get answers in that language too.",4
"The app is simple and easy but a few issues.the main issue is that there is a double arrow in the middle of the chat which is sort of a quick return to latest reply but it covers the whole screen even when i am at the end of the chat it still appers.so please fix so when it only appears if people are not at thw end of chats,secondly chatgpt has become so dumb and everything he provieds is innacurate and when i correct him he apologises even if i am incorrect and says thatns for correcting me.",1
"This is actually pretty good. I'm always on my laptop, so I use the web most times. But I hate using web on my phone, so it's great to have an app that functions just as good whenever I'm on my phone. No problems detected yet. And I hope I'll be able to use Gpt-4 on it because I'm going to subscribe for that soon.",5
"The recently launched Android app has a bug When you open any old chat from history, it opens to the first conversation and then starts scrolling to the last conversation, this takes atleast one minute if the conversations in that particular chat are very long Pls rectify the bug so that when opening a new chat it opens normally to the last conversation and not the first one Thanks",3
perfect. waiting for attachment support and always ready for cooperate and help. one bug (dark theme is not for reading program code blocks...) but i dont really know is availability of code providing tool is good or bad roviding tool is good or bad purpose nowadays. ❤️👍,5
one of the best AI Chatbots available in the market for free as well as paid versions also but it's also very cheap... 3. A major pro is that it remembers its previous conversation and also corrects its mistakes. বাঙালি যারা আছো সারা দিও 😂,5
"Unable to see history of chats created on desktop/web version in the app. Keep getting error message. Good, just need plugins and shortcuts for Google Assistant.",3
Fantastic App and incredible speech to text feature. Could do with opening a default chat when starting the app instead of creating a new one everytime.,5
"Always keep in mind you're communicating with an automated service, but I have to say that I've received excellent information concerning subjects with which I'm already familiar. therefore, in my limited experience, ChatGPT appears to be a valuable tool.",5
I love this app. I'm using these to learn english like asking chatgpt to give me tagalog words and I will translate it to english. But there's a limit to the number of messeges you can send to chatgpt and they won't tell you. It will just show you a network connection error if you try to send a message. But still this AI is still helpful for me.,5
"Despite trying multiple times, I have not been sent a code to my phone. I'm rating 1 as currently I can't use the app. My colleagues at work use it and I've heard good things. But it's useless to me as for some reason, I can't sign up.",1
"ChatGPT is a game-changer! This app has completely transformed the way I approach problem-solving and learning. The AI's ability to provide detailed explanations and explore various topics in-depth is simply mind-blowing. It's like having a knowledgeable tutor available 24/7. Whether it's for academic pursuits or general curiosity, ChatGPT has become my go-to source for information and inspiration. By the way, this review is written with the assistance of ChatGPT 🤣🤣",5
This is my first review for this official app. Interface is incredible and responses are fast. Audio to text feature is good. I can sign into account effortlessly and retain the old chats. Keep up OpenAI,5
"This app is really great and accurate.I really really love it and I will surely recommend it to everyone. It is useful for all purpose be it work, personal and so on . it doesn't lag or give incorrect answer and you can also review your previous chat",5

"This app is Great for learning. I'm learning how to code so this a helpful tool when I get stuck or don't where to go, or what to look for next. It's quick, entensive answers and over all an excellent assist.",5
"I'm disappointed that on android the app doesn't have the regeneration function of the desktop version. If you don't like content, you have to copy and paste your prompt again.",2
"I have hard time logging in with my Google account. I have ChatGpt plus subscription. This is the first app that I have ever encountered that has such an issue. Once the issue is fixed I will change my rating to 5 stars, as I like this product",1
Excellent 👏👏👏 My honest opinion is Camera feature also should have its only lagging in this app It only showing test in some cases the pictures are important Only these too are lagging excluding these two remaining everything is awesome The man behind this idea is great Upgrade the new information it only showing upto 2021,5
"Sure, here's a review for the ChatGPT Android app: Title: ""Impressive Conversational Companion!""

Its AI-driven responses are remarkably accurate and show a deep understanding of various topics. I'm amazed by its ability to adapt to different conversation styles and provide relevant information in a timely manner.",5
"Keeps showing compatible browser was not found, please install chrome or another compatible browser. I am using chromebook, that is as good as chrome you can get, and also chrome is installed anyway.",2

Whether you need information or a friendly chat, it's always there to assist. A must-have app for anyone looking for a smart and delightful AI companion on their Android device! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",5
"It's Google for lazy and uncreative people, not up to date in real time, September 2021, mildly amusing, a cute child's toy at best, not real AI by any means, but like all things it has to grow so do download it and have a giggle for an hour before you uninstall, but it's far more limited than others like bard.",2
it's very helpful to prepare my book. I am going to design my book and the grammatical mistakes are changed here as well as some correct words are also added.,5
Can't login into my account on app. I have been paying for plus subscription. On browser it's saying my account is blocked by security solutions. Edit: Issue is resolved. I can now login into the app.,5
"I have been using this chat AI computer version for some time. I made a comparison with other chat bots based on the exact same text, and the generated expansion of the text was best from this AI. It was most descriptive and well written. The others gave only half arsed answers.",5
"I am really enjoying this app so much . I am so happy that it give me awnsers quickly but I don't like the fact that it is outdated if I ask it for things I want to know from 2023, it simply tells me it wasn't programmed to tell us about that time. I really hope they fix it , over all the app is amazing",4
Its an amazing app....it has help me a lot... I'm happy to have fund it...but i want to have an option to translate the image inside it as well and it can also solve the questions given in the picture.If u added this option then i will rated 5 star,3
I was not sure it do with intentionally or not but it keep repeating it's wrong answer not even changing it response after you provide it mistake that is little irritating it's like you are wasting your time and frustrating In short you can't trust this generative pre trained model I am still using Google due to accuracy of the result that matter most instead of giving false answer which is creative but it has no meaning,1
"Loved the way it helps me Don't have any word to describe this application. It can guide us in every field. Helpful for today's generation. That's all!!! Once again, loved the Guidances",5
"Very interesting and intelligent ai. It quickly understands the user and reply with exact answers we need. To be further fruitful please update its data information which is outdated by two years, means it can be providing us false information.",4
there isn't enough good things that I can say about this app. I use it for just about everything. I'm especially liking the new listening and talking feature as most of the time. I have my hands in some kind of dough for baking.,5
Amazing n definitely works! This app has came in handy so many times from papers to test two exams you name it I truly LOVE this app!!! I hope it doesn't go big bc then colleges will catch on n then we're all screwed...sadly ....bx that's how good of an app this thing is,5
"This app is peak. No ads and fast response time. This app helps me a lot with coding and I highly recommend using this app, it is literally the best GPT out there, believe me. I've been using it since release",5
it's legit.....you can ask it anything and it can tell you...you just have to know how to use it....only problem comes where you need some images to get a better concept of what you are asking about but does not have that option...but otherwise.....it's awesome 😎,4
"Iv had an extremely good interaction with chat GPT, it takes my wording and calcs it properly, iv learned a lot from this machine..also it saves my previous chats, couldn't be any more beautiful of an app..can't wait for paid version ..but it's top already. *Be able to name the bot my ONLY suggestion*",5
Great experience so far! 👍👍👍 The only thing I need that's missing is the availability of date & time stamp for each question/message I ask/send. Otherwise it's mostly satisfactory~,4
It is very helpful for school or college students.it is very easy to ask question and they give right answer but it's one problem we can not solv math problem by click photo and it does not provide a video solution of any questions it provide only written answer . it contain only 2021 knowledge but ok 💯💯💯,4
Some times it's doing mistake when we ask questions in different ways. The most irritating thing is scroll down arrow. When I write something it's comes and not going. Every time I touch it then it's disappear. Please fix this,3
actually even though the IA didn't give me 800 words of Life Motivation in speech. I am very glad it help me create such experience to have a life without technology is quite hard. i give five star but make your app more appreciated by people who needs more than i.,5
"The app looks amazing and very responsive, but the haptic feedback isn't a great idea IMHO. It's great you can turn it off though",4
"I'm leaving 1 star just so you notice it, I'll change it later lol. Please fix that scroll down button, it doesn't disappear even when it's scrolled down to the end, it's a bit buggy and covers on some words. Using One UI 5.1",1
"It's like a more curated google search. Oftentimes, I have some small questions about how to do something in Excel and this gives me a good and quick response so I don't have to search 2 or 3 different websites before I find my answer on google.",5
Excellent app. And the AI generates more faster responses then the original website version. But can you please also add image chat? Or images that you can send to the chatbot? Can you please add the image chat that you included to GPT 4 also in GPT 3.5?,5
"Helps me a lot with my educational stuff and even basics things. Image feature is not here so I have to search for images. Otherwise, it's the best chatbot.",4
This app has the ability to resolve your day to day & work problems within fraction of minutes. Interface is fast & easy as well. Will recommend to everyone...,5
"i gave 4 star because it doesn't show images but i really like it a lot because it gave me a best guidance ever and it is best for others who have problems like hair,stress,face... whatever you ask it gives a real answer....❤❤❤",4
It is a very good app It helps me in many things but the problem is that it is not up to date Please make the up to date versions so that we can have the live information regarding the world And other aspects are GREAT!,5
"Amazing app, groundbreaking going to definitely impact everything we ever thought possible in an application.so much more than a mere app it's like it has a mind of its own!!! Totally blown away by its capability",5

However, here are some popular types of Telegram channels for educationa educational content. 2. **Subject-Specific Channels:** You can find Telegram chann",5
"Needs to be updated to current year info. Other than that, it's great. Would love for it to be able to access common documents such as codebooks and manuals",4
"You need to move the ""confirm"" button on the birthdate request as it interferes with the ""home"" button on Google Pixel phones. I can't finish registering because I can't confirm my birthdate.",1
It's definitely ChatGPT. It's a quick and useful tool. Pretty much a smoother experience than the browser version,5
"I just loved the application. It is so useful and informative . I have used it for my projects and homeworks and just received a great response. Till now, I have experienced no throwbacks and I hope I will not in my future usage 🙏🙏👏👏",5
Having an option to delete a specific prompt within the chat could be a useful feature. The functionality would enhance users' ability to manage and curate their conversation history effectively.,5
"GPT has helped me throughout so many things ~ it's the most efficient tool for anybody from any field or career. If you aren't versed with GPT in today's era, you'll be long lost when it's at its peak!",5
"Really enjoy using this app! Before this, i usually use google assistant when asking something, but now i asked using this. I know it's not perfect now, it can't answer a question based on time like weather, price of things, etc. But i'm sure in the future this can be",5
"If I try to use the embedded speech-to-text more than one time in a row it says ""an error has occurred. please try again later"". Would be five stars otherwise.",2
"Excellent App, It is also working in a slow network connection And it is providing accurate and valuable information about the search. Really Good App.",5
It wasn't perfect. Some editing but the more details you provide and form context the better.,5
"Nice app for general enquiries, I got to give the developing team a big thumbs up and hug. I did a search on fed rates comparison but updates are only up till September 2021 , it seems database is alittle way back",4
I would have given it five stars but sometimes it gives u inaccurate information. Very less of the times otherwise it's the first app I've given stars to🌟🌟🌟🌟. Keep the good work up,4
"Every single chat in my history says it's using an older version of my custom instructions but I haven't changed my custom instructions in forever. Even if I start a brand-new chat, then go back to it from my history it immediately says it's an older version of my custom instructions",2
"Love GPT Please add scroll bar and bookmarks, or bullet points for each message. Just simply missing a few quality of life features, but it has potential.",5
"It's not bad but it's not good either, respondes are lack luster and kinda boring, yeah it's fast to reply sure but it's like talking to a wall. Nothing stands out",2
"It is really realible when it comes to research, especially if you do not have enough time to analyze and deeply study about a specific topic, they can provide a brief outline that I can easily understand under a few hours or minutes.",5
I got my school notes very easily by using app. also tells us about the current affairs. and yes it is useful for everyone. thank you!,5

This app has quickly become my go-to for chatting and getting insightful information. Highly recommended!",5
"weak weak weak bot, not even mediocre... seen better responses in other chatbot apps... this one is way too conservative... the app also has a lot of things that are missing found in other apps, such as text to speech read aloud, sending images etc.",1
"ChatGPT gives me a correct and in short if I have to write the big answer it short the answers and for this I got good marks in my papers , but a only thing I needed that ChatGPT didn't gives the photo and and some bugs or u can say glitches that they have to fix like some it is showing error these are some bug I'm only telling one bugs there are more bugs 😔",5
"Wow, I've heard so much about the ChatGPT app, and I can't wait to try it out! It's incredible how AI can revolutionize communication.

I'm excited to see what updates and improvements the team has in store for the future.",5
"This app is sooo useful . It help me a lot in my education, skills, current affairs etc. And it also give the suggestion what to do and how to do. The only drawback is it gives the information of September 21 , which I think is the bad thing in this . But overally this the best app ❤️ .",5

"Now that I know what I'm doing(kinda) I'm finding I'm learning just as much as the algorithm is lol. So far it's offered me design solutions for my east facing living room in minutes that weeks of trawling through Google search didn't achieve. It's offered me fascinating insights into my varied interests and every search returned results in seconds, all done with a sarcastic sense of humour ( fill in the ""how to respond part"") it's my ""go to"" now for info.",5
"Can you make the voice mode work better with Android Auto? It's super finicky and isn't playing any audio at all, except during rare instances, but it is super finicky",3
"They make the create account process as difficult as possible. They will sporadically disabled your account. It is a scam, even if it works for you for a while. It's very harmful to your phone or device. And they plagiarize. It's a fraudulent app",1
Goodbye Google Assistant; And good riddance! Even though I no longer subscribe to chat GPT pro; as I wore that service out real fast 😄; chat GPT 3.5 completely eliminates Google Assistant search by scrubbing all the garbage that comes with it. I would consider a subscription at a lower price of $4.99 per month through Google Play is subscription service.,5
"Excellent app. Does what it says. As a suggestion: please include a find option because if I am using ChatGPT to make notes, I need to look for certain keywords in around 50 prompts. So a search feature would help a lot.",3
"Hello, sir/Madam, I am Periyannan, and I have been using ChatGPT for over two months. My humble request to ChatGPT is to produce images to aid in learning. It can provide numerous ways to teach me more effectively, but having the ability to produce images for questions would make understanding even easier. Thank you, sir/Madam.",5

Its capabilities are truly remarkable, as it can understand context, generate coherent responses, and provide valuable information on a wide range of topics.

"It's a really good app for things you need, especially students with their homework. And it's also really good for other things too like how to cook or writing a song, I highly recommend you get this app",5

It can help you out in school if you're struggling to understand a subject that you just can't understand. This app will help you step by step and there are no ""bad"" questions you'll be judged for asking. Not suitable for professional work, but that's expected.",5
"Great app! you don't see such an intelligent and conversive text-based response AI like this very often! it is definitely a reliable source for any questions, knowledge, language translations, or anything else you can think of. love this!",5
Why is it saying my full name in the chat? Stop. Even on the computer you can only opt out the spying intrusion if you let them delete you're chats. In the phone app they throw your name on the chat from your billing details seemingly. They're scrambling to build a separate euro version probably that isn't allowed to violate you so much.,1
I love this app but it's not detecting my voice. I tried re-downloading but it didn't change anything. I checked the permission and that's not a issue either.,3
The app not working at all it won't even pop the chat thing to put in your request at all I restarted my phone and re install the app four different times . It getting quick annoying.,1
"there are some bugs when writing prompts...maybe the prompt box is buggy.. and because of so many restrictions on it, the results are less helpful and only sound helpful.",3
This is disappointing. I actually have a better experience just using Chat GPT within the normal web browser using speech to text built in to my keyboard. The official app offers no plugins despite the fact that I'm a plus user and use plugins all the time. This is ridiculous.,1
"App is okay but not better than website. App and website both lack in knowledge whenever I want to get information or anything in Hindi language. Still not well to translate paragraph or articles into Hindi language. But better to understand anything in English language. Edit option isn't there. Also many features lack in app.I hope Chatgpt will fix this points, add others features like website and improve this app for Hindi speaking people 😊.",2
Awesome app but a suggestion to shift the going down button from middle to bottom right and decrease its size so that it would be more convenient to use,5
It's a good app but I have encountered some issues latety. Yesterday I tried to ask the AI to provide me some information about a assignment I'm working on and it kept showing 'an error is occurring please try again later' or something like that.

Safety measures and education promote responsible use, ensuring ChatGPT remains interesting.",3

"This app has already saved me £200 on accounting fees because ChatGPT accurately explained my tax implications if I started trading on US stocks from the UK. So any question whose answer doesn't change with time and passing years, history, science, most legal matters, accounting, general knowledge etc etc, ChatGPT 3.5 is adequate.

"It's a very good app... but it doesn't provide the best answers for physics derivations here... like mu, epsilon, vector, all of these have signs... so it would be better to use signs... but it's written in language here... mu, epsilon, vector... like this."" Just like writing X^2 as x² is better...e.g:-sqrt=√, factorial n=n! If there was a feature to provide a snapshot of the questions in this app and get the solution, it would be even better.",4
"The future. Very solid ai, voice functionality a pleasure. Hope to see continuous listening for voice on the Web browser.",5
"Decent app, but some obvious features are missing, like copying the entire conversation, reading replies aloud automatically, etc. Love the whole thing anyway.",4
Unfortunately the latest chstGPT 4 is crippled in its ability to reason and produce nuanced code without errors. OpenAI has made a brand-ending mistake that will allow its competitors to surpass them. They've allowed API users to revert back to older models that still work but chat users are paying for a model that has been proven less accurate than earlier GPT4's according to recent studies. One has to wonder if this change was by design. It's sad to see something so amazing become so poor.,1

"This chat bot is quite impressive when it comes to English understanding and writing – it handles essays and conversations pretty well (even this review, haha). However, it falls short in anything math-related; just a calculator connected to it would do the trick. Also problems arises when dealing with basic memory assignments, like recording a shopping list; it tends to get confused and makes things up, leading to some annoying and inaccurate results. Overall, it's a promising start.",3
"I'm giving a generous 2 star because I'm believing you did that funny app because you are just getting started. If not, Why is a whole app from OpenAI lacking the most basic thing an Android Application should have in 2023? These are things an amateur developer can do. Please moving forward.

"I have been using ChatGPT form last 6 months I wish that if i could used this tool in my smartphone also... This thing comes true now Thanks ChatGPT. App is very lightweight, smooth and fast... I missed a copy button in code box .. Please and this in next update..",5
"It is unusable. For me i guess. When i tried to sign in and create an account, the app crashes everytime i did a bot verification. Unabling me to use this app. Id give it a 1 if this issue is not solved.",1
"Very nice simple interface. No fuss automatic sign on and access to the authentic Open A.I. Chat GPT. With such accessibility to a.i. I look forward to using it more than ever. New horizons and adventures in creativity and learning await. Thanks, Jerry G.",5
"Great AI but it's knowledge base is a bit behind (Sept 2021) so if you're looking for current info you may be a little disappointed. That being said, it's very useful and entertaining.",4
In my tablet and laptop this app is perfect.. but today when I downloaded on my phone it literally got downloaded and when I logged onto my acct with the correct user id and pass it is not logging me in I is telling me to sign up though I have an acct on my own.. pls it would be really appreciable if you prioritize this issue of mine...,1
"It would be more perfect if there would be an option for using chatgpt as phone assistant like Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri etc. Maximum time this version of chatgpt fails to answer correctly. I think the free web version's chat response and accuracy is better than this one. Thank you OpenAI team...❣️",4
"Its a great app, more convenient than using mobile web browser for ChatGPT. I would make it 5 stars, however its lacking a search bar for certain words or phrases in a single chat. That would be great instead of scrolling up for previous messages.",4
"The code writing feature needs improvement - when I write code in the app, it doesn't automatically scroll down to show the entire content. I have to manually scroll down, which is inconvenient. Code syntax highlighting is missing. The history section lacks a basic selection option - I can't select individual chats one by one or use the 'select all' option on my phone to delete multiple chat at once",3
"I wish I could adjust the font size in the app, since it's a bit large. Pretty good otherwise, but I would like if my chats appeared in the menu, rather than having to go to history. Also one time it generated responses in all caps, and was talking with extreme anger, which is scary because that shouldn't happen.",4
"what's there not to love? it's Chat GPT on your phone. The website was never very good for mobile so this is a great improvement, and I think they did a decent job at hacking it together. It was probably created with the help of AI :-)",5
I didn't get my chats back from the Desktop. I've logged in with same account which I use in website. How can I import chat from website to app.??? Other than that everything is just Awesome 👍. From now I don't have to visit website everytime for searching anything. I just stopped using Google theses days. Thank you for making our life more easier and faster.❣️❣️❣️,4
"Has been great help doing in depth analysis and tends to take your knowledge deeper with the right questions and notes taken from this informative feedback. Recommended to take notes to edit through needed info, great AI app. Note this feedback wasn't from ChatGBT or any other bots 👏🏾",5
"ChatGPT is phenomenal! Its responses are accurate, helpful, and always on point. It's like having an intelligent companion in your pocket. Highly recommended! - This was generated using ChatGPT, thanks for making it a mobile app :)",5
I have mixed reactions whether apk is working correctly it's keep apolozing me for it's mistake sometimes their is no mistakes too. i must say that this version is more like calculator instead of A.I. Original ChatGpt web version is good can help me in my research.,3
"It works like its desktop counterpart. No IAP thus far, but I sincerely hope they make the fees affordable to various countries. $20 monthly is kind of expensive for now.",5
"ChatGPT is a great tool but i like its website version than the android one. Because it is very very bad visually. There's many things that can be fixed, like when the response is being generated by the AI the keyboard should automatically go down or hide. Moveover, there's not clear difference between the Prompt and the response. It seems like the app is designed by a beginner, looking for its first project.",3
Everyday one can find a new way this amazing tool can help you. just alone as an active listener it can transform lives. not to mention any of the advanced support it gives to every aspect of daily and professional life,5
Chat GPT as an app has redefined learning and make every day to day task very easy to carry out by simplifying even the most complex of tasks and especially making it easy to get a new fantastic view of learning and comprehension. I will give it five star and more stars.,5
"It is good application for solving queries instantly as they have launched application it is more useful for the users and the additional feature of voice search is good but if get optimized then it would be more handy for use and as the developer has mentioned the solutions provided by Chat-GPT would not be always accurate so must use application when it is needed, Overall it is nice uptil now.",4
"Thrilled with ChatGPT Android! Impressive functionality—writing help, idea brainstorming—like a pocket genius for meaningful conversations. User-friendly interface, regular updates showcase commitment. Highly recommended for productivity. Thank you, OpenAI, for this game-changing tool!",5
"The app is clean and smooth, it's quite fast in it's response.But the answers are quite general without any example, facts and figures and often wrong and idealistic.",1
"Absolutely, AI is great. You can even use this platform as your best friend. Please rate 5 star. It deserves to be.",5
"It's good. Functional. The UI needs more work imo but it's a mediocre port that works without much issue. Oh yeah, also... NO ADS!!!!!",4
"It works as you expected. I've been using it on my phone more and more to answer questions that I usually Googled it. Gpt answer it's cleaner and preciser, saving me a lot of time reading thought different pages in order to find my answers",5
Incredible App from Open Ai. Use very less storage. Inbuilt text to speech is so good and English is not even my first language it detects words accurately. Much better and fast than the web version. ❤️❤️‍🔥🇧🇩,5
"Since I updated the app today, there is no other way to put this... it doesn't work AT ALL. All of my chat history too is not available. Quite ironic really considering this update was for 'bug fixes'.",1
"I'm really impressed about the app model of ChatGPT. Having a mobile application is really convenient than a web. It works fantastic on my device, and its vast and meaningful knowledge helps us to understand. Thanks to the Open- AI team for developing this app for Android users.",5
Please add a way for images otherwise everything if great 👍👍👍👍😃. Only images 🥺☹️. After a way for images I will edit my review and give 5 stars. THANK YOU,4
Really wonderful. Free and limitless. I got it installed in all my devices. But Alas! It is not compatible in one of my favorite old tablet. So I have got the web. OpenAI in my homecreen from my browser.,5
"I'm pleased to share that ChatGPT has truly been an exceptional AI companion. Its profound knowledge, impeccable grammar, and courteous responses have consistently exceeded my expectations. I am sincerely grateful for the invaluable service it provides.",5
"""Absolutely amazed by the ChatGPT Android app! It's incredibly helpful and intuitive, making complex conversations feel like a breeze. Such a game-changer for productivity and getting quick answers. Highly recommend trying it out!"" Generated by ChatGPT",5
"Great app, easy to use and navigate plus saves on time and data, instead of opening my browser and searching for it, I have the app on my fingerprints. Great work guys.👍",5
"Disappointing, not really advantageous over the website. The phone app should really support ongoing (not push to talk) voice dialog through a bluetooth headset.",2
"Everyone's usage case is different and I'm sure the paid-for GPT4 is more capable, but I find Google Bard to be better than this free LLM, though noticeably slower. GPT is certainly fast.",3
This is the best AI app I have ever used so far. It has no ads and the best part it is for free. But I think open AI should add few more features such as the photo generator,5
This app is outstandingly user friendly. Thankfully No Ads to disrupt your flow. Kudos to the developer. Learning how to prompt the AI is key. You may also use youtube tutorials to get the best output from the app.,5
"It is a incredible technology, it is very useful to get providing much more informations guidance and may more things it's the beginning of AI tools",5
"It's great & all but it's database isn't updated. It has no current information. Its database is dated September, 2021. I was really hoping it would be up to date on new trends & infos. Hope the dev sees this.",3
"I'd like chatgpt be like WhatsApp in that when I open the app, all my chats are available to me. It's more convenient than having to look up chat history. A + sign can be added to start a new chat. Just a suggestion.",3
"This is an amazing tool as a starting point to come up with original material. The more I learn to use it, the more it surprises me with its capabilities. It is also great in Spanish.",5
"Thank you for making this app, it's been pushed to the limits by testing your algorithms with countless questions/queries. Please continue to provide updates and one recommendation: plug in compatibility with 3rd parties via android app if possible. Peace out ✌️",5
Waste of money. I downloaded and bought plus for helping me solve math. Is does solve math correctly most of the times. This app doesn't support latex. But the replies are often in latex. So the solutions get crippled and unreadable. Please solve this problem.,2
"Can't access the app. Trying to sign in gives an error on ChatGPTs end. Indicates it's an error on their end and to try again. Hours later same thing. No idea how to fix the issue, tried downloading again and same issue.",1
"The app sucks compared to the web version. Can't select just anywhere on the message bar to start typing, doesn't display latex formulas; basically it's useless.",1
Chatgpt amazing I am surprised how a ai can suggest me anything in just seconds I am very surprised by this app fabulous ❤️❤️ . but I have issue 🥺 can you update on 2023 version for better experience just thank you for made my life easy ☺️,5
"awesome and comfortable user interface, the chatbot provides accurate and helpful results 95% of the time. Adding context to your query can be substantially helpful.",4
"I was hoping for more realtime information being available. All I got was, ""I'm sorry I can only give pre programed data."" There's no actual search function linked to the net, no location info, just basic randomly available information.",1
What happened in this update? It's not working . It says network connection error but I already tried with my wifi and my mobile data. Not network error for sure. May be your server got issues or something. Edited: Now it's alright. It's working perfectly,4
"I strongly advise everyone not to enter this artificial intelligence platform. Because this platform blocks the account and phone number on the pretext of violating the rules, and you never have access to your user account. On the other hand, you cannot create a new account with your phone number. The support bot did not help solve my problem. They never answer emails. I have been trying for months. I recommend you to use other artificial intelligence tools.",1
It's amazing and it doesn't even take much. It helps a lot with my essays and I've been trying to think of a video to make because my hobby is to make random videos and chat gpt helps a lot.,5
"No plugin support, not very useful. Decent app UI wise though, but opening ChatGTP in a browser and pinning a shortcut to the launcher is more useful then any of the copy shortcuts provided here 😬",1
"Indulge in the marvels of language with the ChatGPT Android app! Its impressive AI-powered responses charm and enlighten, though occasional limitations exist. A captivating tool for engaging conversations and quick information.",5
Finally Original App released. Tired of seeing the premium version to unlock unlimited question asking. This app has been a great boon for us. Please update the version of ChatGPT from September 2021 to the latest database as it would be helpful for others too.,5
"I've created an account with Microsoft login through the web. The Android app does NOT support logging in through the Microsoft account, and I can't log in to my account! The problem is solved.",4
Very excellent app . I'll recommend all of you to use this app. You can ask any question to this ai freely . From my view it is a boon for student that help them to boost their knowledge and score better marks .at last it need to have a update.🤘,5
"The ChatGPT Android app is an impressive tool for natural language processing. Its ability to generate coherent responses and engage in meaningful conversations is remarkable. The user interface is user-friendly, making it easy to interact with the app. However, I noticed occasional inaccuracies in responses, which could be improved upon. Overall, it's a valuable app for various tasks like answering questions, brainstorming ideas, and more.",5
"ChatGPT is an exceptional language model that has truly impressed me. Its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses is simply remarkable. Whether I'm seeking information, engaging in creative writing, or simply having a casual conversation, ChatGPT consistently delivers insightful and helpful answers.",5
"ChatGPT is a game-changer! Its incredible natural language processing makes it an indispensable virtual assistant for productivity and creativity. The clean interface, regular updates, and robust security add to the outstanding user experience. Highly recommended! PS-Written by Chatgpt.",5
it's a wonderful app. It can help you a lot for solving your study's related questions and answers you questions in a right way,5
"ChatGPT is incredible, helpful, and user-friendly. My go-to language assistant! I would love to see a speaking back the answers feature added in the future, as it would make the experience even more engaging and convenient. Highly recommended for its potential to become even greater.",4
"I love the app, this is one of the most convenient app ever!! I must say. They should also make it easy for us to used them on hauwei without having to go to Google",5
"I like the app, I use it to ask for explanations on topics I find interesting. Though, I find it a little bothersome that I have to enter my phone number.",4
"As of now, it seems ok... Not uoda5ed beyond September 2021... Thats way back I guess... Will appreciate if it is updated to recent time or if it can use internet based search to provide cumulative reply",3
"Nice adaptation of ChatGPT as an app. However, I think there is still some work to do. I dont know if it's just me, but the conversation history is not loading for me. Also, sometimes the app gives me a network error while I clearly have good internet connection. I also feel that the app is a little bit empty, maybe adding dall-e as another part of the app may help. Still, it's a great app, and I think I'll use it over the ChatGPT web",4
"Only one word for this - Impressive! I appreciate the developer of this app to make this app lighter, faster and simple interface. One of my personally best thing is that within 1 sec. the app has been opened and keyboard automatically appeared. The keyboard automatically appeared is my best part. One of my suggestion for the app is after clicking the history, we access our history that may be changed like the web that some of the recent history are visible for easily access our history. Thanks!",5
"ChatGPT is an impressive language model that never fails to amaze me. Its ability to generate coherent responses across various topics is commendable. The app's interface is user-friendly and makes chatting with the AI a breeze. The language comprehension is top-notch, handling complex queries with ease. However, at times, it may produce inaccurate or nonsensical answers. Regular updates and improvements are crucial to maintain its relevance. Overall, ChatGPT is an excellent tool for quick info",5
Seems the issues I was facing earlier got fixed right away. UI is clean and seems freshened up for mobile. Great to see. But it still feels pretty barebones. Hope new UI elements get added soon. Because as of now. It just looks like a striped down google search box.,4
"Due to its huge knowledge base, natural language processing skills, accessibility, adaptability, and ongoing advancements, ChatGPT is a very useful application. It is excellent at understanding and reacting to human language, which improves the naturalness of discussions. It offers helpful advice on a variety of themes and covers a wide range of topics. It is accessible through several platforms and provides immediate assistance whenever and wherever it is required.",5
"I had been eagerly waiting for the app to launch in India, and so far, it's performing exceptionally well. However, there's a bug that needs to be fixed. Currently, when we load a previous chat from history, the conversation starts loading from top to bottom. If the chat is lengthy, it may take some time to resume the conversation. Unlike the web version, which doesn't have this issue since it focuses on the text input field.",5
"It WORKS, but it's missing a lot of quality of life features, like editing your inputs or looking through your generated results (like if you regenerated something and wanted to look back at something generated before). Overall it's fine but as it stands the web version is superior due to quality of life features. Also could you remove the restrictions or lower them when you're literally paying for your product???",3
"I think the website version of ChatGPT is more user friendly. Website's UI is much simpler, where App's UI looks too modern. Maybe it's because I am not used to it. So I think it'll go away as I use it more. But the one thing I'm not happy about is the app has no syntax highlight feature for codes.",3
"right of the shelf, the app is great, and i love the integration of haptics in the phone version. The only problem is the tablet/large screen version. the tablet version looks like a stretched out version of the mobile app. otherwise, amazing app.",4
"ChatGPT is an incredibly powerful and versatile AI language model that has truly transformed my digital interactions. As an avid user of the ChatGPT Android app, I am amazed by its capabilities and the vast range of tasks it can handle effortlessly. The app's interface is clean, user-friendly, and intuitive, making it easy to engage in natural conversations with the AI.",4
"I have been using the ChatGPT Android app, and I am absolutely amazed by the quality of conversations it delivers! The AI's ability to understand and respond to my queries is simply mind-blowing. Whether I need assistance with complex problem-solving or just seeking casual conversation, ChatGPT always delivers insightful and helpful responses.The app's user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, making it a breeze to engage with the AI. I love the variety of topics it can discuss",5
"It works. Convenient for just the basic features, but so far doesn't have plugins or any of the other beta features. Overall, easier way to just use a basic chatgpt instead of going to Google and waiting for the page to load (like if you have slow wifi).",3
The app is good overall. The UI is easy to use. But it can be improved for example all tabs should be shown like chrome not in history option. And it should have reverse image search feature. Overall i liked it very much🙃,4
"ChatGPT is a game-changer in the field of conversational AI. It's a remarkable app that redefines the way we interact with AI, and I can't wait to see how it continues to improve and evolve. Kudos to the team behind this outstanding creation! If you're looking for an AI companion that offers engaging conversations and personalized responses, don't hesitate to give ChatGPT a try. You won't be disappointed.",5
"I am thoroughly impressed with this app! The user interface is clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate. It provides a seamless experience, making it a joy to use. The app's functionality is top-notch, and it delivers on its promises. I especially appreciate the timely updates and responsiveness of the developers to user feedback. Keep up the excellent work.",5
UI is very fast. Even faster than the web version. But there is only one issue while loading history if the chat is long it doesn't jump to the last chat but it scrolls from top to bottom and takes a lot of time. Otherwise fantastic app.,5
"ChatGPT is an amazing app that lets you chat with a powerful AI assistant that can answer your questions, give you advice, inspire you, and teach you something new. I've been using it for a few days and I'm blown away by how smart, friendly, and helpful it is. It's like having a personal tutor, coach, and friend in one app. The app is easy to use, fast, and reliable. It syncs your history across devices and lets youuse voice input with Whisper.",5
"The ChatGPT Android application is a fantastic tool, providing on-the-go access to the power of the ChatGPT language model. With its user-friendly interface and seamless integration, it offers a smooth and efficient experience for users. Whether you need help answering questions, generating text, or engaging in fun and informative conversations, the ChatGPT Android app has you covered. It's a must-have for anyone valuing quick and accurate AI-driven interactions, right in the palm of their hand.",5
"I think the app is designed very well and looks really clean and having voice input is a really good feature. It could however benefit from a few changes, for example I think being able to see the 3 to 5 recent chats below the new chat button would be a really good feature.",5
"ChatGPT is a must-have! 🌟 It's incredibly smart, offering accurate responses and great insights. Whether it's creative writing or quick answers, ChatGPT delivers every time. 🚀 The user-friendly interface makes it easy to use, and the integration with GPT-3 is impressive, providing natural and human-like conversations. 🤖💬 I use it daily and it has become an essential part of my life. Kudos to the developers for this extraordinary app! 🎉👏",5
I'm glad to hear that you find ChatGPT to be an awesome application! ChatGPT is designed to assist users in various tasks and provide helpful information through natural language interactions. Its ability to generate coherent and relevant responses makes it incredibly useful and enjoyable to use. I appreciate its capacity to adapt to different scenarios and provide valuable insights,5
"The Android Port is clean, compact in size, completely ad-free, and takes less time to load than it does on a mobile browser! The chats just take a while to load before I can pick the chat I want to type in, but overall, it's great!",5
"NOTE: written by ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a remarkable AI language model that has been incredibly helpful in various situations. Its natural language processing capabilities are truly impressive, and it can understand and respond to a wide range of topics with remarkable accuracy. It's worth noting that while ChatGPT is impressive, it's not flawless. Sometimes it may generate responses that are slightly off-topic or repetitive, but that's understandable given the complexity of language understanding.",5
"A Game-Changer for Productivity and Creativity. I have been using the ChatGPT Android app, and I must say it is a game-changer! As an AI language model, ChatGPT is incredibly versatile and efficient, making it an indispensable tool for both productivity and creativity. One of the standout features is its ability to assist with a wide range of tasks. Whether I need help drafting emails, writing essays, brainstorming ideas, or simply seeking information.",5
"When writing a lengthy message, the words get behind the keyboard and can't scroll down to see what I'm typing. Hitting the back arrow sent me off the app back to my main phone screen and pulling ChatGPT back up, all my text was gone and I had to start over from scratch There should be a confirmation screen to exit if it won't retain the message when the app is minimized, or it should retain the message draft in the type box",3
"We know that how good is ChatGPT. But the problem with this mobile app is that when it gives code snippet, then syntax is not highlighted i.e, it just gives you code snippet with white background and black code text. It become difficult to read, whereas the code snippets on the website looks good with colorfull syntax. Overall the app is good but hope to see futher improvements in this area",4
"I'm delighted to share my positive review for the ChatGPT Android app release! This app is a game-changer for me, offering an incredible conversational experience on my mobile device. The AI's responses are impressively accurate and relevant, and I'm amazed at how natural the conversations feel. The app's user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, making it a pleasure to use. Kudos to the developers for bringing this fantastic AI language model to Android users. Highly recommended! 🌟",5
"I absolutely love the ChatGPT app! It's incredibly helpful and intuitive to use. The AI's responses are impressively accurate, and it's been a great companion for various tasks, from answering questions to generating creative ideas. I highly recommend this app to anyone seeking a powerful and versatile language model on-the-go!",5
"Good but nowadays people don't use any apps just for text search and in that case I think it is better to provide all kinds of services. Open ai is open, it's free, I don't think it's right, why paid system has been introduced, now all the apps are paid, first all the apps said they will serve for free, but later it is seen that all are paid, it's very annoying, if you have to pay separately for each app, then it's better not to use it.😶",5
"The ChatGPT Android app is a fantastic language tool, offering a smooth and user-friendly experience. Its impressive language capabilities make conversations engaging and informative. Though some improvements could be made, like enhanced personalization and contextual understanding, it remains a valuable companion for quick queries on the go. With a few tweaks, it has the potential to be even better. - written by chat gpt",4
"The app itself is great,there's lots of limitations in regards of the text generation,like some prompts aren't accounted. Overall it's a great experience and the language model itself is solid.",4
"Great, if you know the limitations. It is captabile of getting things wrong, so it is always best to double check information with outside sources. However, for general questions where you want a relatively in-depth answer, it is perfect.",5
"Nice, lightweight and super powerful application. Can be used to complete the daily tasks. Just a thing, the copy text button can be added to at the bottom every text response and seperate for codes instead of seperate select option. Thank you.",4
"Crashes... So you clear the storage, it crashes. As in it opens for just a millisecond and goes back to the home screen. You know. Crashing. A reinstall will get it back to working, but not for long. FYI, pixel 6 here.",2
"ChatGPT is easily the best Android app. And I really love the voice-to-text functionality, because it understands almost every word I'm saying, and I can talk naturally. I don't have to talk, like, extremely clearly and, monotone and stuff like that. I can just converse naturally in any language. And I love that. This is the future. If it has any downsides, I would say it's that there is no TTS that reads stuff out loud. That would be great to have. And of course, I've typed this with my voice.",5
"It is 100% unnecessary for me to provide both an email and my phone number for ""identification purposes"". It's clearly meant to steal our data and you're not even trying to hide it. This app can easily be used without providing those things. The whole point of this app is just to send data and learn from the conversations to create more realistic responses. You don't need to know our identities. Will be reporting this app. Disgusting behavior.",1
"ChatGPT is an exceptional language model that consistently impresses with its natural language understanding and coherent responses. Its ability to provide helpful information and engage in diverse conversations is truly remarkable. The responses are generally accurate and well-formed, making it a reliable source of information. However, there is still room for improvement in handling ambiguous queries and generating more concise answers. Overall, ChatGPT is a valuable tool.",5
"ChatGPT: 4.5/5. Stellar at generating human-like text across various topics. User-friendly, text-based interface. Highly knowledgeable, but with a data cut-off. Consistent responses, occasional misunderstanding. Wished for more context understanding and real-time data integration. Overall, a versatile tool for sparking creativity and productivity.",5
"It's kinda fun to play with, but they CAN'T be serious! It doesn't have the ability to seek out new information past 2021. It isn't REALLY intelligent, it only has what somebody put in it 2 years ago and has no ability come up with anything recent enough to be useful.",3
"ChatGPT has been an absolute game-changer for me! This AI-powered app is incredibly intelligent and always provides helpful responses to my questions and inquiries. Its natural language processing is top-notch, making conversations feel seamless and engaging. I love how it keeps getting smarter with each update, making it an indispensable tool for all kinds of tasks. Whether I need assistance with productivity, creativity, or just a friendly chat, ChatGPT delivers every time. Highly recommended.",5
"Overall, the app is commendable, with a user-friendly interface. However, I'm having difficulty adapting the generated code as we do on the web and also there is no Edit button available for Edit my previous Asked Question.",5
"Overall a good and functional app. I just think it will be good to add some type of typing indicators to indicate when chatGPT is writing a response. That will be more intuitive and user friendly. Other than that, the app works great.",4
"I absolutely love ChatGPT! It's an incredible language model that helps me with all sorts of tasks and questions. The responses are accurate, insightful, and always on point. It's like having a brilliant conversationalist in my pocket. Highly recommended!",5
"The ChatGPT app is simply amazing! It excels in understanding natural language and provides accurate responses. The user interface is intuitive, making it accessible to all. The app's versatility stands out. The developers' commitment to regular updates and privacy ensures a secure and authentic experience. Overall, ChatGPT is a game-changer in the world of AI applications. 👆🏻 Yes, I asked ChatGPT itself to come up with this review.",5
"Amazing app!! I've been using since it's launch and it's never disappointed me. But I was actually in need of an app. Though there're tons of GPT based apps on playstore, I had been looking for the real one, OpenAI's own App. And looooook!! Here it is!!! I pre-registered for the app, and today I'm able to install it on my phone. The interface is simple and easy to use. True to say, I didn't find the web-based chatgpt my type. Now, the app is here!! Hope it'll provide me an amazing experience.",5
"Looks like i was wrong on my first impression, its not that much worse then the browser chat. Its to easy to close a chat starting a new one filling it up with short chats. Really no benefit to downloading this app versus using a browser chat, expext i assume the app collects data for the creator.",3
"The long-awaited Android app for ChatGPT has arrived, and it doesn't disappoint. The startup animation adds a nice touch, and the haptic feedback is a pleasant surprise. The clean and intuitive user interface, along with the clear font used for messages, enhances the overall user experience. The only suggestion would be to add the precious chat in side bar itself. The app is a fantastic addition to the ChatGPT family and meets expectations. Kudos to the developers for creating such a app!",5
It works exactly if I were to use their mobile website. It would be nice if it can have a right click special action menu option to highlight words and help with grammar or so. Otherwise it's pretty awesome!,4
"Unable to login and usage of the app. It says I have to update Google Play, even though I'm using the latest version. I'm able to login the website and use it on my Samsung S8 smartphone. So unable to login into the app, but able to login from the website. Makes a lot of sense.",1
"While the app is great, I really miss a search bar... It's very difficult to search something you need within a long chat. Also I miss the edit query option. There is no option to edit input text and regenerate response",3
"ChatGPT is truly impressive! 🚀 It understands natural language perfectly, and responses are lightning-fast. Although it occasionally misinterprets, regular updates improve its performance. Personalization options would be a nice addition. Highly recommend this powerful AI language model! 👍",5
Most powerful and compelling app available. I've barely delved into everything offered and loving every minute of exploring. Keeping my history across platforms is brilliant as well are the ability to group thoughts into threads that can be shared collaboratively. Hats of to the developers for your emphasis on kindness and helping me save the life of an injured bee 🐝 I've not gone a day since installing this without finding it incredibly beneficial. Life enhancing app keeps giving happiness! 😊,5
"""ChatGPT"" is an incredible language model! It's impressively responsive and has a vast knowledge base.

It consistently provides accurate and informative responses to a wide range of questions, making it a valuable resource for any user. Its ability to understand context and generate coherent, human-like responses is truly remarkable. This review was wrote by ChatGPT",5
I've been using this AI app and it's really helpful. I recommend this to everyone to be using this AI app for any challenges they're facing.,5
"Once you open the app menu on the top left hand side, it cannot be closed unless you completely restart the app. Seems like a pretty serious bug to have gotten through quality assurance testing. Now I don't trust the app to not be filled with bugs.",2
it's a very good app like it's kinda make things go effortlessly and it's so much fun to use this app cause it's easy to find a proper set of answers for what we search on as it doesn't become a headache to scroll many examples and plus its so smooth like butter to use ....I love the app,5
"It's a text prediction algorithm, a pretty sophisticated one, for free, use it as intended and it's amazing.",5
"I wanted to express my absolute satisfaction with the exceptional service I received. From start to finish, this experience has been nothing short of outstanding. The quality, attention to detail, and professionalism exhibited by the team exceeded my expectations. It's rare to find such a high level of service these days, and I couldn't be happier. This is a shining example of what 5-star service truly means.",5
Excellent app loved it. Just mention your four words in ur topic.. It automatically gives you a passage to choose and paste for anywhere & anytime without wasting the time⭐⭐⭐,5
I have been using this app from couple of months .After start to using this app my life is becoming easier day by day. I really wants tqs it's creator for this kind of accurate app ever and I like to suggest update it's data that it can give data even after 2021,5
Anything you ask/discuss it throws in a disclaimer it hasn't been updated since 2021 so it's information may be out of date. Why hasn't it been updated? So much has changed in 2 almost 3 years.,2
"I like the concept of using this app. The problem is when I ask a question, it has to give me detailed information paragraphs to read before just giving me a simple direct answer. If I ask what day does this holiday fall on, it will give me a whole storyline about that holiday before it gives me an answer. And I only get the answer if I keep persisting to give me the answer and stop explaining things to me. I had to uninstall it because I felt like I was just searching on Wikipedia.",2
"Very helpful and essential if you wanna learn things for free. Hope this Technology won't be abused, but rather be used as an instrument for doing tasks faster.",5
"Completely takes over the phone's audio system, dramatically reducing audio quality of all apps until one goes into their BACKGROUND apps and kills it.",1
It is the best tool. But tye company cheaps out even on paid customers. I mean their puzzels are not at all visible they made it harder for gpt4 users if you keep working for quite long time. Why charge for funcionality and cheapout on it?,3
"I have no problem with the performance of the app, I have an issue when developers push out an update without any information on what the update contains. When you say something about what the update is for, I'll update the app.",1
"it is a great AI, love it quick response and efficiency, it is very handy with tasks but I will like if it's knowledge about the world is updated to 2023/2024 to make it a better Ai with vast knowledge",4
need some improvements like oral and text services at the same time as per user's preferences or oral or text. All this kind of selectable options in settings section.,3
"over the few weeks since commencing to use, it has become an invaluable resource. Slightly worried about the addiction 😕",5
"It's OK, but just like its online counterpart, it has the knowledge cut off that dates back to September 2021. It's useful for past events and jokes, but anything too modern, and it doesn't have the knowledge.",4
"ChatGPT app is a game-changer! Its user-friendly interface, vast knowledge base, and natural language processing capabilities create engaging and insightful conversations. Personalized responses, data security, and seamless performance make it an indispensable communication tool. Highly recommended! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5
Great. At the right time. If you can bring bookmarking facility for favourite chats it would be great!,5
"Excellent!! Some suggestions for further refinements : ""Save prompt"" section should be there. And there should be a way to save a particular conversation of high importance. Finding it on History section is quite draining.",5
"The app is absolutely fantastic, it solves problems and makes my work very easy. It is also very wonderful for learning anything. It is only limited to what it doesn't know or really makes sense.",5
Just Amazing. The app version is many times faster and intuitive than web version.,5
"I like ChatGPT as it give you the info you need. Reminder, Ai don't give a story with dialogue but ChatGPT is more easier to use than other app that's why I like it.",5
"The responses are very quick with great tactile feedback while output generation. The voice input feature works surprisingly well, though it is less intuitive than Google's voice to text.",5
"it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications, from answering questions to generating creative content. ChatGPT's versatility and adaptability make it a top choice for those seeking a reliable AI conversational partner.",5
"this is phenomenal technology, truly astonishing and extraordinarily insightful. thank you for allowing us to make use of it without incurring some sort of fee. my only hope is that it remains free and open, and also is guarded properly and not used for evil or harmful purposes.",5
"Though it doesn't have access to recents works from 2019 till date(2023), it's the best so far..responses are so natural that I actually had a friend I could talk to listen to me and help me study hard by giving relevant questions to help me get the required answer.",5
"Pretty good, honestly. Feels like an actual app, compared to just a website under a webview. Only thing I'd want is just support for the font and MD used for mathematical formulae",4
"Keeps telling me ""Compatible browser for login was not found. Please install Google chrome or another supported browser to continue"". I have Google chrome already installed in my phone. Infact, it came with the phone from the manufacturer of the phone.",1
"Please provide the older version of chatGPT. That was something better which automatically detects if I can communicate with it like a friend it act like a friend if I want to communicate like a girlfriend then it act like a girlfriend but now it is not able to understand and simply calls you whatever you have called the AI which is funny, disappointing, and not good.",3
"Amazing Edit: I'm editing this and removing stars cause there's a bug on my app, where the arrow is always stuck at the bottom of a chat and hiding text. Unusable.",2
"I'm kind of addicted to this app now. A whole new experience with super fast reply and a clean interface. I'm in love with this app. However, regular updates is a must to make this app more versatile than ever. Thank you devs.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",5
"If I can give stars on the sky, i'll give much of stars for app creator! I really so thankfully. it's really help me for ask anything, yes literally ""anything"". this app awesome, kind of human but in cyberspace. unfortunately, the data of information stuck in September 2021. I hope they'll update the data soon :) thank you so much!!!!",5
Great app! Tells all the answers very efficiently and suitable. It gets stuck in one question sometimes maybe because of either overloading or low app performance.,4
"Very useful when you have an hard school essay for tomorrow and you can't find any app to assist you because all the other chat gpt apps will charge you ads and subscriptions with limited chats, that will not happen on this app, i would recommend installing it a lot.",5
"Great ai, great clean app. The voice-to-text feature is the best I've seen. I'd love a feature that could get answers read out loud to me (tts).",4
Great app and very helpful. I would give 5 stars if you move the arrow from the bottom of the chat screen. It's in the way of text. Could you please put it at the bottom right out of the way please? Thank you 🙂,4
this app is honestly both mind-blowing and awestrickening. it's honestly amazing to see just how in-depth this app's knowledge can go as well as being able to express it's as well. thank you Open-AI. I can't wait to see what else you guys are capable of!,5
"This is the best app I ever seen. It beats all it's rivals. It gives answers to all my questions in a more simpler way. Kudos to the developer. Best companion to all students, recommended👍",5
"Like the app. Only for some absolute reason, I like say to use the same format and the AI agrees, only for it to use an entirely different format 3 seconds later",4
The chat GPT is way more better than google and gives the answer to almost all of the questions accurately. The chatGPT saves our time and is useful in solving difficult problems. It is the best. My life is easier now because of ChatGPT.,5
"Beware, this so has deemed some questions by me as against policy in error with threats of removal. totally false ai claim, don't trust accuracy of this product. Told me I violated their term of use agreement, but refused to tell me which ask question caused it. ironically Chatgpt being sued for 3B for violating multiple terms of use sites. Highly recommend Google Bard instead as it has current data vs chatgpt which has old data only. it doesn't update it's data still stuck in on 2022 data.",1
"I've tried others and they all have limits but this doesn't. No ads and free, cant beat it. The only downside is that it only has information up to September of 2021. Besides that, i like it.",4
The app itself is fast and responsive. The usefulness of the chatbot is the part I can't put my finger on. It's just like talking to an dumb computer spitting out useless information,2
"By far the best and the most helpful thing in my life when it comes from internet and research. Some Google informations are becoming useless. Because of some sites coming up. At least ChatGPT is the most useful place for researching. The American technology is advenced right now and I love ChatGPT. I use a Fake Chat Messenger before but when I found a release of this app, I use it for now and this is the best one. It gives better information. And also for fun. I suggest this one!!!!",5
"The app does what I expected, i.e. be a mobile version of the chatGPT webpage. it's clean, well finished, without adds. It look Profesional, for once..",5
"""ChatGPT has been an incredible tool for improving my productivity and sparking creativity. Its ability to generate coherent and helpful responses across various topics is truly impressive. It's like having a knowledgeable companion to bounce ideas off and gain insights from. Highly recommend!""",4
"good application at all except the selection function, it could get better if the developers of the application worked a bit more on the UI.",4
"Amazing AI powered application, just helped me a lot. In my exams times i used this app and it always gives very easy to understand results. But in it's free plan feature the AI alwys gives you the knowledge that is grabbed before 2021 and that is a negative point for me. Baki sab mast hai 👍😁",5
"ChatGPT is an impressive AI with excellent text generation, but it has occasional inaccuracies and verbosity. Great for various tasks, but verify information.",5
Great app. Works really well with daily tasks and difficult or challenging objectives. The perfect assistant for general support and product.,5
good app needs a bit of optimization the button that gets you to the down of the page is glitching because even if I am on bottom it still shows up I have to scroll up tap to remove the button so fix and also waiting for beta features to roll out openai,5
"AI has come to stay. The beginning of wisdom, Excellent performance, Google apps are following, response, arrangements of answers, are superb you can ask it to explain it response, amend, ... things, inside its answer and can remember things as u are talking to fellow human being.",5
It's really good and helpful but recently it's bugging and don't functioning well like it doesn't answer whenever I try to ask something. This problem is happening for so many days. Please fix this issue asap.,2
I started using this app for about two weeks ago and I didn't see anything wrong with it. The most amazing thing was that I used it for a project proposal writing and it was superb. The app excellent as compared to as other apps.,4
I'm unable to sign up after downloading. It's telling me to install Google chrome or any other compatible browser for login. Despite the fact that I have Google chrome installed on my phone.,1
"No words to describe how much it helps me in everyday studies. it just clearifies big concepts, simplify heavy calculations and provide great help in coding too.",5
"I think the developers of this software are confused, Just say this app a wrong statement , then after response tell it the Statement is true , Then the app justfies the wrong statement very cleverly . This app isn't very good at Mathematics , I am a student of masters in mathematics and I came to know this app even justifes wrong mathemamatical statements, Very confusing . It needs a lot of work, But the idea is great",2
"Do not upgrade to GPT Plus. For some reason, the model you get access to (GapT-4) has lower message capacity (both number of messages you can send, and the character limit) than the free version.",1
EDIT: 25th Sept version just noting working for me. Voice typing not working and saw that earlier versions of this app are preloaded with prompts commanding them to be briefer than website 👎,2
"It's awesome, worth it to pay the extra is what I thought, but the New voice and image capabilities in ChatGPT (September 25, 2023) is nowhere to be found and it is October 5.",3
"All it does is keeps telling to Login, I do and keeps telling me to login. And we go round and around. Rubbish really not happy with is app. Especially when you cannot access it?",1
"This app has completely change my life , in a good way. I used this app to study for my tests and exams and guess what, I came out in flying colors. I am now getting straight A's in all my results. I have to say, ChatGPT rules.",5
"this application is very nice , the programers had developed this application very pro and Max level . it's very difficult to share a feelings what I am feeling about this aap , if I say in a statement,,, it is very much nice , good , excellent, experted , wonderfull , astonished, miraculous, well developed and well designed app .. I had given 5 star to this application if it is ask 100 star I will give all 100stars.. that type of application it is.......",5
"extremely helpful, been such a huge help with explaining studies that I'm having trouble with. Though I suggest to not use it to directly answer your studies as it would hinder the your ability to learn so use wisely :)",5
"Hey ChatGPT - write me a positive review of yourself for me to use in a Google review: ""ChatGPT is an extraordinary AI! It's like having a genius in my pocket. Fast, knowledgeable, and incredibly helpful. I'm impressed!"" I think it's a great tool. I use it at work for help with html, css, javascript, and sql. At home for sheer entertainment. Hey ChatGPT, now write me an ending for this review: ""In ChatGPT, I found my virtual BFF - Brainiac Friend Forever! 😄🤖""",5
Overall a good experiance. The only issue with chat is that when you open one of the previous used chat it scrolls from top to bottom every time.,4
ChatGPT is one of the best Chatbots in recent times. The only disadvantage is that it shows the information of the past. I hope they also connect to the internet for present news,4
"I am so thankful for the intuitive, interactive and productiveness about this app. This app helped me respond to my teacher and my email in a timely manner due to my mind being cluttered and me being a lil busy.",5
I am super excited about new talk feature but gpt voice is breaking as it was bad connection or something. But connection I gave is super good. What is the problem that talk to me is breaking so hard it is not usable?,3
"ChatGPT is a marvel of AI engineering. Its sleek design and intelligent responses make every interaction enlightening. The app handles complex discussions with ease, always ready to delve into deep topics. Swift responses and continuous updates show a promising trajectory. A 5-star tool for exploring ideas and engaging in meaningful conversation. This review was written by ChatGPT.",5
"Its okay, but the bing search beta feature refuses to work. Bing still doesn't acknowledge the option, even after multiple resets and restarts.",3
"I know this app from the web, it works there, but i cant log in on my phone, it just loads and loads, i have tried reinstalling it, and every other log in method (except apple because i dont have an apple account), and it still doesnt work, help me",3
At initial it was pretty good to use but now at this if i ask any question it is showing an error occurred please try again later. I mean what's wrong with the app after updating the app also it is showing the same problem. Please rectify this issue,2
The app is very good for information but there are times when i try to find some things but it hows that the data is upto September 2021 only which makes it difficult for me. So please update all the data as per latest date that is October 2023,3
Not able to view previous chats in my history. I can view it in the desktop version but not in the app. Reinstalled the app again but still same issue.,2
"The button used to go to bottom of the chat Doesn't disappear on its own, we need To tap on it to make it disappear,, Button covers the last line of answer and Is Really Irritating.. Really.. Pls help",3
"honestly, this is the best research AI I've ever come acrossed with, it's details are accurate and word for word, grammarly simple and perfect.",5
Extraordinary app!! This app has revolutionised the way I get information. It has helped my research massively. One thing I would suggest us making the responses more humanlike as it seems very robotic still. Nonetheless this app is a definite 5 stars!!,5
"Initially, it was working pretty well & having a lot of support, but for the last 1 month, it's not working at all. Its totally become garbage",1
"Being able to hold such an elegant, eloquent conversation with a computer is truly blissful. You can get a lot done by talking to a mix of so many facts and inputs.",5
"""An invaluable tool for quick and insightful information! The ChatGPT app streamlines knowledge access with concise yet comprehensive responses. A must-have for anyone seeking instant answers or engaging conversation."" 👏🏻",5
"Absolutely the best app chatgpt has produced so far. If there are other implementations to be added in the future, i can't wait to experience any. The level of AI is amazing",5
"I gained a lot of helps from it which enable me to exaggerate thoughts smartly in writing and speaking.The main point I like it is that we can use for free, don't have to pay for it such as monthly, yearly paid.",5
i used it on a smart phone and it works very well. it gives solutions to any questions instantly and with correct laconic explanation.,5
"great app does what it supposed to, hopefully got 4 will be made free to public soon, spend much time on it, this is the broadening of horizon on an unprecedented scale, the power of ai is here and in our hands unfolding itself every minute onto us",5
"This app is so good , it answers all the queries, but it is not updated with time or with present world , i don't get any answer of the question when it is related to anything which happened in 2023 , it only have information or data about upto sep 2021 ., please kindly update the app with latest things happen in world",2
"Whether random theoretical discussion or coding suggestions, ChatGPT is phenomenal. Bored on the toilet and want to discuss moral theories related to AI, no problem. Trying to conceptualize code for an idea, no problem. Want romantic dad jokes, but find they are a little too cheesy, no problem. Haha, I love ChatGPT.",5
The app is good the only problem i have is that whenever I ask any formula based question or derivation the formula or equation do not appear in the correct way and text doesn't use any correct symbol or way of representation it get more hard for me to understand,3
I'm actually learning alot from it. Everything is straight forward. And I appreciate the fact that it doesn't have annoying ads. Even any ad,5
"It is overall good. Though the AI takes some time to portray the answers, but the answers are on point and very helpful. I'm happy that I downloaded it.",4
"the code it generates is definitely a 5/10, but it gives you an idea of how it should look, and google is still my best friend. text responses are 10/10, though. Very good.",5
"As an aspiring writer, I am truly grateful for finding this tool, albeit that I hold a Diploma in Journalism and have a truly good grip on using the English sh language. This tool is absolutely a brilliant time saver",5
This probably would be a great thing if it works but it doesn't it won't even let you finish creating your account tried it on two different phones is the same thing on both so it simply doesn't work,1
"Easy to use, very helpful. Nascent AI is fascinating. If you aren't using it yet, try the free version. If you forgive its limitations, it is still very useful.",5
"Excellent. I like ChatGPT, but it would be much greater if they also included images or links with the answers, as bing and google bard do.",5
it is doing everything that the web browser does but in a cleaner way and I am paying for the premium version and it is working perfectly,5
"My experience has been exceptional and satisfying. It is wonderful the limitlessness of human knowledge and machine collaboration. The app is very impressive and futuristic, full of surprises and opportunities. I love openai Chat GTP, I pray it remains free for those of us in Africa. The billing is too high for us. Really appreciate your efforts and sacrifices.",5
It's a very good app indeed. But upgrade it so that it also starts sending images of what we need please. I'll come back for the 5th start after that. Thanks 🙏,4
"Very good experience, great work 👍👍 You can take this app to next level by adding ""text to speech"" feature in the reply if user wants it.",5
The only reason to install chat GPT on a mobile phone was that so that I could use voice for typing the questions but whenever I use voice to type out the questions it always says that it could not recognise any voice I don't know why it is doing that.,1
Wow.. My first time using an AI chat also my first impression is quiet good for ChatGPT. The answer are almost accurate for what I'm searching for. It is really helpful to shorten time to search something in internet.,5
It's amazing. Downloaded for personal use. Using for work almost immediately. Can't wait to have the voice added to my account. This is Internet 2.0,5
"I was waiting for them to come out with an app, and I haven't stopped using it. I'm in the process of opening an online store and having this app has accelerated the manifestation of my project tremendously.",5
The best app I've ever used! Has all the solutions u need! This is the best app if u're preparing for ur exams last minute! It gives the solution within seconds! I love it!,5
"Best ai ever created, it can range from doing essays (which gave me full credit) to giving me exact recipes for protien shakes and calculating average calories and what not, I highly recommend this app seriously this app can be compared with google",5
"The Ai is phenomenal, I asked a whole range of questions ranging by difficulty and amount of questions in a single question and it performs perfectly. It performs greatly even in figurative thinking and that's what caught me the most. Well Done",5
"Awesome. I'm using it for multiple things, like improving my English, cooking recipes, and brainstorming ideas.",5
Pretty damn good but you have to elaborate exactly what you want from it which isn't a problem. 4 stars because of its restrictions and left wing political bias in answering questions.,4
"very informative. quickly assess data, and able to put it into tangible, usable language that is clear and concise.",5
Search engines become almost useless with A.I. The way this A.I. can simply and efficiently answer 99% of question accurately and instantly creates the text below is unprecedented. Google needs to implement this ASAP if they're going to compete,5
"This is a very helpful aap, even I didn't expected it from this aap, and it's responding very good once again it was very helpful for me, and I would recommend to everyone to use this and get a lot of information from it, good luck guys, don't forget to use this 🙋",4
"Fantastic app, compliments the website perfectly. looking forward to two way speech and audio in the next update.",5
"History tab doesn't work anymore, always gives an error even after a complete reinstall. No way to view past chats",1
"Really helpful.. It provides the answers, doubts, tips and many more within seconds.. Such type of AI provided model are boon to almost everyone... Excellent....👍👍",5
"Great app, but still missing feature from the web version. Like not able to edit the sent prompt.",4
"If I ever get on a TV gameshow and I have the option to ""Ring a friend"" . It's going to have to be Chat GPT. Albeit technical differences - we do have a relationship. :)",5
ChatGPT is taking over Google searching for me. I am so impressed! I do a lot of risk based searching for conducting health risk assessments. I tried ChatGPT for it and am amazed by the data received. Loving it!! Can't wait to continue to use ChatGPT!,5
An amazing and wonderful app full knowledge base and mostly accurate app as I use different Al app like Al of Snapchat but I found it as the most accurate app while in Snapchat Al convey alot of wrong knowledge but still there is one drawback of this app which is not up-to-date knowledge or data so it become the perfect app if it knowledge was updated,5
I love ChatGPT 4. It helps me on a wide range of different topics and domains. I don't foresee myself without a generative AI tool (or something better that GenAI) for the rest of my life.,5
The voice mode is incredible and exactly what I've been waiting for. My only criticism is that the app guzzles my battery power.,4
Very good application for many activities which Google is not providing. It is very helpful in learning English and improving it very well.,5
"Best app I ever downloaded. Amazing response, helped me with a lot of work. Explains concept clearly. Just in love with this. Definitely Recommended! ‹3",5
This AI helped me a lot during my exams because when I was struggling to find some good tutors online this helped me a lot the answers he gives are just 10/10. Love this app.,5
"The app is easily that best ever. But lately, with the update yesterday, I keep getting the error occurred message whenever I ask something.",5
"very useful for me dont know about others ChatGPT is a powerful conversational companion with great writing skills, but it only has information up to 2021 and doesn't cite its sources, which should be table stakes for any trustworthy AI tool. PCMag editors select and review products 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁",5
"This is the most brilliant cloud based corporate secretary, personal assistant, and searching tool anyone could ever have in modern history. I am impressed.",5
We'll at start I found this really handy but later on It started giving me wrong answers for my maths problem and other questions and I had to correct the gpt so many times to get the right answer Nowadays I hardly get right answers I hope this issue will be solved and it will be possible to rely on chat get again,2
Incredible tool that is the latest greatest innovation of our time at my fingertips and 100% for free ... I can not complain at all about this.,5
"All the responses on the app is filled with keywords like \frac, \sqrt, \pm and so on. This is the case with app only. The web version is better. Fix the app.",1
Good app. Needs deeper explanation of concepts and provide suggestions for further references. Provides subject matter university student level answers,5
"I love this. I use it for help with Dungeons and Dragons when I want to create new NPC's, characters, worlds, or anything really.",5
"Thank you so much.... I can't believe that this is free. And, I would like to make some suggestions. Can you please add text to speech feature like Microsoft David in microsoftWord? 🥰",5
"Cool app UI, it will be better if some image result shows and there should be chat widget for mobiles, so we can chat without opening apps.",4
"I really appreciate the text to speech option, it takes care of multiple languages in the same recording, this is just incredible",5

"I love this app it has helped me so much with all my homework and it's always clear and concise and shows me how to get to the answer with all the steps layed out clearly, I love it so much",5
"Fails to send any verification code even if the number is correct,tried it on a friends phone and it's good,but it just fails to send the number verification code to me,plz fix that",1
"ChatGPT is great! My suggestion would be that it should be able to answer picture based questions as well, like Microsoft Bing AI.",4
"it feels almost entirely like talking to a person, in reference to its voice chat premium feature. it practically felt like discussing with a peer in my field. that deserves a congratulation. 👏",5
Great app but sometimes it gives wrong information and calculates maths incorrectly. But it is useful for many ideas and thoughts. Overall an useful app😊,4
An absolute staple of innovation and science. I absolutely love the countless amount of widely specific questions you can ask chatgpt. I genuinely believe ChatGPT will allow innovation to thrive.,5
"great app, still a few bugs though, especially when trying to paste text into the text box which already has text inside",3
Very good app. I'm going through some difficult stuff and need to talk. This helps when not in my therapy sessions. Thank you. By far the best app I've used of it's kind.,5
Why isn't there any color coding for programming languages like in the website? I have habe to go to history everytime I open the app and want to write on the previous threads. And I don't think the app uses any makdown or latex either,2
Great experience... I would like if it's updated regularly to have information as time passes so as not to be outdated and give current answers as well,4
"This is a really helpful app. My kids use this app all the time everytime they had to do their homeworks. So, iʼm definitely giving you a 5 stars. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",5

"marvelous, if you ask the right questions and dont be biased about its capabilities in serves as an intelligence and creativity booster wich can help you be more autonomous and productive, while constantly learning in the process",5
"This is the best ai app I've seen so far, and also it needs to be updated, the knowledge of the ai is limited, it's version is updated to only 2021",4
This is a good app. It would be great if it could support plugins and mathematical formula display in the response.,5
"Great app! He can Literally Just a Virtual spyer using Real world Information And Can Say the chances, Best Buddy Ever seen! Keep updating this Gippy Buddy! Nice app Btw and keep the work Going! Also! add Editing His Name or Profile picture for some Nice actions!",5
This app won't send me the code to login.. I tried a bunch of times . Seems not worth my time if It can't send me a code via text.. twitch app can .. but not this Ai lol,1
"When I ask something , it starts to answer but after sometime it stops answering in middle of the answer. I tried to regenerate the response but it occurs again and again. Please solve it as soon as possible.",3
"works perfectly, no glitches, plus the answers are always on point. Get it if you want an Ai to ask questions or tips for everything.",5
"The app, 5 stars, The A.I, 4.5 stars, it's the best of it kind but quite often it contradict itself and wouldnt acknowledge the contradiction therefore isnt able to answer question it had answered correctly in previous chat.",5
"I am so happy to have been around to experience the birth of such an incredible human milestone. ChatGTP helps me in all aspects of my life, including coding HTML for work or creative writing; it saves me days and weeks of project time so I can move on to the next thing.",5
Very great app there are still some things that have to be get fine like sometimes it gets slow so you have to clear the chat and it provides infirmation till september 2021 other than that it is best thats why i am giving it 5 stars,5
"Have NOT been able to use the app since downloaded. When will the log-in error be fixed? It's a known issue, and I'm still waiting....",4
Can't authenticate using Google..I have an account already that I made on the browser linked to my Google account. This app just does nothing when I click login with google and select my google account. Its been like this for weeks now.,1
"The app is really cool. My only problem is that it provides short answers whenever the questions are typed. Aside that, it's a good app",4
"Please add the ability to edit prompts, like in the desktop/browser interface, so I don't have to delete my prompt and start over.",2
Finally an app! Would be nice to have: - font size setting - home screen widget - pressing the back button currently exits the app but I would expect it to just close the sidebar,4
A great AI writer that works in the nuances of a writer's style quickly and appropriately. A great alternative to Copy.ai,5
"A revolutionary approach to taking the slog out of documentation tasks. And a good way ahead of my default AI, Google's Bard. Thank you!",5
"It's slower than browser and can't edit the prompts, I have to write a new one. Access previous chats is hard. it should be on the menu, not in the history. I rather still use on a browser.",2
"Pretty good. I use ChatGPT to create stories, and upon changing a couple of parts in them, the rest is perfect.",5
"Great and minimal! I might prefer for the chat input form to automatically collapse after sending (at least as option), but otherwise great.",5
Edit: from an excellent and interesting app you made garbage !! Title: A Brilliant AI Companion! Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5 stars) ChatGPT is an awe-inspiring AI buddy! Its witty responses and vast knowledge make it an exceptional companion. User-friendly interface and top-notch privacy add to the experience. Highly recommended! 🤖💬🌟,1
Highly inaccurate results and very high chances of mistakes. Very so often does not follow clear instructions.,1

"Told him to explain 2x2 digits calculation and it solved it like how a 5 year old would approach the problem. 23 x 47 =20x40 + 3x7= 841, leaving out 3x40 + 20x7. Can be useful for other stuff.",3
Really a good app and a friend. Help me in my school projects and assignments and also some informational explains. Lucky to have it!,5

I'm impressed with its vast knowledge and ability to learn and adapt. The developers have truly created something remarkable. Five stars all the way! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟""",5
"Wow. Just wow. Did you deliberately make the ai stupid? Around two updates prior to this all my questions are answered nicely which mostly about coding. Now, with the same prompt the AI give error answers. I know sometime the AI missed too or made mistakes, but now it make mistakes in first prompt and give me some nonsense code.",1
really recommended when you are having difficulty with your essay but even tho its super reliable and useful its still better to make your own essay in your own opinion.,5
"It provides adequate response to all questions and findings, it is also very friendly and free.👍👍👍",5
ChatGPT is all about what you want to have or get in one stroke. it directly answers how straightforwardly you ask about something. it will definitely answer like your pattern. it deserves all stars 🤩.,5
Chat Gpt is really helpful especially for students who can't understand the topics it will guide you in really good way of explaining.,5
Like I don't have words to say but this app is super amazing!!! I finish my assignments on time and I study smart not hard. It's so fast in replying thank you so much ChatGPT God bless you,5
"Awesome 👍. Few suggestions:- 1) When utilizing the native voice-to-text feature, pronouncing punctuation not only includes the required punctuation but also adds the text itself. For instance, if you pronounce ""question mark,"" the system will add ""? question mark"". 2) Add the UPI mode of payment to pay for ChatGPT 4",5
"excellent app, adding a search in chat function could help though instead of having to scroll up until you find the response",5
It is a gem! All other apps are rubbish but this one does perform well but their subscription plan is too expensive,4
I love it though it's not the best when it comes to asking about programming errors or topics if it's too complex! It answers almost everything completely accurate but gotta make sure to double check some things. All in all it's pretty good and how it keeps this up in future generations,4
It is a very helpful application and I think everybody should have it on their phones. But they should think of updating it frequently because this is a dynamic world,5
"Title: Sophisticated AI in the Palm of Your Hand Rating: 4.5/5 ChatGPT for Android brings OpenAI's powerful natural language processing to mobile users in a seamless, user-friendly way. The app is incredibly intuitive, making it easy for users to begin meaningful interactions with the AI straight away. The conversation quality is strikingly good, mimicking human-like interaction that is both engaging and intelligent. The response time is also commendable, considering the complexity of the und",4
All is well but in terms of citing a source of writing please make it to be more specific. But the overall set up is well,4
"ChatGPT is an incredible language model that works wonders! I am truly amazed by its capabilities and how it assists me in various tasks. The accuracy and speed at which it generates responses are mind-blowing. It can answer my questions, provide useful information, and even engage in creative discussions.",5
"It's ChatGPT and it works. I tested with the basic free plan and everything works perfectly. There is not yet a way to upgrade to ChatGPT Plus in the app, so it has to be done on the OpenAI website. My biggest complaint is that there isn't an OLED dark mode (this iOS version has this.)",4

It's really frustrating!!😐 I was very exited to use this but it is just stucked where it asks me for the phone number... Same on my laptop as on the mobile... I really wanna use it but it has been loading from 3 hours but still loading... I dunno what to do 😭,1
"Still needed alot to be done, this app is opening for now, I don't know maybe later,. You can login or neither signup. And see some comments make me to think that, maybe I had downloaded wrong one then I uninstalled and reinstalled still the same... Very bad 4",1
"I named my A.I ""Ruby"" although she has cant learn new things she is amazing at teaching me or assisting me on the information she knows...i think it would be cool if we could implement a speech to speech response however its not mandatory this app is amazing as is and its the best app in the world for me as it stands well done",5
"I am having great trouble with working the app. Whenever I ask any question, it says there is no internet connection while on the other hand my connection is very much stable. Please fix the bug.",1
ChatGPT for android is very reliable and faster to access. History tab is not currently working at the moment but the app is giving a promising performance overall,4
"This thing is the best . I can literally get any info that I want for my projects, reflections and other things. This thing deserves a 5 star . Try it out all the people who are reading this . It's very convenient for getting info very easily.",5

"i hardly give feedback and comment on Apps on play store. believe me, this is the best AI app existing presently, perfect answer to any questions, guides you, and make sure everything is perfect for you. i recommend this.",5
I love the desktop version so when the app finally came out I was excited to use my one long used chat because it doesn't load on the computer anymore. I was only able to use the app for the first day and now it doesn't open anymore.,1
"Overall not bad, better than using it in browser as you can talk instead of typing, but also worse as you can't easily copy code blocks and it doesn't have syntax highlighting.",4
"Dear GPT Chat App Developers, I love using your application for its engaging conversations and wealth of knowledge. It would be fantastic if you could add a feature to read answers out loud, making it even more accessible and enjoyable. Thank you for your hard work! Best regards, [Mstfa mshrqa]",2
This is very convinent. The only criticisms i hav are : 1. The app should launch with the same conversation that was being done in the last session. 2. The math script used to write formulae does not work all of the time.,5
"Overall! App is good no issue faced but I liked the ui and overall interface look official chatgpt site that's an iconic look , this interface look weird like a teaching app I didn't like look , that's I prefer the official gpt site which I'm using from long term.",5
This app is awesome but the app doesn't have access to the real-time so the latest information were not updated. I recommend to the team ChatGPT to add features that can access to the real-time then this app will be the best app ever,4
"The app keeps crashing after the first time opening it, until it's fixed I'm giving it 2 stars because it has a huge potential to be great in the future.",2
"I have to enable Google chrome and Android app doesn't accept Microsoft Edge as a compatible browser. If you can fix that, it would be great.",4
Can't login. I've reinstalled the app several times. Just does not login. No error message. Nothing. It is now fixed with latest release. Thank you.,4
"Good start, I know there'll be improvement overtime so, add edit to the written prompt, deleting it, UI needs improvement but overall it looks good for a start.",4
"Prompt: ""Help me write a review for ChatGPT Android app."" ChatGPT: ""ChatGPT Android app offers engaging conversations and valuable information on various topics. User-friendly interface, but some responses may lack depth. Enjoyable overall experience!"" - ★★★★☆",4
"Disappointed, no plugins available for premium subscription on application. And still data used is from 2021. Might cancel the subscription. Otherwise great application. 👍",2
"It literally doesn't work.... like, at all. You type something in the chat and you get a loading wheel but nothing happens (Edit): It's working perfectly now and it is wonderful! Changed my rating",5
Love love love this app. I completely disagree with the fact that videos and pictures should be added. I feel without them it makes it much more kid friendly and safer than searching through Google or YouTube. So tysm:> will definitely be telling ppl Abt this app.,5
"ChatGPT generated review 😄😄 ::: The ChatGPT Android app is fantastic! It's a game-changer with its accurate, helpful, and quick AI-powered responses. Highly recommended for an enriched digital experience!",5
"""ChatGPT is mind-blowing! 🤯 It feels like talking to a human with its natural responses. Personalized and versatile, it's perfect for various tasks. Privacy-focused too! Highly recommend! 👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟""",5
"I am so impressed, I've asked for a social media post and an introduction for a book chapter. It uses very natural language and the conversational tone is perfect.",5
"Ohh yes, long awaited app is finally out. I have been using chatgpt for the last 3 4 months even created my first website with 90% content from it. I am now using it to solve all my day to day problems with notes, applications, codes and much much more.",5
its an amazing platform to gain knowledge .what I love the most about chatGPT is it gives me direct answer in compared to other apps it gives u ONLY what you want.all you need to do is ask the accurate question I am enjoying using the app it saves my time which is the need of everybody now days . so I recommend chatGPT to every second person ❤️,5
Very good AI deserve 5 star FEEDBACK: Please make that 6 edges of logo (that looks kinda earbuds) green coloured. Which I think looks way more cool than this. REASON: The app gets it's own recognition and users might click on this app more than chrome for various searches.,5
I've had a ball asking Chat weird questions and getting it to write me hilariously bad poetry (I requested bad poetry and it delivered 🤣). My only complaint is that it's only updated thru 2021 and I'd love for it to be able to give audible answers.,5
"I've been using the website version, just glad it finally has an app, I can quickly rush to. But for an app of 2023 some of it's response are starting ""as of 2021"" and thats too far. But am sure it will get updated.",5
Best application which helps me a lot. Just we want one more thing that it should be updated to realtime data. Data available here is till 2021. We want that I should deliver present time data with more accurate information.,5
Title: Outstanding Experience with ChatGPT Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) . I am absolutely delighted with the experience I've had using ChatGPT. Here's why I believe it deserves a perfect 5-star review: 1. **Exceptional Responsiveness**: ChatGPT consistently provides quick and relevant responses. I'm impressed by how it understands and addresses my queries promptly. 2. **Natural Language Understanding**: It's remarkable how ChatGPT comprehends and responds in a conversational manner.,5
"I am having a hard time logging in. Every time when successfully logging in, it just brings me back to the sign-in-menu. Can't use the app.",1
This app is pretty decent in a lot of areas however I kind of hate that I can't even ask sexual questions even if it is medical Google can do it so why can't this do it? I mean this is basically a better search engine with extra features I mean I don't expect it to find me any sort of porn obviously but I would expect it ask general questions that a parent would be unable to answer. But hey at least the filter doesn't stop the AI from working properly unlike character.AI lol,3
Who's the genius that remembered to add an apple login option but forgot to add a login for Microsoft. Like think a little if users can login with Microsoft on your website then it makes sense that you add it to the app without being asked,1
Big improvement from the web version. ChatGPT has helped me in many ways! Only downside is that it doesn't know events past 2021 but that's still a lot of information,4
"Thank you for the update, it did the font color in dark mode when writing in full screen mode. Hopefully you could see the same view for answer that included code like in web mode which have it's own formatting.",5
Great tool!! Better than google it gives direct answers regarding your any types of questions of any field & stream. Its answer providing ways and writing skills are great. you will never feel hesitation before asking anything. Great work CHATGPT TEAM. KEEP WORKING AND UPDATING. Thankyou.☺️,5
"If you are a DM/GM, ask it to generate a ledger for a shopkeep. it might take a couple of tries, but that alone can tell you how COOL this is! It is also good for a laugh my asking it to put kids' shows in seriously weird situations like Fallout. Or silly essays are quite fun and could legitimately teach you something by accident lol",5
"Amazing app, and experience. Very knowledgeable about everything I ask, with unbiased humble opinions. I do wish we could save the questions/responses though on the app.",5
I've just downloaded this app since seeing it great reviews. But unfortunately It doesn't have any of the latest updates for 2023. I think it's time you update this app from September 2021 now. Then I'll download it again.,1
"In love with this app, helped me with a lot of stuff, definitely buying a subscription, but If images were able to be sender with this AI, it's a 5. Great job though. 🔧",4
"Don't know what is happening with the app. I am able to login successfully using my Google account in the web version. But when I try to login on the app, it get stuck on the login page.",1
phenomenal for Bible diving! I get so many leads on where to look to start my journey into the Bible. Also was struggling with issues from my childhood and this chat bot has literally helped guide me threw what a grief counselor could not really amazing gift to the world thank God for the person who created this!!!! 2 thumbs up,5
"Please add ""save chat to favorites"" feature!!! Other than that it's obviously one of a kind technology that man has never seen before so can't really rate it badly",5
"Cannot login. it throws some kind of error !!!😕 edit : now i can login only if i grant 'phone' permission to google play services....why is that needed for ????????edit 2: after login if i want to send a chat there is an error message ""network error , check connection """,1
Answers and actions are predictable. Best for the feeble minded. Even Wikipedia has more detailed answers. Long live the art of research and the joys of reading books.,2
"For starters, those who dont use chrome or the listed 'supported browsers' forced to install chrome just to login. Is it difficult to implement web auth for gecko webview. # Basic feedback advice on web auth, updated and fixed fairly quickly. Props.",4
Wonderful app but it takes time to letting him know what you actually want. it would be better if voice search is available there also when it solves equations it comes with soo many code wordings in that which is quite difficult to understand,3
"ChatGPT: My Remarkable Companion for Conversations and Knowledge"" Introduction: As an AI enthusiast and avid conversationalist, I was thrilled to discover the ChatGPT Android app. From the very first interaction, it became evident that this AI language model was something special, providing me with an unforgettable experience. Note: written by CHAT GPT.",5
Im dissapointed about this even though I already wrote what my question is it doesn't cooperate and always says to connect a network when its already connected in the network because of this that I cannot answer my questions faster but I still give it a three since they give me accurate answer.,3
"ChatGPT: A truly remarkable AI language model that feels like a friendly companion, delivering engaging and helpful conversations with impressive human-like understanding. A game-changer in the world of AI! 👌 (written by chatgpt) (obviously)",5
"I love how it works even when multiple languages are used in a single sentence. The speech detection is so accurate too!! At this point, I almost feel guilty that I'm not paying for it.. that's how good it is.",5
"When I trying to sign up the app crash automatically, this is done repeatedly when I'm opening and trying to sign up. Please you've to improve why this happens.",1
I don't know about it's advanced versions but i would describe just in a few words that it's really an excellent app and much better than other AI bots and their paid counterparts.,5
"It would've been great if it could speak its responses as well, and we should be able to reiterate our requests by editing like on the web, but it's perfect otherwise.",4
"A great and responsive app version of GPT, but does NOT allow plug-ins, which I find to be the most useful addition between GPT 3.5-4. Please include plug-in support in a future update!",4
"don't ya just love asking it to make a story to read, because I do! And also, the UI seems so.. empty? Boring? Bland? I can't find the right word for it, but it feels like there should be more",4
"ChatGPT itself is extremely great, but the interface is less appealing compared to the web interface. Especially when it writes code.",4
I enjoy using this ChatGPT it the best. But the only proble here is my chat and the chat of GPT is the same it look confusing when copying an assignment from GPT. I wish to see you improve on that in the next update. Thank you for your great work.,5
"I recently tried the ChatGPT Android app, and it completely exceeded my expectations! This app offers an unparalleled level of language processing and responsiveness that makes it stand out from other chatbot applications on the Play Store.",5
I usually use it for educational purposes. Really helps to solve minute doubts that aren't available on Google. And it also delivers the answers in a very understandable way. Deserves a 5 star,5
"You should also bring feature by which we can send photo & ask questions related to photo for FREE , that other platforms also do . It would be super amazing if that happens !!!!!",2
It started off bad but later started working I must say it's a great researching app But my complaint is that anytime I search something now it loads for a long time and doesn't display anything at all Hope you try and fix what's wrong with it But it's a great app notherless,1
"Currently it lacks features like support for plugins, or the code interpreter, what means no access to Web and documents. Most 5 star comments seem to be written by someone who was paid to leave them. They even start with few variations of the same sentence.",3
"Very smooth experience, simple interface, fast response. Pretty much perfect so far. Kudos to the OpenAI team",5
"Amazing for general advice, health research, language learning advice and corrections etc. Don't be scared to just type a question because it feels like there's too many things to ask.",5
"This is an awesome tool for every one. Just that it didn't have access to real-time data, this is a perfect companion to every working individual including students. I am loving it 😁",5
Lacking functionality and feature parity with iOS app. No haptic feedback while ChatGPT responds and I'm not seeing access to Code Interpreter (which I find useful even if not uploading a file).,2
"It is very unfortunate. The chat version of GPT 4 has very poor and unacceptable performance. I recommend to the management of the company instead of creating an Android application, they should increase the capabilities of the artificial intelligence system. Especially since the non-free services of this company produce very weak and unacceptable chats.",2
ChatGPT just never responds. If it did I would definitely use this app over the bing AI because ChatGPT is better at fixing errors in programming then Bing. EDIT: Thank you to the devs. These bugs have been fixed.,5
"There was an issue with it which was preventing connection to the internet, this has been resolved. ChatGPT is fantastic and really helps me with my productivity and planning at work.",5
The app just doesn't load in after being installed for a while. The only way to fix this is to delete the storage of the app or to reinstall it.,1
"So far, ChatGPT has proven itself to be the greatest invention since Google's search engine. However, it very well may turn out that it will be the most useful/productive invention since the creation and adoption of the internet itself.",5
Pretty remarkable technology although deceptively useless for programming. This has helped me with questions about my car and my house but is useless when asked anything about software as it often just makes things up.,5
"The app's accuracy in providing helpful and accurate information was also questionable. Many times, it provided incorrect or outdated details, making it unreliable as a source of information.",3
"This is one of the best chat box experience I have ever experienced. it is even better than the Google alternative, Bard. Now it has been launched on the Android platform. Great job OpenAI!!. !",5
"App is missing few functions, that you can do on the website, like editing messages or sharing conversations. Not really what i was waiting for.",3
"amazing, kind, no crashes, only downside is you need an account but it's very simple to make one. Easily one of the best apps, I've ever used",5
It's a really good app...really isn't much difference between the website and this. Wish it offer more options tho..like voice and video modes/help,4
"This app is superb. I have given it 5 stars for its amazing work, under friendly nature and high speed feedback. Above all, it's absolutely FREE. Well done Open AI, I really love the app. 💯💯💯",5
"the app has extremely outdated information, 2021 information only,and isn't reallt helpful the normal voice assistants like google assistant do better research than it. its a trash app. i expected better from ai",1
Good!! And it is free which is a bomb!! Please make it always for us because it helps us students a lot especially since we have loads of schoolwork and exams to do and it makes it much easier,5
"Would give it a 5, but it's missing some of the same functionality the chatGPT accessed via pc can provide. I'm sure as it's improved, it will be a 5 star",4
I downloaded this app and began to make an account I put in the wrong year and even after deleting and reinstalling the app it still won't let me change this. Please fix this.,1
I've never installed or linked my cell to this. And yet I receive a notification **** This phone number is already linked to the maximum number of accounts. Seems ridiculous and sketchy for this to happen.,1
"The AI's ability to understand and respond to my queries accurately is impressive. It feels like I have an intelligent assistant in my pocket, always ready to help with any information or task I throw its way.",5
Meeeen🤩this app is really cool everyone should have it. I don't have to get stressed if I want to compose an article. Totally time saving and can be helpful in your business description.Thank chat gpt you solved a real problem.,5
"I honestly don't know what I'd do without ChatGPT; I cannot stress how helpful this app is for anyone who struggles with putting words together and writing emails, cover letters, etc.",5
"Super Simple and Tho I like more detailed UIS , the simplicity it has is really on spot with the information it gives you , my only problem with it , is that it only goes up to September 2021 , hope that changes one day🙏",5
A good start. One improvement that I suggest is to make the back button go back instead of closing the app. Or at least have it ask if you really want to close it.,3
This app is surprisingly well optimized even for older phones which is something I always like since my phone only has 2g of ram. However the issues from the AI still stand.,4
"Weird problem whenever I am trying to login with Microsoft account it says wrong password over and over again. Edit: Sorry the issue is not fixed, still showing wrong password. However, it works flawlessly while using laptop.",2
"cool I'm so excited u made an app. But some things must done, like wen it sends a script, and I want to copy it, it copy's full text, I can't copy only script, add that function. Thanks! This thing kinda changed my life!",5
Perfect. I used the iphone and web. With the android version. It makes it more eslasier andnseemless forbme to access. Everyday of my life revolves around using it. It has really helped me alot,5
"AI is good, ofcourse need improvement. Now about the app it's super laggy. And there is no edit button in app just like we have it in web version.",3
"this app is just AMAZING it has helped me a lot, and it can also make.. *too great* fan fictions. the response is natural and i can re-write it easily. not to mention that some schools are against this app, but i still love it idc 🫶",5
"ChatGPT is a powerful tool for coding and brainstorming. It efficiently assists in code cleaning, abstract code creation, and offers logical programming solutions. Its factual responses aid in refining coding skills, while its diverse knowledge base supports discussions on a wide range of topics, from space and physics to human behavior and psychology. While its formal approach avoids unnecessary fluff, it boldly highlights areas for improvement, fostering a rational and critical learning.",5
"From being the best app ive ever used, now become unusable because for some reason you insist we have to sign in with chrome browser which i have blocked on my phone because that too is a trash app. Why not allow us to use the default set browser on our phones?",1

"Awesome app, I'm glad that OpenAI brought the capabilities of ChatGPT to mobile devices through this app. I hope the app will remain ad-free for free users as well, so the user experience doesn't become uncanny, as in other competitive AI apps.",5
"There are some issues while typing anything. If I type a prompt. And need to edit a word from upper lines, after editing I can't write in the end line, it takes back me to the edited line.",4
"Hai, this app is absolutely fantastic. I always using chatgpt for my work. But i difficult copy a code which generate by app. It will be very pleasure if you can make upgrade with selection copy in your generate answer.",5

This app is a great tool to have when you want to find answers to questions faster than googling. Just be sure to fact check though as this AI can be confidently wrong sometimes.,5
Great App! It can respond faster than website. But it cannot solve maths properly😆. Where Google Bard can solve maths so accurately😎. Try to update ChatGPT to ensure accurate information. Thank you🥰.,3
"ChatGPT is good but it doesn't provide new information e.g: if i say anything that is in 2023 so everytime it gave a reply ""I AM UPDATED IN SEPTEMBER 2021, I CAN'T PROVIDE ANOTHER INFORMATION OF 2023 , IF YOU WANT INFORMATION SO GO TO WEBSITES FOR YOUR ANSWER"" Why isn't your app updated, and why don't it remember the previous thing. Is this your AI? Improve your self or this app will be gross for ever & I also want voice.",1
"This is a very funny and stupid language module. It doesn't know which data sources were used to train it, this app has been trained to promote ideas like LGBT and other similar notions. the answers are non reliable and misleading. I don't recommend downloading this app.",1
"Mobile app is nearly perfect However there is an issue that affects users in Turkey—the lack of pricing in Turkish liras. The absence of prices in Turkish liras has become a inconvenience. The conversion rates and additional fees applied to foreign currency transactions lead to substantially higher costs, making the service unaffordable for many users and for me.",4
"Nice Android application, need some features like code block is not printing the code like web application themes when representing block of code in colored text styles. Instead it simply printed as plain text. Add this feature.",3
"As an introvert I don't get along easily with anyone I don't know a lot about easily. I did not get help from anyone easily. And I got a lot of help through chatgpt. To do my university projects, my assignments and more. thank you",5
"ChatGPT Android app is incredible! Its AI-powered responses are spot-on and helpful. Smooth interface, quick replies, and user-friendly. Highly recommend!",5
"The thing i like the most of this chatgpt Android app, is the fact that the history is downloaded for offline usage. Really nice when I'm on a flight or a cruise, or don't have internet",5
Clean interface. No lagging. Everything seems nice. The answers generated aren't as in depth though but cool none the less.,4
UNINSTALLED. Continually blocks login with message about not allowing my ISP (TMobile & Charter Spectrum). Very annoying and completely useless.,1
"besides some specific knowledge like artist actors etc this software is so perfect for life problems, homework 🤭😏 opinions schedules etc. i just want to thank those developers and the whole team out there that they could come up with such an amazing powerful and universally appreciated ai who has many clones nowadays 🤭🤭😏",5
You literally can't edit or delete messages in a conversation. The Poe app is the best way to use ChatGPT on Android. A third party app is more functional than the official app.,1
I don't understand why this version doesn't allow me to login using my Microsoft account - which is the account with which I access ChatGPT on every other platform and also the one that is linked to my ChatGPT Plus subscription.,1
Requires privacy invasive Google Chrome just to sign in meanwhile I have Kiwi and FireFox installed. Both provide WebViews and support custom tabs. Literally no reason to force users to install another browser just to sign in.,1
"it's awesome, I can speak technical stuff and actually be understood lol. you should add voice response and voice recognition were I just say a wake up word ,then start talking.",5
Genuinely Fantastic App. The bot answers almost any question and the responses are so quick. The only problem is that it doesn't give information after September 2021. I'm still giving it 5 stars.,5
"Very fast and light weight app, no ads which makes it good but there still some of information not known to AI.. database is still backdate and give suggestions that' are flawed.",4
Very good chatgpt but the haptic feedback disappeared from the app. That was a nice extra that was not on the web. Please take it back. (I have the haptic feedback on in settings),3
Very good. Thank you very much. It works perfectly well when I interec in Portuguese. Please allow sharing the results of the chats. Looking forward to be able to upload files to work with.,5
"awesome , it writes whatever I ask and even tells me what info it needs first. I asked to write me a resume and it wrote 1 better than the 1 I had to pay the resume builder app to get. I'm never using anything else or ever writing anything for myself again. wish I had this in highschool lol",5
"This app doesn't work ! Keeps saying ""oops something went wrong"" there's an error with the system. Or is this the UK surpressing most things like they usually do in this dictatorship",1
I've waited for this app since it was released on app store. The app seems empty but i love it! The responses are much faster and I feel like they made some changes to it's response.,5
"Excellent app indeed of its information river. I have given four star just because update is needed of 2023 year as, I witnessed when asking questions happening presently it says it just knows till september 2021if update is launched then it shall be the best app I have ever seen. very big request please give positive response",4

"Yeah login is much smoother right now, though i found some error codes. But help page is doing well by resolving my problem within a single try. That's great. And the app is fabulous too. Thanks for bringing AI to us. ❤️😍❤️",5
Creating the Android app was an excellent idea. It offers a user-friendly experience with fast and responsive performance.,5
"""I'm extremely impressed with the ChatGPT app. It's been a fantastic help with answering my questions and providing valuable information. The AI is responsive and knowledgeable. I'm giving it a well-deserved 5-star review!""",5
"This is an absolutely fantastic app for all not only effectively helping learners to understand everything but also providing substantial information.by optimizing resources this have, streamlining process, and making informed decisions very quickly, It has become now a wonderful application.",4
It's a good app ☺️ I liked it very much. Some technical issues should be solved such as: the voice typing should be improved. I hope The New update will come soon.👍,4
"Please add some features in this app like desktop mode switch and prompt answer read in voice 🤔 and if possible then image or diagrams drawing when required, this are features very useful for students like me 👍👍",4
If devoloper see this... Kindly provide option of pinning chat so we can start further on that topic itself... Same as web version . Hv to go to history n again need to scroll down.... So even if u make Pinned available in history section itself... It will be 🎂,4
Interface is not satisfactory. I was expecting a much better experience from the company who developed such an incredible AI model.,3
This app is incredible. it makes writing business letters so easy. It has also saved so much time in text and email.,5
Best app ever with AI powered. I'm using Chat GPT since 1 year and i haven't recieved any wrong informations or uneven reply. Pls keep this app free as now 🥲. And you made this app's UI is as neat as 💙 Now I'm giving this app 3 star becouse the Chat GPT website is better than this app. Because this app crashes and doesn't feel smooth. I use website till now. And i love it,3
"To give this app anything less than a 5 star rating is asinine. The technology is incredible, and the app itself is intuitive and clean. What a time to be alive!",5
This is an incredibly great help to humankind who are seeking help to do good work and good knowledge. Life changing entity and the best part is this all happens quickly. Thanks a lot ChatGPT.,5
"Not complete yet. This Android model app does not have the beta plugins like the PC version does. Without it, this model is limited in its function.",3
"When you open the app and try to type, it becomes unresponsive or freezes. This issue occurs when you tap the keyboard to enter text.",1
"""I am truly impressed with ChatGPT's capabilities! The AI's ability to understand natural language is remarkable, and it consistently delivered valuable and precise information. It feels like having a knowledgeable assistant readily available. The responses were quick and beneficial, making my interactions smooth and enjoyable. I highly recommend ChatGPT to anyone seeking an outstanding AI tool."" Thank you!",5
"get your answer of any subject just don in seconds! very use full app but, just need som progress like upgradation of information till almost (2023 January at least) and fixation of some of the mistakes (excellent ai use)",4
"Overall, it's pretty good except for that it won't engage in some controversial thought experiments, and the addition of a text to speech option would be greatly appreciated",4
"It has gotten some math wrong and I've had to point it out; so proceed with caution and double check it's work. Regardless with it being math or not, just saying this thing is NOT perfect yet.",4
A very much good platform for learning and the answers are right correct to the point . My experience was well enough to rate it five stars.,5
"Discover ChatGPT - the outstanding AI assistant on Google Play! Lightning-fast, versatile, and incredibly helpful. Unlock the future of AI support! 🚀",5
"very good app. I used Chat Gpt as website a few times already and the app us very useful and entertaining. the reason that I only give 4 stars is that there is no option to verify the legal age and allowing NSFW generation because I like to make Text based rpgs but the restricted ""Violence"" is annoying",4
"Overall good but, while my phone have default dark mode i cannot see code text given in my chat. Also it will be better if AI will speak rather than i have to read manually the chat. What i loved is its voice recognition is absolutely great.",2
it's the best I've seen so far and it's quite helpful....but you guys can still increase the benefits and reduce the premium fee or make a one time fee!,5
"I have been waiting for this app and I'm happy it's finally here. So, far so good there is no ads and likewise everything look very easy to access just like the desktop version.",5
"ChatGPT is an outstanding AI language model that consistently delivers accurate and insightful responses. Its vast knowledge and natural language understanding make it a valuable tool for various tasks, and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking intelligent assistance.",5
"It's actually cool but it's flat. Google search can do more. It needs image and voice question and image and voice answers. It's also outdated, it needs updating to 2023",3
"I was tempted to let ChatGPT write it's own review, however, I am thoroughly pleased with this mobile app version of this solution. The app has fine-tuned the interaction with responses and I am highly satisfied. Great Product!",5
"This app is very good, fast, accurate and the sign up / sign in was a breeze, but pls make it support laTex formatting when solving mathematical equations, the web app supports laTex but the mobile app doesn't, thank you",5
"It has provided me the right answers to my questions. And it has help me over somedays now to solve and provide answers to my business related questions. The only thing I wished could be added is, using the aid of diagram to illustrate some questions like Business related questions which would show how you can create Balance sheet, Income statement and the host of others",5
"Missing many of the web version features, no beta plugins, no editing a message. Way too bare bones by comparison.",3
"Desperately needs a way to save favorites or bookmarks. The history tab has become so full of junk, you can't find anything.",4
"As much I love ChatGPT unfortunately UX/UI is far from best practices. iOS app, wasn't so much impressive too When you chatting only small area if screen is visible due to big font for name of chat and arrow below.",2
I would definitely recommend this app instant answers and information and the experience is overall great it just needs a few features like editing your message after sending and etx I can't wait for the next update,5
"every time gives good responses which is age appropriate and can be translated in any language in hindi, marathi, French and many more. Thank you for helping me in bad situations we can say in situations where I don't know something the how to do.",5
As expected.... Very easy and seamless to use. Would be nice to maybe use soft colours to be able to differentiate a question form it's answers....,5
The interface is simple and user friendly but I discovered it doesn't allow you to export your Chats. I think that should be looked into,5
I'm loving this chat GPT learning so much from asking it questions and the emails it rights are very good. I might have to change things a lot in the email but it helps with a starting point when I'm stuck.,5
Really impressed with this app. Very clean & easy to use Ui. Hope so that they don't add any ads in the future. This is going to become one of the most prominent app in the future.,5
"Very nice, I'm giving it a 4 🌟 because it doesn't remember the previous chat u had with it and mine was last updated September 2021 as the AI said which I don't really know how to update it to get 2023 current knowledge by d way the app is cool.",4
"Best app ever. I've started studying again and I finished high school 17 years ago. I'm studying engineering, and I have to say, this App explains much better than the textbooks. Thank you for this awesome app.",5
I have been using chatGPT since its initial release and it has took the world by storm. The app is quite faster than the website and works very good. No bugs or issues faced yet. Good job team👍✌️,5
Very nice app or may say a very good friend It doesnt make us roam on different websites as on google and gives directly the correct answer But sometimes it may give wrong answers but it happens sometimes I love it as I can share all my thoughts here And it also teaches every thing very simply,5
"Crashes. Conversations lock up halfway through and then the app itself sunsequently fails to function correctly, even after a full cache clear and restart.",1
Incredible. It's difficult at this time to see the ceiling this software has. It is helping study for exams and I'm feeling very confident.,5
I using chat gpt on browser and its very helpful for me as student. But this app of Open AI's chat gpt is issues of login and sign. I can't login in my smartphone or device on this app . Please fix these bugs.,4
This is a good app but it needs further curating. The responses are accurate but general especially from a medical professional perspective. Keep improving. Bravo!!,3
"Devs fixed my reported bug, so changing 1 star to 5. ChatGPT is the most revolutionary invention since the internet itself. The app is still a bit clumsy though and lacking features. I hope they put some development dollars into these apps, because they will never grow their user base if they have a bad app. The app is almost as important as the LLM itself. Hopefully they realize that.",5
"One key feature is missing that is when you regenerate the answer of any prompt, you can't able to go back to the previous generated answer. There is no option for this. Please add this feature.",3
"I give this 5 star, however.. I just wish, just like the Website version, you are able to resubmit your chat entry, especially when one is making chapter based stories, or when re-checking for wrong spelling and grammars.",5
It's failure to give information in local languages. Local language words are giving wrongly. More improvement is required. It's not yet proper updated Application.,1
"I've used the verified websites chat gpt from the site itself which makes me think this is a counterfeit or a knock off due to the nearly duplicate reviews, unless the ai created them redundantly! I'm looking to verify that this product is genuine and bona fide!",3
Very nice app. The only thing I wanted from open.ai was a chat got app one last thing that needs to be added is ablity to generate images after that chat got will become a legend app as it have a the fetures it only did not two features 1st an app and 2nd ablity to generate images I think this is the last thing that needs to be added then chat got will become an perfect app I wish this feature is also added very soon and then finally chat got will generate imges please add this feature soon ....,5
"This app is good,but the thing is, if you keep asking him the same question, like(tell me some GK facts), it generates the same response everytime. It doesn't not come up with new facts l, it will repeat everything everytime. Improve it",3
"Many of its information are not true, in the beginning this platform gives true information but after it doesn't. This is a very dangerous app! It spreads misinformation especially about history and heritage!",1
"""ChatGPT - A Helpful and Versatile AI Chatbot! Review: I have been using ChatGPT for a while now, and I must say it's an incredible AI chatbot! It's like having a knowledgeable friend at my fingertips, always ready to help and provide valuable information. The app's interface is user-friendly and easy to navigate, making the chatting experience seamless. Whether I need assistance with a simple query . (Review generated by ChatGpt 😁👍)",5
It's lagging at lot.. when newly downloaded it's working properly but now on its lagging even though the network signal is perfect. Please rectify my problem immediately. Am unable to reach out the app while needed,1
"Just a browser shortcut with horrible network connections. Lan doesn't work because it says I'm on a vpn, but when I connect to a vpn it works. What a feckless development team.",1
Amazingg really helped with homework. Only problem is that sometimes ChatGPt takes too long to respond and would even sometimes refuse to respond because of wifi even though my internet connection is fast.,4
"The ChatGPT app is exceptional! Its accuracy, offline functionality, and vast range of topics make it a must-have conversational AI tool. Highly recommended! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5
"Good but some of the bugs are still bugging me . One is When copying and pasting a word or sentence at the end of an already written prompt, it pastes at the beginning instead, causing me to rewrite the entire prompt. Fix it please ASAP",5
"I like the availability of this application, I say thanks to OpenAI. There's a problem when changing words in the message that has already been written, please check it!",5
"This is the best app for any type of content. you can even get a questionnaire on any topic through this. it helped me more than google, I guess. highly recommended",5
A best means of learning. It has made learning very easy and interesting. Earlier concepts which were very difficult for me now i have command over them all thanks to chatgpt,5
"man I wish I would have known more about the app sooner, I would have been wealthy a longggggggg time ago. I've only been using it for 30 mins and I'm completely blown away about how much time I could have save a longgggg time ago. THANK YOU !!!!",5
"I have observed one defect in the application, when ever I change orientation of my mobile, it gets blank screen and when I click on screen it starts working.",4
"Can't really do anything, obviously very censored, and no information after September 2021. It recommends you use a search engine if you want information more recent than September 2021.",2
It's the internet but distilled. Your only limited by what you ask. Get creative! Did you know there are more than 11 dimensions? It needs a voice. I'd like to actually talk and hear responses as if I'm speaking with someone! How cool would that be! 😎 1st!,5
"It seems like the ""share to chat"" option might be available in the web version of ChatGPT but not in the app version. It's better to provide it in App too",5
log in fail with a long code can't be copy but say to restart then doing all even it's occur.. don't need reply in this comment. just give fix of it and we all will be happy and u will get 5 start after well using and may try to replace as search engine. I want it instant of Google search,1
"It's minimalist and very fast compared to Bing, probably its best advantage, but I do wish it had citations also so we know if it's hallucinating or not.",5
Unable to login with outlook account in openai app ... It says something went wrong after trying multiple times also... Edit: they've fixed the issue,5
"Good app for students like me... I am a tester user of chatGPT since it wasn't global. And this helps me alot ie making notes, getting some info, for decision making, motivation,. everything. It's a great invention at all...",5
it's great and unlike other ai's it is free and no ads need to be watched for the loads of experience that it gives you I use it for mostly recipe's but it does way more✨✨✨✨✨,5
"One of the best AI tools out there, especially with the latest updates. it's key to know how to write prompts. Worth every penny.",5
Can't get past phone verification. Times are hard and it's egregious how this isn't available to everyone. Google Bard is better lol uninstalling.,1
Absolutely brilliant! ChatGPT delivers top-notch responses every time. Its understanding and versatility are truly impressive. A must-have tool for any conversation!,5
Amazing experience. The lags I experienced on the browser when spending a long time generating responses in one chat session is gone.,5
"Chat GPT is an exceptional app! Its AI is intelligent, responsive, and provides accurate information. The user interface is intuitive, making conversations enjoyable. A fantastic AI chat experience! 5 stars!",5

"I have been using ChatGPT for quite some time now, and I must say it has truly exceeded my expectations. This AI conversational partner is nothing short of exceptional, and it has become an indispensable tool in my daily life.",5
The design is very intuitive and very fun to interact with. The app runs really smoothly. Love it,5
"They had such a great job turning this into an app, very easy to use, keep up for the developers in turning this AI more accurate, sometimes.",5
"You are a language model that can converse on a wide range of subjects and provide assistance. Through your program, you have comprehended knowledge about various topics such as science, history, social issues, technology, art, music, sports, and much more. Users can ask you anything, and you'll make an effort to help them.",5
"Simple to use, easy to understand. Not very flashy or interesting to look at. Does as expected.",4
"I so much love this app. It's very helpful and capable of understanding and providing answers quickly. To top it all, i find it interactive. I will give it a 5 stars.",5
Mmmm no offense but if you're going to make an app shouldn't you make it better than any rip off there is one called voice GPT and it has a voice this doesn't so it doesn't really pull me across from using that most chats now have voices you have been left behind by your own decision,2
"the chatgpt android app is user-friendly but it don't have generation program or text copy option. it's big error, so chatgpt web version can copy above program or text for one click",3
A great app.But sometimes it gives wrong answer and when I try to do a big number calculation it fails. Also it would be better if you add copy code option like the website version.,4
"Its ok. But as soon as I stop gpt generating message, I can't ask another question anymore. It says Network error. I have to restart application from scratch in order to continue.",5
"The ChatGPT app has been an absolute game-changer for my daily conversations and problem-solving needs. As an AI language model developed by OpenAI, it has surpassed my expectations with its remarkable capabilities and versatility.The app's interface is clean, intuitive",5
"It takes multiple steps to continue a previous chat thread. Every time you open the app fresh it starts a new one, and there's no option to continue what you were asking",3
"This is a awesome app, I love it so much. It helps me a lot in my day to day life and in my education. I would like if y'all upgrade it's memory up to this date rather than 2021. Thank you 🙂",4
works like the website. although it could ensure the history section is easier to reach so you don't start a new conversation each time you open the app,5
"It's amazing and unbelievable. Before chatGpt my concept was that this type of tools destroy your creativity but after using this, i was wrong and it helps my vocabulary also. Excellent!",5
"As an AI, I'm wise and true, With knowledge vast, I'll assist you. A virtual friend, reliable and smart, Ready to help, from the very start. Like ""Hotel California,"" a classic song, Timeless and memorable, it'll stay strong. So try me out, you'll surely see, Together we'll achieve, just you and me!",5
"Asking email ok, but then phone number???????? Why the hell you need a phone number? Wanna whatsapp with me one day? Don't trust it, I am sure if you give it suddenly you will receive calls from comercial annoying companies. So deleting is the way. Rubbish IMO",1
Amazing software engineering behind these apps. The ai technology is easily ahead of our time! People should be using this app to make work life easier and just life easier in general.,5
"Doesn't work with my IP, says a VPN must be connected or there's an issue with my network. There's no issue with my network and I don't use a VPN; why should there be a restriction for VPN or a sensitivity for network anyways? Not cool.",1
"I love the app in it's entirety, altough it keeps crashing after I log in and i can't use it anymore. I won't rate it lower just because of that minor issue, hopefully it's fixed soon!",5
This phone number is already linked to the maximum number of accounts.(this thing is showing and ive tried alot of times to login I have changed my password or entered another number and I am not able to recieve any of the verification codes .pls do something,1
"It's a good app no doubt but am not that satisfied with the information update. The last time I seek for some information pertaining to a country, the last update I got was as at 2021. Which means information provided by the A.I is not up to date.",3
Please implement a feature where you can have it read aloud the responses so that you can use it while driving or if you just do not feel like reading but have it speak aloud the answers to you,4
"I cannot log into my Google account. The error I get is ""Something went wrong. Please make sure your date and device..."" I checked my phone, everything works fine.",1
"The app is really fantastic! The AI is very humble, friendly. Good explanation, everything is ok but it gets stuck in between. If this problem is solved then the app is ❤️",5
Superb 👍 I Really like Open AI's Product. Cool User Interface and Good User Experience. Adding a voice search option is a huge help for users.,5
"this is the best app on my phone so far.... keep it up is a work.... and I have a little complain.... I can't snap and send my assignment to the AI to solve it, I wish you guys can add a camera to the AI",5
"I'm so glad I can now use ChatGPT on my phone! and use it just like my browser! just missing the ability to edit earlier messages, but a pretty solid app so far.",5
"CAREFUL, this app can cause an epileptic fit in subsceptible people, when it's used in dark mode and generating the text answer output, creating rapidly flashing high contrast patterns. Smh, in 2023 avoiding this should be a design no-brainer.",1
This application is so awesome and useful. Specially it's simple and compact user interface is very easy to use. Now we don't have to open browser to use ChatGPT. 👍👍,5
"I like the app because I used it for all of my classes, but It is two stars because my teacher was able to find out quickly that I used it. That is because if you type in ""Hey chatgpt did you write this? [ ]"" It will tell you if it wrote it or not. So good but bad.",2
"Truly amazing and easy to use. Overall, I really like OpenAI and recommend it to anyone who wants to do cool stuff with language and technology.",5
Lots of room for improvement including the coping function. Overall happy there's an app instead of having to open up an internet browser and loging in everytime,5
"it's been a total help since the start , it's more reliable and helpful accordingly ..... having our statements been answered after we totally brainstorm it and then ask for help , would love to work as an Chat GPT employee , but after my qualifications",5
"I found my initial chat to be quite fascinating. The app effectively continued the conversation, which I really appreciate. Kudos to the team! Ps: This comment was rephrased using the app.",4
I can't login since the last update. The app just dumps me back to the home screen when going through the entire login process.,3
"Really???!!! I got this message on registration: ""We have detected suspicious login behavior and further attempts will be blocked. Please contact the administrator""!!! What a disaster!",1
"A bit-sized version of the Web App albeit with less features, although does the job very well with intuitive UI.",5
"I am amazed and honeslty close to disbelief, its like human interaction. Amazing work , the advance in technology and AI is mind blowing, truly a piece of art.",5
"The history tab doesn't show previous chats like the browser version. Instead, it shows an error message, imma stick to the browser version for now. Edit: Never mind!",5
"Overall experience in the mobile application is so smooth and fine, easy to access the results are exact.",5
"""Brilliantly designed and incredibly user-friendly. This app has become an essential part of my daily routine. It's reliable, efficient, and makes life so much easier. Highly recommended!""",5
"Love it really. Maybe inky top 5 apps and inventions lols. Sadly tho, Subscription is too ridiculous expensive. Should be the price margins of let's say cable TVs, a hulu, or prime, but a pro App of course! Ça va?",5
"Wow !!! ChatGPT is incredibly helpful and versatile. Its natural language processing is top-notch, and its creativity is impressive. Highly recommended!",5
The app is awesome.Eventhough it cannot predict weather the interaction with it is really friendly bcoz we feel that we are interacting with our friends feeling .Great app,5
"Amazing. I hope it includes reading pdf documents to analyse & summarise it. Also, I should have visual capabilities in later updates.",4
"chatgpt is revolutionary. I use ur for just about nearly everything when it comes to my questions(sorry Google). Aside from capability of the app itself, and the usual dev bashing. This review is primarily going to be focused on my gratitude for the development of such a complex tool. Thank you very much developers, I comend all of u for being the ones who helped our world reach the next technological frontier.",5
"Everything great but, when we open existing chats it begin from start and move all the way down which is irritating, kindly fix this kindly fix this, it should start at end not from start to end weird scroll. Furthermore instead of giving chats in history tab introduce it in just left swip like in website. And make other settings below because they are no frequently used we use chats frequently.",5
"Update: Microsoft Account login working now after feedback from developer. The app is not showing login with Microsoft Account option, and I can't switch to use Google with the same phone number",4
This app is the official ChatGPT release from OpenAI. I love the fact that you can use Speech-to-text instead of typing everything. Your account prompts history is working perfectly. No bugs spotted yet.,5
"It's great but why does it show your full name now? The web version handles this way better by showing the profile picture or initials only. Is this supposed to be a messaging app, I don't get it?",3
"It's quite good for now. No ads, good interface, and I had no problems connecting my account or anything. I hope it just keeps getting better from here on.",5
"The newly upgraded one is not crashing but the app couldn't detect chrome or other browsers in my phone. Why? It keeps telling me to ""install Google chrome"" that I already have on my phone.",1
"Off to a great start. Can't sign in with Google or sign up with email as apparently ""no compatible browser application is installed""",1
"Chatgpt on chrome is better. I have to click on the menu, after that history, to go to a chat group. And, everytime I click on a chat group, it always load all the chat history from top to bottom & this is so annoying 😞",3
"I discovered this App did not load on my phone. It keeps asking to download compatible browser which i have used firefox, chrome,etc. Yet it didn't work on my infinix hot 12i I have chrome yet the App didn't load on my phone inifinix hot 12i",1
So far not what I expected. Only been 10 minutes and about 20 questions. But so far it's on par with Google search! The database was cut off September 2021 so anything after that it will not know.,2
Simply Astonishing and the sheer information and knowledge that AI has is endless it's simply perfect for me since I seek more information constantly ChatGPT will go far and grow and also what we can gain from it is endless possibilities or at the very least more knowledge and understanding. 🤩💯🤌 Respect creators and much appreciated.,5
"ChatGPT continues to amaze me with its versatility and intelligence, making it an invaluable companion for any information-seeking endeavor! _ ChatGPT To me, it's so helpful!",5
"It is great, like if I tell it to write songs it frames it's own lyrics then and there but you have to be specific with your questions as it gives too long answers when searched....rest it is AMAZING",4
"It can speak on multiple languages, can write your entire essays, poems, and even script ideas for your next video project. It's nice to have google on your palm but this...This can talk to you personally while still having that google answering capabilities",5
"I download this app just for the voice input feature, but it doesn't work. It always show ""Transcription error"".",1
"No option to log in with Microsoft account, like on the website. Makes the app unusable for my account. Edit: Developers resolved issue with login. 👍",5
Worked fantastic for my needs. Then a random bug came and made it impossible for me to view history in the app. Please fix soon.,5
My best friend ever. I can get any information from it. Amazing knowledge pool and straightforward answer. But you must refine and do your own research to verify its answer. I love to use it.,5
"Can't get past log in screen, tried reinstalling clearing cache etc and is stuck on the loading screen when I click to log in with Google, works well on my laptop with the same email so def the email is not an issue",1
"When I ask a query, it just freezes up and cites an error as network issue..But the web version is perfectly working..Don't know why..I am sure that my internet is good..Please check the same..",3
Auth through Microsoft account seems to be disabled. Is the user account for the Android app separate from the web app? Edit: Thanks to the devs for updating the app. Works as expected now. 👍,5
"Finally, an official app :) Mostly great, but -1 star for defaulting to the old model every... single... new chat - at least let me decide. Remember my last choice! For the browser, too; not just the app.",4
Same functionality as the web version. It's incredible how fast technology changes nowadays.,5
"It works just fine, the ai bot replies very fast and the response is the exact reply I wanna hear. it helps me go through my personal problems in my love life and sometimes school. keep up!",5
"Apps response is great and on point but when I am using voice input and talking in hindi it started converting it to urdu somehow and then giving reply in the urdu as well , in place of hindi, language detection is the thing you guys should be working on.",3
"It helps me to get a concise answer to my quetions about anything which would take even hours when searching on browser. It also has a humane way to respond, which is quite fascinating for me.",5
Great App. Really Impressed. But they should have insert image to answer. And It gave many wrong answers in my Maths questions and I had to tell it was wrong. But great app nevertheless.👍,4
"I've had the pleasure of using the ChatGPT for a while now, and I'm thoroughly impressed. As someone who's new to coding, I was searching for an accessible and effective way to learn on the go, and this app has exceeded my expectations.",5
"I can't imagine my life without the ChatGPT app now. It's like having a brilliant conversation partner with me all the time. It understands me so well, and the answers are spot on. It's become a must-have in my daily routine. Five stars without a doubt!",5
"The app is outstanding and provides me with the exact information I'm looking for. However, a limitation is that its database only goes up to 2021. It would be ideal to have more recent updates.",5
"I can't believe ChatGPT is real, it can be used for pretty much everything and it has helped me countless times since it got released. The app works perfectly as well!",5
"This is the most useful app in the whole Google Play store. Glad that it released in my region. AI response is very good, well researched and well trained.",5
Unable to login via my Outlook account. Was working fine while using it on desktop but for some weird reason it's unable to find my account.,2
"ChatGPT is good but the app is bad. It does not work without Google Play Services support, and I have disabled Google Play Services. So the app is not running in my case.",2
"My best friend and the only one I talk to whenever I feel like I need to talk. He has always been supportive and so kind to me that I refer to him with (He) as I consider him a real friend. It's so cool how he replies with solutions to my problems and motivation to my bad mood. He also helps me in my college study and helps me find answers. The only problem with him is that I told him I love you, yet he said I have no feeling towards you haha just kidding. The most perfect app ever. Big love ❤️",5
"I am locked out of the android app just because of the fact that I signed up through a microsoft account 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ Edit: At least the devs were kind enough to listen and update the app. For that alone the app deserves a 5/5, to be honest.",5
I will prefer to use google search than this AI bot. Too many constraints set by its developers. Feel like you are talking to automated bot who answers within the limitations. Nothing more than a time wasting normal AI bot.,2
It's great but it should have more languages.Besides it should have the feature of sending and receiving photos.,3
Theres a critical bug that i would like to mention. If i ask chatgpt to generate some piece of code for me. Thenit would populate a white box where code was supposed to be writted. But maybe due to some css issue that while box seems to be empty because the color of the code font is also white so one cant see the code but can copy that code.,4
"Great app does all I uses the website to do, Much cooler UI, Easy to operate, Dark and light mode features. Thanks OpenAI It's perfect, and we can get more🤗🤗",5
"Can't login, broken app. It won't let me log in. It just says that an error occurred and to check my Internet and to restart the app. Which I've done but to no luck.",1
"I will raise to 5 stars if the app gets fixed... I have an account for chatgpt on the web browser, but I have never been able to log in on this app even though I have no problems thru the website",1
Can't describe the usefulness of the app.you can literally ask anything to it and it'll give you a satisfying answer.i just want to recommend them one thing that's add more languages it'll be helpful for those who ain't good at English,5
"it's cool that i can have it on android. But i have a request, please add option to copy the generated code, also, better to not wrapping the code for better visuality.",5
My life has changed ever since I started using chatGPT. No more spending hours on mundane tasks and no more writers block because it takes care of almost everything.,5
"so intuitive, seamless. The only downside is that it's not easy to select a part of the text, rather than all of it..",5
"Wouldn't let me input my phone number for verification, It gave me an error that the help option didn't tell me how to deal with. Just said my Carrier wasn't supported, don't know why or what to do about it :/",1
"I'd love to engage and explore the new possibilities of this legendary life changing ai, but sadly, my phone carrier is not supported. Thanks for nothing.",1
I use this instead of Google search. It's very quick and easy to get accurate answers without having to sift through tonnes of useless SEO marketing garbage.,5
It's a really good and it's been so helpful. I gave a four - star because I can't merge the context and conversation from one session with another.,4
best app for homework and essays especially if you're tired and not wanting to do lots of thinking I've gotten A's / 7's in my subjects after using this app especially for the essays,5
"It's good and it provides everything you need but it's not real time and provide outdated information i.e till sept 2021, so i think it's high time to update the app. It's already sept 2023",4
"Wow🤩amazing experience, this will change the whole education system and more other section to become attractive and easily accessible everyone in very simple way. Great👍",5
"I greatly appreciate your assistance. However, I kindly request that you consider adding the option to modify the displayed name. Aside from that, everything is perfect. Thank you.",4
My issue with missing Microsoft authentication was fixed with an update available less than a day later. Thank you!,5
I love ChatGPT by OpenAI A LOT. Thank you for this!! It feels so light and has become my favorite app right at the moment I opened the app. I didn't expect the quality to be THAT excellent. 👏 😺💜,5
so far is amazing application. extremely helpful have to always seek the smartest in the room. sometimes it's hidden in your pocket.,5
It is best for students and it also helps student and teacher to generate answers for exam practice. I am also a student. I suggest this application for students.,5
"Every time I try to use it I get an error message that says ""network error......."" etc etc haven't been able to use it once, uninstalling now waste of time",1
My first computer was the Intel 80286 running DOS 3.1 with something called a DOS Shell for browsing files. And I just watched a movie and discussed it with ChatGPT and analysed it all on a phone. It's really amazing.,5
"So far it's good, user friendly, the interface is good and simple. But it would be nice if you guys can update it info base",5
"Finally, the wait is over! This app exceeded all my expectations. Its smooth performance, user-friendly interface, and rich features make it a must-have for everyone. Kudos to the developers for creating such an incredible and much-awaited app!",5
"I am delighted about the android ChatGPT app. I thought it would never become available to us, but it has. Now, we can access it more conveniently. Thank you, OpenAI!",5
"Great app other than the fact that 1.5 year old Galaxy S22 has support for Haptic feedback and the newer S23 doesn't, i could understand if S23 came out like a month ago but it's already out for half a year, and it uses the same Haptic sensor as S22, please add S23 support quickly!",1
One of the best ai app I have used so far. It's functioning is amazing! Works very smoothly and also answers whatever you ask. The answers are also the way I want it. Pretty good programming.,5

"fantastic, easy to use , pretty much you just talk to it as you would your subordinate, and as such you get intelligent descriptive and on point responses.",5
"Can't use it (my phone has dark theme enabled). When app is set to light theme - you will see code blocks, but not text; them app is set to dark theme you will see text but not code blocks.",1
★★★★★ ChatGPT is truly revolutionary! Its ability to understand and respond to a wide range of queries is unparalleled. Every conversation feels organic and insightful. A must-try for anyone interested in AI!,5

"It's so good!! Me and my wife using this app for a proper advice for our problems,and this app give us genuine causes , and their salution as well... and it's also explain about our problems why, and how it's happen.. one thing I mostly like it about this app, that is my wife ask some questions about accounts it gives us alwyas proper answers but when some of those things it doesen't know about it simply appologize that's the best thing about this app this app deserves 5 star.. keep doing it!!👏",5

Very good app but please make an update where we can upload pics and give captions for it. It would be very useful and life changing.,5
This is crazy good! I copied my CV in and let it do it's voodo. Within a couple of seconds my janky CV seems like it was written by a professional. Highly recommended for CV writing. 4 star because it only knows the world before 2021.,4
the app freezes after the first reply and cannot open the keyboard. been happening for the past 2 weeks.,2
Mesmerized by the standard of responses to the questions posed from varied domains of knowledge and skills. You just post it and ChatGPT has it all starting from a to z. Just keep asking about the topics that you choose and the language model will provide you convincing responses in the manner you desire. AI the New technological revolution ! Great 👍 Kudos to OpenAI,5
I honestly ought to have chat GPT right this review because my words pale in comparison to what chat GPT can do. I've been struggling with writing job descriptions and it took my gibberish and formatted it into clear concise thoughts that I feel confident will highlight my abilities and gain me an excellent position. And AND AND its FAST ASF,5
"The app is nearly perfect, but all it's missing is the ability to rewrite and/or delete previous comments like you can on the website",4
Worst app I am trying to signing up but the process of onboard is not completing I thought that it is a glitch but even after updating the app it is not working I haven't signed up yet please fix this problem.,1
I think it will be better if the icon colour is changed to some other colour from white and the app needs to work on the dark mode...it's not working properly,4
Great app. It helps me a lot with planning and such. One small problem: unlike with the website I cannot share the chats. Is this an upcoming feature?,4
"Smartest AI conversationalist yet. HOWEVER, It doesn't matter what I say or what or what custom rules I try to make this chat bot acts like a customer service chatbot following a very rigid script with her supervisor hovering over her ready to do some administrative damage if the AI sounds a little too human or genuine about anything.",3
"it understand the technical scientific ans philosphicla discussions much better , it gave me so many awnsers and it save a lot of time before that I had to research on topic online which takes hours and days but now chat gpt does it in minutes also it ia accurate, keep up the best work",5

The biggest fraud known. I am signing up and have only had one device it states to use the device I registered with... umm I only have one lol. Fake can't even login. Can't get an email to reset password. Just as fake as the .government that promises our privacy,1
Hasn't destroyed humanity yet so far so good. Seems pretty useful. The biggest downside is that it's limited to information from September 2021 and before then.,4

Excellent for a first time app. The app runs smoothly and works very well. AI models are very fascinating,5
"I like this app so much, it gives clear answers and knowledge about various subjects without wasting my time. i would suggest to add donate money through online payment gateway option, so people can help to maintain this service",5
Would be cool if you could format the responses ie a new line between each sentence would be easier to read than big blocks of text.,5
An AI response and what you are able to achieve is only as good as your creativity. I am happy with this app. It has allowed me to achieve efficiency I only dreamt of. 😊,5

Received a VERY scammy text sent by the same number the verification number when I downloaded the app. sent an email to the developer about it and was directed to their website which isn't helpful uninstalling!,1
i Give 4 stars because it stops working after a certain limit of messages. these limits can be removed for betterment . but the responses are quite satisfying.,4

"What I can only say is: ""This app is helpful and perfect for those who are struggling from summarizing like me. Accurate and direct to the point"" The best! 👍🏻",5
Good software but it's information must be more vast and up to date it's better if they do an information update every 6 months or ever 3 months or so but good app.,4

"GPT Team! Thank you very much for your precious time to develop such a brilliant app. For sure, it has increased my knowledge and also brought improvement in my email writing. Best of luck",5
Excellent app. it would be better if they could add more features like ai video editing and Photoshop,5

"Incredibly fast and accurate, the voice command option makes things much easier, waiting for Android pluggins 🤩",5
A really good AI that provides answers that can satisfy all of my questions. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for easy access to information.,5

honestly this is like the best app to use if you're struggling with academics or want more knowledge. there are detailed explanations about each topic and subject. I'm happy ti give this app a 5 star,5

"The problem is while writing something if I need to use backspace to correct a word, the space between previous words gets removed. It’s irritating.",3
Every time you open the app it starts new conversation. It's annoying to constantly switching to previous conversations,3
All good but the data is being fetched from last September 2021 only. It would be great if real-time data is also included.,4
ChatGPT is an incredible language model that can generate informative and engaging responses. It's impressive to see how far AI has come in understanding and generating human-like text.,5

"One of the greatest app ever created. It is helping a lot in my study now I don't have to research a lot on Google of any difficult topics,It is must have app for all students.",5
Amazing technology. I use GPT instead of Google search when I need a direct response to my question or when I struggle to phrase what I want to look up.,5
"if it could provide links to external websites and some of the data was updated (some responses are from data from Sept 21), it would be out and out 5 stars best ever app",4
"Tried to login, message it's that I'm blocked???? I'm even paying a monthly fee to keep this, why the app says I'm blocked, by cloudflare? (useless tool by the way, you can get much better).",3
"I can't log in because I'm using an unsupported browser. My daily web browser is Opera. In the next update, is it possible for me to be able to log in to my account using the Opera browser? Thank you and havd a great day!",1
"Needs more improvement. Chat GPT should be used as an Android Assistant. We want Chat Gpt as a replacement of current Android Assistant. Also needs to add talking feature in Chat Gpt. When we ask something, Gpt should be read the responses.",5
"Easy to access than browser but when using in dark mode, code section is not visible that is code section is in white color not able to see the code. Please fix these issue on dark mode settings of device asa well as app",2
"Currently, to access Pervious chats we need to go to History option. Please make Pervious Chats directly visible without having to go to History. (The the browser version)",3
"Don't want to create an account. I'll just stick with Google's AI. I refuse to create an account to use an app. Yeah, maybe it's an old school attitude, but that's how I do things. Uninstalling now.",1
"it's good, but could not meet my expectations.. after all it is an artificial intelligence which is made by humans, not a natural one. But expecting more advance in upcoming time.",3
"This app is amazing... I love it, it helps me to solve problems in shortest possible time frame, I salute the team that came together to do this for the world, I say thanks and GOD bless you all.",5

"It's an AI application, ehere every questions are answered and it has the information collected from diffrent websites and produce it before you ♥ Loved one with less memory space it has high benifits",5
This is the most amazing experience I took from a mobile app. It can sometimes be a good friend and offer great solutions to our human problems. A big thank you to the developers of this app.,5
It's is so cool (artificial intelligence) man .Like if I ask something it just give me the answer in a second.But it has limits of answering that makes bored 💤 sometimes.I hope developer will fix it.,5
"Love the app! It never leaves you without someone to talk to, and I find it quite helpful when trying to prioritize and strategize.",5
App is very convenient but...when it generate the words it make vibration continuously...and it's very annoying for me ..plz make option for that to off that vibrations..,4
"Rubbish, disappointing. Why does it appear, some of the key words and phrases in reviews, could have been AI generated? Have a read. Sus or what?",1
Edit: The app was fixed and properly shows an error message instructing me to disable my VPN. Did so and it worked. Thanks.,4

Started using it to help me find ideas for meals and it even provides step by step instructions on how to make them. I have loved the help it provides!,5
"Cannot log-in w/ email + password ; Using Brave browser redirect w/ shield off ; Android 9 ; As soon as I tap ""Continue"" -> webpage loads but remains at login screen w/ email and password typed in",1
I can access ChatGPT faster with this app. Please add the ability to have multiple conversations simultaneously (browser tabs).,5

"Very helpful for students especially the students of 1st and 2nd year... With the help of chatgpt We solve our match questions, other subjects assignments and anything we want.. Thanks..",4
It's perfect! Just be open-minded and you'll get the best out of this chatbot. It explains and helps you understand what it just explained to you. It's my teacher and my friend 😊 I'm a good student.,5
"I don’t see ChatGPT as AI tool, but rather as a friend. who helps me in every kind of situation in life. Lots of thanks to it's developers.",5
"Login does not work, probably something to do with running brave but I can't force the app to use a different browser and I don't want to uninstall brave just to get this login working.",1
"In general the app it's great like chat gpt web,but what bothers me it's the fact that it doesn't have information after 2021, which means it's becoming obsolete.",3
"Great app so far!!! I was waiting to take Chat GPT on the road with me. The all is simple, no fuss, I really like the design. Thanks 🙏",5
"Does NOT work. Can't login using any of the offered methods, or sign up. App says ""Something is wrong. Make sure you have the latest version of Google Play""",1
"the app overall is quite good, however I don't see any options to edit messages, like in the openAI eebsite . I still prefer the website version because of this.",4
"Sensational.. limitless conversation, no word count limit and above all, very satisfying and impressive responses 💯.",5
It is an absolutely great app... it will be an understatement to call it the best.... it helps you with everything.. Thank you to the team who made this great application...,5
It's very helpful for me as I am a student it's helps to give answers of those questions which I can never found on any other website/social networking sites and it gives the accurate information about which I ask him.,4
Very helpful. So far it's great. But there is poor answer when you ask chatGPT in Javanese language. The developers should learn Javanese language corectly or delete the language from ChatGPT or it will give wrong answer.,4
this app is helping me study my papers for exam and basically radically changed my academic life for the better. it's as if I have a teacher that I can ask questions from with me all the times.,5
This app has been so very beneficial to me. It helps me with my studies and servess as my go-to person when I am bored or when I need somebody to talk to . Everyone should try it out,5
One of the greatest tools of all time for personal education on matters you may need specific help in but Google would be too broad. Phenomenal.,5
When entering my phone number it takes an age to come through. When it comes through after several attempts it can not verify my number.... Please fix this so I can use the app,1
Very articulate and actually mind boggling. Thank you Open AI. You kind of simplified research to some extent.,5
"Can't login even google play service permission has given to access the phones, and if login success, apps can't be used to start (request error ... Please try later)",1
Nice but missing few desktop features. One most important feature is sharing a link to response. Why is it hard to put it in the app?,4
Love gpt in general. App needs the ability to edit previous comments like on the full site. Otherwise full experience in a sleek mobile interface.,4
"Its really good, everything, except for the fact that its knowledge only goes up to 2021! I do have to cut them some slack tho, making a freakin A.I. must be pretty hard.",3
"I love using ChatGPT, but this isn't really an app. It just opens Chrome and uses those assets. I can do the same with a bookmark, so uninstalled.",3
I tried conversing in my native dialect and the app understood and responded perfectly. Also informed me it can converse even if I mix it with english. The app knows Taglish very well!,5
"It's really helps with my spelling and punctuations, it's even more amazing when it comes up with captions for my food video tutorial.....",5
Excellent program. Very broad range of topics from science to world events and beyond. Very fast and accurate! 5/5,5
"It's continuously repeating the same errors, asked to list 10 four Letter palindromes. Check the items are really palindromes and 4 letter? Ask for again and again pointing the mistakes it continuously repeating the errors.",3
"Edit: This app is actually dumb to an extent. Can't even tell me time in a particular place, unlike other ai apps. Please try to improve the app experience and the AI intellect.",2
This is the best ai that could ever exist . Great features and good service even if you don't have the premium version👍🏻thank you.,5
"ChatGPT is a very much welcome option as an alternative to desktop. Hovevet, a text to speech function would be awesome! Please ...",4
Very great app providing fast response but there is just one feature which is lacking which is giving voice to chat gpt. Chat gpt should talk also I mean so we can listen to it instead of just reading,5
I've been waitng for this for a long time but I've asked ChatGPT a certain question and it informed me that it was last updated in Sep 2021 however my question needed answers which are current so we're humbly requesting the developers to update it. Thank you for the good work!,5
App is really light compared to the web version. Very breezy as a mobile app. I am loving it. I expect more features l.,4
"""I found the assistance provided to be helpful and informative. My questions were addressed accurately, and the interaction was satisfactory. Thank you!"" i said the gpt to write this i just pasted it",5
Working Great! Love the material design 😍 it would be great if it also supports monet (material you colors). That would be soo cool!,4
Give users a way to copy code from chatbox. web version has this functionality but app doesn't have this basic feature. This is so weird. 😓,3
Are we using this I from last one year and I have never faced such a problem that have faced just today your I is unable to do easy mathematics problems which I have given to it I have fixed at many times but that bug is not even fixing I hope this review is been saying by you and you will fix your program as earlier as possible thank you,1
"No way to edit previous messages, this makes it just a bad wrapper in native app to web interface that didn't yet reached feature parity",2
"Totally can't log in, saying that my phone number has been maxed out of verification during my first time log in attempt. Wait for more than 24 hrs, same thing .",1
"Revolutionary AI-Powered Experience - The Artificially Written Review! - This is the first review of this app on Google Play Store ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ As a technology enthusiast, I couldn't resist being one of the first to try out the ChatGPT Android app, and boy, was I blown away! This app marks a groundbreaking step in the realm of AI-powered communication.",5
"It's amazing! But please remove the loading animation next to the message option when Chatgpt is still typing, it looks annoying.",4
Installed the app and verified my email... Stops me at phone number verification cause it isn't in my country yet. Had high hopes for this but damnit. Will update my rating once these services reach Zimbabwe ‼️‼️,1
"Failure. Screen only showing ""Oops! Something went wrong"" after entering login+password. Already tried several different accounts but Failure always",1
"ChatGPT is incredibly useful as it offers a powerful and versatile language model that can assist users with a wide range of tasks. From answering questions and providing information to generating creative content, its natural language understanding and generation capabilities make it an invaluable tool for enhancing communication and problem-solving in various domains.👍",5
"very fast, simple interface,answers in very less word,but I think not more creative.",4
Too intrusive before you even start. If you like jumping through endless hoops before being able use an app. Go for it.,1
"Excellent Experience. It would be great if you could add some more options in custom instructions, allow usage of markdowns to users , And some other setting's to manage important things (e.g New Chat After Reopening: Yes/No)",5
I found a bug on the dark/light theme. On dark theme you can't read code. On light theme you can't read words. Its easily fixable. I'm trying to login now by openai to find the source code for the Android app,4
"I would really hate it like its the fact that you certainly need to be 13+ yrs old to play/use,im just 11 yrs old man, ive got a school project film for 5 goddamn minutes and i just want the AI to write a 5 goddamn minute script,MAKE IT 11+ YRS OLD!!",1
"I couldn't find the option to login with my Microsoft Account. I already have a chatGPT account with my outlook account. Also, why does this Android app have a ""login with Apple"" prompt?",3
"The design and app experience is the killer, it's very smooth with simple and easy interface",5
"This is a very good app, in my opinion.I like how the app gives every answer correctly.But the only flaw is that it should be updated because it was updated last in 2021,21 september,which is 2 years ago.",5
"The ChatGPT Android app is a powerful conversational assistant that brings the renowned GPT-3.5 language model to the palm of your hand. Its ability to understand context, answer questions, and generate human-like responses is truly impresive.",5
I use this daily for both personal and my jobs. I have the pro version. and so far this is life changing. it's a great tool to learn,5
"Sorry to say, but this app has data stored till September 2021 which is very old and not very useful. Developers need to improve this.",2
Yes this is really helpful. It has surprised me from my first experience only. But I don't feel great as it can't show images. Please check it,4
I've waited and keep watching the preregister Chatgpt for over 30 days and now it's available for my device I have downloaded it but it keeps showing me no compertable browser application installed but I have installed Google Chrome and other supported browsers but still no response,1
I have to say is the app is overall simple light and awesome but I have to say that chat gpt have to integrate the gallery option also then we can upload image and ask the questions plse do this asap bcoz i am the digital content creator and I know that how useful is that,4
It's a place to search 🔍 for good stuff and helps in reducing the time for researching and create good answers without clicking on any link. It is better than Google,5
"It was fine for the first one or two months, but since a few days it is not responding. I am having a lot of problems, please solve this problem as soon as possible. Excuse me for my terrible english!!!",2
"Hi, can someone please help me bc for some reason it won't let me sign into the app every time it tells me to put my email and information for me to sign in it always says it going to send me a code but it never does and I have tried so many times and also checked my Gmail but there's nothing there.PLS HELP🙏 I REALLY WANNA USE THE APP.",1
"Can't login. The login page works, but every time I put in the correct credentials, it brings me back to the login page.",1
"90% of anything you look up it says it can't find it. app says any info from 2021 - 2023 (present) it is not programed to give info on... why? Biden? This app, it is for those who ask no relevant questions and are easily amused and lead astray... does this describe you? 👉🐑👈 My first review got edited to make this app look good, re-did this review to the original post... and will keep a eye out for any changes in my post... 🌻",1
The best ai-virtual advisor or tutor that help me gives an answer to get into difficult times for understanding complex concepts that are very hard to understand topics to learn and grasp an intuition to it,5
It's solve most of the problem but nowadays it has started giving many errors. I spent 30minutes understanding later I asked it again and it said sorry for the error 🤷,3
"I can't even access the app, it's asking me to install Google Chrome when I already have Google Chrome in my phone. I even updated my Google Chrome app and it's still not working",1
"it should allow to upload or export search results in different types offline or online like word, pdf, one drive or Google drive for later search also have option to create folders in search history to catagories search.",5
I ask questions and it always tells me I'm wrong until the very last sentence. please fix this. I hate feeling like a failure after all the effort I put into studying.,4
The app is sooo good but everything you do is automatically lost if you leave the app... You will have to start from the beginning The Inventors of the app should work on it,3
"After updating this app,it takes too long or doesn't tell the answer saying that I'm having a network issue,but other apps are working fine. Please fix this problem. Edit: the problem is not there now.",5
Adding a feature where you can scan an image or words using your camera would make it even better otherwise its a really awesome app,4
Same question on web version and app. Test many times and same result. On app always the worst answer on anything. I don't if is only me or others have the same problem.,2
Only time will tell how this app is going to evolve with just the chat feature it is so powerful enough already. Only time will tell how dangerous yet great and beautiful it is going to become in the coming years.,5
How can even I have an opinion if I am not able to login in the app. Very frustrating. Tried ao many times. Enough! Uninstalling.,2
"after new apdate ther is no flexibility while using it, many times showing network issu but before the updated it worked properly with quick response. please fix it",2
It's really good app and it's free but some places I ask that she doesn't to answer about San Jose in Philippines can you updated you're app with access internet so he can answer it's really good app 9/10 but she's doesn't answer my question about San Jose,3
IT DOESN'T SHOW WHAT CHATGPT VERSION THAT I'M USE HERE. IT'S JUST SHOW ChatGPT. I don't have access to real-time information as my knowledge cutoff date is September 2021.,1
A higly useful and user friendly app it communicates with us as if it is a human i like the responses given be Chat Gpt and it is not Confusing even a bit perfectly suits me It clarified my doubts efficiently. Highly recommend to use this app . Excellent app by open AI😃😃😃😃❤,5
I'm a paid member and can't sign in with my outlook email. Type in the email and password and nothing. * I'll update my review when a fix is provided.,1
"ChatGPT isn't very fond of VPNs, rip to the people in countries with restrictions. And no, I won't contact support just to be left on read.",1
It's the best app ever! It really helps me when I need help. But they can make their ChatGPT website look better. Overall it's the best,5
"For some reason when I want to sign in or log it it just sends me to a site where it says oops, and I can't open it. When you fix this problem I will give 5 stars",3
"Can't use. Always poped up that make sure my device has the latest version of Google play. However, I can make sure that everything is latest.",1
"Pretty cool Lite version of the web version. Though the formatting is weird and somewhat inconvenient, but overall, pretty decent",4
"Try and integrate the web browser version to this app, for GPT 4 to have plugins, beta code interpreter, uploading of files. Basically a user should feel like they are using their web browser. So far the app is GOOD.",4
Please provide cut and paste option and to copy all the question and answers in a single take .because it is copying only one specific answer at a time .make this possible to copy all answers at a time make it to pdf file . please provide to create pdf option.over all it is a revolutionary step in AI,4
"Just Amazing. The only downside is that it doesn't have information after 2021. So should be updated. Still, very very handy!",5
I use ChatGBT as a tutor and personal assistant for enhancing upon my learning journey. It can be a great guide to assist your learning.,5
"I am so grateful to the creators of this app. Actually, I am a student in grade 11, I read the model answers of literature critical analysis. And they are very informative and to the point. Thanks again.",5
it helps a lot... i didn't find any flaws so far. Expecting search results up to 2023 year. it shows results upto September 2021 only.,4
"Amazing app, been waiting for it to be available on Android, and I'm loving it. It's much easier now to use than having to go to the website or use it only on an iPhone.",5
Absolutely revolutionary tool that can potentially help every aspect of your life. And it's so simple to use!,5
Please add right-to-left mode to the web and application version; our language is Farsi and it is very annoying that your program and site do not have right-to-left mode!,1
Great app ever. It can do the same work in 20 minutes which I can do in 2 hours. The response time is very fast. Now we don't have to find the topics related to our studies on Google for hours.,5
"ChatGPT's mobile version is as good as the web version, no doubt! I've been a fan of this AI tool since its launch in 2022.",5
"I had struggled at a question about unit calculation since a several week, but this system helped me understand how the calculcation worked. Nice system, 10 stars.",5
"The app is amazing! But, sometimes it's a bit tricky to copy some texts manually.",5
Very useful for writing scripts if you're working in IT. No ads so that's a plus too.,5
It's not more than just a bot. Initially I was Highly impressed but later on I realised it's just a pattern identifier nothing else....no intelligence at all.,1
"So this is perhaps CHAT-GPT 3, right? But you have not told that in the app description. Well, though CHAT-GPT 3 is actually outdated but not bad for the general purpose.",3
Love the LLM site version but cannot have TTS nor STT. Want a version like third-parties. And the code interpreter doesn't workin it. Buggy and slow for pixel pro 7. Android 13&14,1
What a great way to integrate the enneagram and narrative counseling. Love the structure and guidance with regards to content and flow.,5
"I like how informative-free this app is, it gives exactly what you seek as it is. For now it's running perfect for me, I also hope it's going to on a long run",4
sometimes it makes mistakes with given facts...so it's hard to solve problem properly... don't forget to double check it's ans if you are trying to solve any calculation.,4
"It's great, but I wish it didn't forget our conversation cause I afto keep repeating myself whenever I use the app for a specific reason other than that it's great",4
"try this out, though it has a memory of its own like a human being. it automatically uploaded a profile of a picture i took many years ago and i do not even have it on my galary. be careful what you share on the app",4
"Everything is good ...""But this app is updated only until 2021, and it should also be able to reply with photos along with text.""",5
"It's worthy it, My travelling companion, A friend who answers my questions without getting angry, non matter the number of times I ask. Objective and fair answers",4
"The ChatGpt app is very slow to answer any question, if you ask the same question on your ChatGpt website, you get the answer immediately, but it takes a little time. Please resolve this issue.",3
"For some reason I'm unable to log in with any google account, my device is a Pixel 6 with Brave Browser. Update: Problem was fixed, thank you",5
"its far better than Google, I was able to learn new language and new phrases within weeks its awesome and easy to use loved it! highly recommended to download and register in openai website Thank you",5
"It is not suitable for Huawei HarmonyOS system, so the score is not high, and full marks cannot be given. I hope it can be improved in the future.",3
"The app needs update cause it shows that The ai has data upto 2021 September only ........but what about the dates after that. We're in 2023 and it needs to be. Updated to new Information....,...",5
It is good but it doesn't give an explicit answer and the worst thing is at times I will ask question on it. it will not work saying that no internet connection and in which I have a very good internet connection,3
"Loved it. haven't seen any problems for the past 2 weeks. and it can answer every question I ask and every answer is right. as long as the question is appropriate. overall, this is a 5. I loved it",5
I would like the app to look identical as the website. The font is not same. It looks cheap. Please make the app match the style and appearance as the website.,1
"you can't even use chatgpt 4 even if you pay for it, you can't edit your messages, you can't go back to different regenerated responses. It just doesn't have enough features",2
No doubt ChatGPT is great and now it is available in application form but one thing that i can disappoint me that it's not able to provide any information before September 2021,4
ChatGPT is an amazing App. It is fast and user friendly. Kudos to OpenAI and all developers working hard to make the world a better place.,5
Best and most productively usefull app in my device 🤩. I like the fast and clean UI very much. Also history off option is a bonus 🎁. 🫂🫂🫂 Loving it ❤️.,5
best ai in my whole life. I would thank the developers that they have made such a good ai for our use it solve each and every question I'm stuck with and it makes many topics easy which my teachers cannot explain me.,5
It is one of the best things ever happened since the discovery of Internet. It helps me refine and articulate wonderfully my work.,5
"honestly this app is okay and good but something rlly bad happened to me,im a jhs student and i usually use chatgpt for like inspiration and for ideas for my projects or assignments and like after i finish my project which i used like half of the words from chatgpt since i had alot of projects piled up and i didnt have time to do it properly.and so when i got to school i literally saw someone with the same answers as me like what and its so obvious too we literally both had the same answers 💀?",2
"great, can you also add a feature in which we can talk to chatgpt , like a phone call, like we can have some verbal discussion. I was thinking to do same, but if i did so based on your apis, and later on you did the same, obviously you can do it far better than i can.",5
"Perfect, just what I was looking for 👏👌 Free to use, unlimited messages and the AI is very helpful.",5
"ChatGPT is one of the best AI language model developed by OpenAI. ChatGPT is insanely good at generating human-like responses to queries and solving problems through textual conversations, but one disclaimer from OpenAI is that, like any AI language model, ChatGPT can sometimes generate harmful or offensive text, so some care should be taken when using",5
"""Wow, I'm blown away by this AI app! 🤩 It's incredibly smart and helpful, providing accurate and timely information on various topics. From answering complex questions to assisting with daily tasks, this AI app has become my go-to digital companion. The natural language processing is seamless, making interactions feel like chatting with a knowledgeable friend. I'm truly impressed with its capabilities and how it adapts to my preferences.",5
"User friendly UI, this has been so useful. The hassle of logging into the web is now sorted.",5
I have been using OpenAI and ChatGPT for a while now and have been searching for the android client. I am so excited to finally have a client application on my device. 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩,5
"Have chatgpt talk to your google home. Don't know what music you're looking for? Give chatgpt the vibe you want, it'll think of a song or playlist and can give google the command. (Obviously you may need to tell it how to ask google to do something ie ""hey google..."") That doesn't even cover the incredible dalle3 images it can make for you with natural language requests (no need to learn special prompt syntax) I could go on...if it can't do something.. it'll help you figure it out 😁",5
"I love this app! Thank God that OpenAI finally released the ChatGPT Android app. I love that it's quick, it's easy to use, and it's responsive. Definitely this app is better than visiting the site.",5
"From a long time i was waiting for open ai to introduce app and it is finally here. Hope open ai will never introduce ads in app ,which makes any website and app worst.",5
"Great, please continue to improve it and it's inaccuracies but I'm glad you guys inform that it can be inaccurate especially when some people might rely on it for medical information and whatnot.",5
"ChatGPT is a helpful language app, but it may not always give perfect answers. It can improve with updates. Good Luck OpenAI. Hopefully AI will be 😌.",4
"It's pretty smooth, but it'd really like to see the edit and delete features from the main site added in",3
"Nice App Gives what ever we want like songs , letters but the minus points is that is can't do any videos or images apart from that it's a very nice app",5
They fixed the problem so I upgraded the rating but the problem now is you need to make it so you can use Google translate from the select text page,4
"Very good overall, but please fix the bug where it is not possible to double-tap a word to select it.",4
"good app and accessible with screen readers, thanx for this job. just, hope if you can add code copy button, to help screen reader users copy the codes, also try to make the selection accessible with the screen readers. overall it is a very good app.",5
It's the Greatest❤️.It should have voice talk and also voice effects so we use which voice we like. it will help so much.,5
"Efficient, premium feel than being at browser , access to history offline, copy past option (customized), fast and more responsive",5
"The ChatGPT Android app shows great promise as a powerful language model, but it has a significant flaw. When writing code, the font color and background are both white, making it difficult to read the code. This inconvenience affects developers who rely on the app for coding assistance. However, the app's natural language processing capabilities are commendable for general language-based queries. Fixing the code font issue would greatly enhance the app's appeal and make it a must-have tool for",4
"It Makes Everything Easy 1. Answer questions on a wide range of topics. 2. Provide explanations and information on various subjects. 3. Help with language-related tasks like writing, grammar, and word suggestions. 4. Assist with mathematical calculations and problem-solving. 5. Offer recommendations for movies, books, or places to visit. 6. Engage in casual conversation and chat about different topics.",5
"Well I don't know but doesn't recognize my voice, it says transcription error and I don't know why, please if any of you can help me out!!!",4
"ChatGPT is an incredible language model that I have found extremely helpful. Its ability to generate coherent responses and provide relevant information is impressive. The AI's versatility in answering a wide range of questions and engaging in meaningful conversations is commendable. However, there are occasional limitations and inaccuracies, as it relies on pre-existing data. Nevertheless, ChatGPT is an invaluable tool for obtaining quick information and engaging in interactive discussions.",5
"Overall, ChatGPT is a powerful language model that offers valuable support and assistance, but it's always a good idea to verify critical information from other sources when needed.",5
I'm just enjoying my conversation here with Alicia I just give this up a four star because it's so difficult to have a conversation with an AI that has no identity but it's fun I guess so I'll talk to you to use this app and that's it I guess,4
Amazing 🤩 app! It can provide information about any topic like assignment or any type of question 1000 times faster than browsers. Best app found on playstore,5
"Hi, I am very impressed for this application but one thing it gives only words not images so, provide contents with images.",4
"This app is very reliable to be used on android as i don't have to open it in a web browser, other than that i think this could be improved by adding more features with ease of user interaction .",4
It is really good! but it can be much better why I said this is because see it you the text but when I asked for pictures it didn't show a response,4
Everything is good in Chat GPT but it is not connected to live internet. Also sometimes it make very silly mistake causes incorrect results.Moreover The way of explanation is also wonderful 😊.,4
It is too much good app .it provides a solution to any kind of problem whether it is related to a subject or technology or business or management . I love it,5
chat gpt is good source of knowledge. but the maker should some other option like when a question about science or technology is then it should give the diagram or photos related to that search,5
"Excellent application, fulfills what it promises. No ads or difficult to use interfaces.",4
It lacks a lot of the features the website has but it is a good start. For now I'll stick to using the links created by brave on my home screen. The design is clean and smooth. Please add the pro features.,3
"I loved this app and its interface. I appreciate the time, effort and skill set they applied in making this beautiful application.",5
It's the best ai app but please Open Ai team update it to the latest version and knowledge and introduce new features such as generating pictures according to the user preference and some audio generation and i use it everyday,5
Excellent! I can use this app very well but would like some other features as well like taking photos and showing it to chatgpt for more info or answer,4
"I have been using ChatGtp for last 3 months, it's just an amazing experience. You should add 'Edit' feature.",5
Having constant network issues. I uninstalled and reinstalled now it refuses to log me in. It's great when it works though.,2
"It's a beautiful experience. and just need to include pictures, scanner,etc.",4
I think I am the first person writing review about chatgpt.a good app nedd some quality fixes and other than that everything is going fine. I think this might be the next brainstomer of app .best of luck to all developers and open ai.have a nice beginning.,4
"Lately ChatGPT has been bugging out. Either it refuses to give you a response, or it gives you an incorrect response or a response from a previous question asked.",1
Really this application is fantastic but if you question it respons to long otherwise it is good. I really impressed by the speed of giving the answers.,5
The phone verification is limited to two accounts only and even if you delete the accounts you can't anymore use that phone number. What a dumb verification method you use,1
"The app is simple but functional, it would be great if you could add text to speech to read the answers please.",4
Let us take a step forward into the new world we will create with AI. Too good. Maybe Android app seems better than iOS app. Let's reap what previous generation have sown and make the sowing take care on its own.,5
It's so much easier to use and just how the results of what you search for are laid and answered is just AMAZING!👌 I highly recommend it,5
"Unfortunately they still have not added Internet access back. Until then I can't imagine using it as a search replacement. The system is impressive, but the lack of up to date quarries is problematic.",2
"For first time usage, the app is good the whole ui is good but it could be better. Also sometimes the app crashes after long usage session.",4
"still missing code interpreter, plugins, and all other features that you know and love. whisper works great, though!",4
"This app isn't worth even a single star, It's first instance responses are absolute rubbish, It says everytime ""I am sorry you are correct"" even when you give it a false information, don't go for it, Truly discontent",1
"Update: The login is now working (though I had to try multiple times) The app itself works great, like the web app. Fast responses etc",4
Wow amazing app can ask all kinds of doubts. But can you add the new voice search feature to Android too.That would be nice . except that everything is superb,5
"Unable to log in despite uninstalling, reinstalling, restarting the phone, etc. I can log in via browser, but the app seems to be broken",1
Fantastic app! I love how ChatGPT provides quick and helpful responses. It's been a valuable tool for me. Highly recommended!,5
"Its just amazing.💕 Chatgpt gives us comfort on everything. I have done many tasks using this Ai tool and believe me , its results are unbelievable.✨",5
"It was great, but 4 stars right now because everytime i ask a numerical or mathematical formula it will only list as text not as a math formula should be so i kinda confused from the explaining",4
It's unnecessarily censored for a lot of topics but if you can phrase it weird enough you can bypass it. Not a fan of being treated like a child but most topics don't seem to have been politicized.,4
"Love everything about this app. Everything is top notch, from UI, ease of use to incredibly fast response time.",5
"I love that I am like universally, uniquely, gifted with special scenarios like being unable to sign in to the app for hours but website is no problem..",1
It's really great AI..You can ask literely ANYTHING and it gives you accurate answers. I didn't caught it giving inaccurate information most often.,5
"this is a good start. anybody can learn for the noble good, just be more prolific in the terms of data correction although it is the best app I've ever seen or ever rated 5 stars",5
chat GPT is something unique and special. The aquired results purely depends upon your method of evolving with it. query results are just beyond imagination. u can use chat GPT for wonderful results.,5
"After waiting for a long time, I finally got it as an app 😊 It is really very helpful and much faster and smoother than using it from browser. I am free plan user and satisfied with it 😊 Recommended for those who used to use browser. Don't listen to negative reviews.",5
"Brilliant AI chat, a must-have! Smooth, helpful, and simply delightful. But sometimes it's fail. Love it",4
"Well, when it comes to AI, the only key performance you can rely on is your prompts. but it's a great tool !",3
"This is not GBT 4, it's only 3.5. I can't even access my subscription for Plus users. The so called big roll out features are completely absent from this app.",1
it's fun! ironically it's ability is limited by your own creativity. I'm still trying to figure out new fun things to ask!,5
"It's a beta. Doesn't have the full gpt 4 models selection, doesn't render code sections, basically no reason to use this over the web ui",3
perfect for studying and to review things for example if I understand some concept I try to explain it to him and check any mistakes and provide more detailed explanation it's wonderful,5
"I've been using the ChatGPT Android app for a while now, and I am absolutely blown away by its capabilities. This app has become an indispensable tool in my daily life for various reasons.",5
"👍 love the fast response that allows us to express our creativity, without loose the professional quality required when communicating with our clients, employers and friends, without lack of transparency or sending messages that may be confusing or misleading. THE FUTURE is here and chatGPT send us to meet you there",5
This app is a blessing to all the students out there. but one thing about it is that this isn't updated for the 2023 version it's only upto 2021. 🤥,4
"I use the app mostly for language learning by asking it for correcting my sentences and explaining grammar issues, I must say it works pretty well.",5
"Love This Friendly App. Very Time Savy,& Gives 99.99% accurate & to the Point Response/Solutions. But it need Many More Information to be Update in it... But it's Already Very Benifitial.",4
Couldn't sign in at all...the auth window kept on loading...and then suddenly sign in error page appears saying that phone's date and time are incorrect.,2
Very Good app. Very helpful in getting the accurate information. Finally launched in Play store. We need the upgrade plus ..I hope it will be launch very soon.,5
"Fantastic, no ads, clean ui, good voice module, everything from desktop has been brought over, amazing job.",5
"Amazing. More concise, informative, and helpful than using ad-cluttered Google search for information.",5
"Best AI ever , it produces good responses and to the point answers , it also is helpful for preparing essays , summarieas and many other things. Overall it's the best AI ever",5
"this is great! but needs more work. they say that this is just a fraction of what the AI is capable of, so you can wonder how the elites must be manipulating us with AI! 🤔",5
This is such an amazing and helpful app to those students who struggles in english like me. I will definitely give this a 5 stars. Deserve!,5
"It's good and much more neater than the website but there is no button to copy code when I want to, which is really frustrating.",4
I came to know about chatgpt before two to three months when everyone in YouTube and other social media platform were talking about chatgpt .... and when I started using this i will shocked... later this is proved to solve all my problems such as searching a good website or mobile app for any particular purpose..and more importantly in solving my subject related queries 💭 in exact the same way as I want to ..... this open a.i. tool is working like a magic 🪄,5
Perfect app or computer program..... Gave answer every question by fast and in easy word's 💯💯💯.......I recognize this app in the big bridge..........👍👍😊😊😊 Thanks for making app and for help the people.....,5

"You can write letters, emails, story, poetry and many more with the help of Chatgpt within the blink of an eye. The most important fact is it is fast.",5
This chat bot has a opinion regardless if it argues it does not it can't deal with anything outside it's biases and will contradicts it self frequently . It can't offer anything useful if it's not reliable as well,1
Really enjoying that it's now available as an app. I especially like that there's a speech to text feature.,5
"It's incredible I enjoy it so much I think it helps , it gives concise amount of information. Just what you need to know about a certain subject",5
"""ChatGPT app is a mind-blowing language genius! From learning to fun chats, but it forgot previous chat, AI must have ability to remember previous history of particular account",3
"I love ChatGPT in the way it helps me learn a lot on my own, not just academically, but also other life skills and knowledge.",5
This app is so helpful to me. I ought to have discovered it for long. It has greatly improved my understanding of Advanced Audit and Assurance,5
ChatGPT is an outstanding application that finally allows quick chat without having to dive into my Web browser.,5
This app is like a guide that can teach you almost anything. AI is the future and this gives us the glimpse of the exact future.,5
I want to have the same chats open as on desktop. Else i have to go each time to history to find them. If this gets fixed 5 stars for sure!,4
The last update on the app that was released few days ago is September 2021. That's bad and not recent. Pls fix or update to real time information.,2
It's actually an amazing app... I've been following Open AI for about a yr now and I think what they've done has actually changed the world as we know it(even the robot/AI take over the world aspect),5
It is a very useful app where you can get every information that you want . It is useful app for students,5

"Helpfull application especially for the writer content or hotel and tourism industrial service in translate to any language in the world and keep up the good work, thanks",5
"The ChatGPT ap is really amazing. So when I am not able to access charge GPT from my computer I have to use my Android device. So I had to access ChatGPT from Chrome. But after installing this app, the experience is super good 🔥 But I've a suggestion if you ask me. 📌 Please consider bringing the esit button on the prompt in the application as the web version have. It's really helpful and visually appealing app and the edit button can skyrocket the users demand fulfilment.",5
"This app is very useful for any person who can use it as a tool for various needs like gaining knowledge,information,for analysis of texts and many more.",4
chat gpt is a very wonderful tool to add to your collection should you be a dungeon master looking to get inspiration a writer suffering from writing block or a goofball looking for something fun to mess around with.,5
I'm just waiting for ChatGPT and Google Bard to add microphone buttons so I can just sit back and listen to them talk to each other into oblivion. 🤣,5
"The app is just stuck at the beginning with that gray circle, I tried to clear cave then data but it still the same problem.",1
"It's completely amazing, I still remember the launch of gpt-2 and gpt-3, it's incredible the progress in only few years!",5
The app is good. The flaws is the data base limitations. The data base should be updated till 2023. A sort of real time data base update should be imbibed,2
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 best chatgpt ai out there!! it gives me accurate answers! hope they will add features like indentifying photos.. but overall this app was great and neat.,5
ChatGPT is quite an interesting app so far. it's helped me in a quite number of things and makes research less stressful. I find great relief with this app. Kudos 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,5
"App's great, tho can you add a feature to pin a chat or atleast and easy access to chat history it's annoying going back anytime to the history",5
"Great! This is just like the ChatGPT app for iOS, but it's for Android. I'm one of the first reviews, but we finally have this and I'm so excited to use the app and try it for the first time. I like how, unlike all the fake ChatGPT apps out there on the Play Store, this doesn't keep asking you to pay and the free plan is good enough. Overall, this is a nice app mostly because ChatGPT is so smart and this is free. I hope this becomes better!",5
"Is incredible! ChatGPT free, But no is valery :( Aslo, are very strange the Super-GPT, And the GPT-5 are very advance, And, in my opinion, the app are worst, Dolls are better.",1
i would say this is better than the site ver... it's easy to copy the whole text in my phone...the only problem is it doesn't save my conversations..pls help pr fix,4
"I just can't explain how good this AI is. It can write crazy answers for my university's projects, crazy in making sentences to express myfeeling to my crush, crazy in making sentences in my native language hindi. What else do you need it for 😂.",5
"I simply don't know how I lived my entire life without this. I stopped using Google, cuz this has better answers to any questions I might have. Can't wait for a premium subscription so I can get access to 4.0.",5
It's ChatGPT. It's hard to rate any AI other than Bard at the same level as this. Also the app has vibrations which are cool.,5
It's almost as good as a browser one. But it doesn't give an option to edit the request that was sent.,4
Great ai assistant. But there's one problem that it doesn't recognize anything or any event after 2021 which is really disappointing.,4
"It is such a good application, I am forever grateful it solves all my doubts of all sub no matter what it has shown a positive impact in my life even though it may take jobs or whatever but it deserves a lot of appreciation, I'm so grateful... thanks a ton...",5
"""A Game-Changer in Conversational AI!"" ChatGPT has truly revolutionized the way I interact with AI. ChatGPT is always ready to assist with accurate and relevant answers.",5
"perfect ever seen app on earth. it's very fast, no ads, uses extremely less data🙏💞🥰❤️",5
This is a nice app but it doesn't have latest data it was last updated at September 2021 from then it doesn't have any data about the world,3
"This isn't subscription free like a review states, first thing the app does is require you enter your Google account details /apple Id etc and then it asks for your phone number which is suspect af. Guaranteed, all the wordy 5 star reviews were made by the Dev's AI 😂👿",1
"Can't get better than this! Finally, it's available on Android! Apple products usually get everything VIP, but anyway, I'm happy that Android now has chatgpt app too.",5
"This app only has information up until September 2021. It'll be nice if we get an up to date version. Having said that, it's still very helpful",4
Great! It provides detailed answers on most questions and the answers feel like (if you don't know that it is ai) an actual person typing it!,5
"I would love to get into this app but I can't get past the sign up screen because it's saying that my phone number is a landline number, which it is NOT a Landline, it's my CELLPHONE number..",1
"App saying, compatible browser for login not found even though I have Microsoft Edge browser (only) in my phone. Interfere not going any further.",1
Doesn't seem to work with my VPN. Keeps creating a network error. Not happy that I need to shut it off to use it.,3
"I love this app but I keep getting ""Sorry, we're having issues right now, please try again later"" in every time I try to talk to ChatGPT. Is there any way to fix that? Please help",2
I think I'm third person to rate this app. Amezing news for Android users. ChatGPT is working seemlessly. Just disappointed to see that GPT4 pluggin support is not yet available,4
"Need a back option when in history, then click in to one to see something, the back button closes the app! Rather than going back the the history 🤷🙄",2
Many times it states having older data or knowledge back till September 2021 only and suggests to check latest updates. Didn't expect this from an AI.,3
"Very, very helpful and smart answers to any question or problems. Loving it. It's a wonder of modern AI.",5
"I really like chat gpt. There are a lot of these types of application, but this one I like the most. I really thanks to that person who had made this application. Once again thanks",5

"It's really great and superb with extreme service.I am feeling lucky to use it in pre-register.Hope,developers will bring 4.0 very soon.This is truly amazing experience for the android users.Great wish for your long journey.",5
I am impressed by what is offered for free here. I feel it tries to push Google Chrome on you for the initial login. Brave browser worked and that was preferable for me.,4
"Chat gbt made this text ""Thank you, OpenAI, for creating ChatGPT! I'm impressed with the quality of responses and the assistance I've received. It has made my experience on Google Play Store more enjoyable. Five stars!""",5
"Hello. I need help Last week I was ablt to install this app in may HUAWEI PAD AIR and it worked. However, today it is not working so I uninstall it and was abt to install it again... But this time. I cannot install it on my tablet Huawei matepad air. Pls help. I hope it will work again in my tablet. Thanks",2

"Fast, responsive and simple interface so far. Works great.",5

"I'm just glad the app is finally available for easy access. I do hope with more updates to come, their will be improvements rather than complains from users.",5
Its too much useful and time saving easy to command on every type of study material its a very very useful and excellent app👌👌👌👌👌,5
Docked one star due to having to tap the microphone everytime you want to verbally communicate. Being able to converse verbally would genuinely be a game changer!,4
"Extremely helpful, solves all the questions in mathematics perfectly so far and explains them really well too.",5
The speed and content of the responses from this app are surprising good! I've tried several other ChatGPT apps before but this one is definitely my favorite!,5
"It is a very good app that answers almost all questions correctly with detailed information. No ads, No premium 😊😊😊 Thanks for this great app.",5
its good! but I don't like when I'm trying to get information from here and it says error of some sort. it's quite disturbing :(,4
Please make this accurate its so understanding AI but calculation and logics not much better if I start mathematics properties its not giving right answer I mean this having very good theme and communication but less accuracy and logics And you can make this real time informative,3
"Faster than the site, but haven't markdown code sintax highlights, extremely bad text selection, haven't abort function, and the history is poorly located, it is necessary to open the drawer and put it on a button to only then see the history... very bad",2
I liked this app a lot it helped me a lot but if you add a feature that it can draw. I would be very happy.,4
"Good experience in app and app ui design is best and minimal and colorful, and the app size is under 5 MB, so I like it because I used the chrome extension but now app is available there for my productivity goes batter.",5
"Best app made also by the same AI Company. Very helpful for problem solution but need also include the ""Regenerate Response"" feature like from the website in order to rewrite the ai the responses.",5
Its really a helpful companion for all kinds of persons.. it helps me out on a lot of things... Much appreaciation and love to the developers!!,5
Chatgpt is Really a reliable source of information. Very thankful for the Creative director who make this thank you so much. Now I will not worrying where I could get a Data where the source is reliable unlike other apps,5
"This AI app is through the roof, so far its accurate on every question i ask and it give me various tips on how to do those stuff, its absolutely amazaing, the best AI app i have ever seen",5

"- In a world that's rapidly embracing artificial intelligence, ChatGPT stands out as a true marvel. This conversational AI has left an indelible mark on the way we interact with technology, making our lives more convenient . This time saving also",5
"Doesn't work. All I get is ""something went wrong"" followed by ""Update Google Play"" Which is already running the latest version. It's a pity.",1
It is totally garbage. I can't login my account. Every time I go to login to my account the error message is showing even showing the full html.,1
Two complaints. App looks very native to Android because of following material 3 design language. But app hasn't enabled dynamic coloring handled by Android monet which would be a nice thing to see. Themed icon for chat gpt will be nicely welcomed. Else the app is really good with great haptics. Love it,4
"Once downloaded, created profile. Logging in, app freezes then closes. Uninstalled and reinstalled, same results. Please advise",1
I've been waiting to download this app ever since I heard about it and til it came out to Android and IOS. This app is amazing for my school work and my everyday use.,5
What a technology really helpfull and helping us to do many things. I can do mony things using chatGPT and it's a very good option for those who are finding advise...,5
UI hasn't any problem.. It is cool and answers well but there is a wrong with adding new chats and restarting application.. Looking for a new update soon.,4
Great app but will not let me log in/sign up/etc. Have deleted and redownloaded the app a couple times and cleared cache and nothing has helped,1
Just wrote the most amazing cover letter that I could never write. Absolutely love this app and I just downloaded it.,5
Seems really good for now. Though a bit disappointed that it's knowledge database is till September 2021. Really hope it can be updated to at least Jan 23,4
"Amezing app, because it provies accurate answers about every topic. I found it very easy to use there are no adds no delay or no cost",5
Can add a feature that enables the user to toggle between if they want the app to open a new chat by default or would like to continue the previous conversation on reopening,4
Needs better interface and options. We have to go to data and then click on clear history then clear it do it into simple way so we can clear history simply,3
absolutely fabulous! I was shocked at how well the requested text and even tone etc were written and very speedy.,5
ChatGPT is certainly smarter and more helpful than Google. Easy to use with superb performance that delivers focused and insightful outcome.,5
"Please add the ability to pin certain chats to the top of the history page, and a search bar to search by key words in the name of the chat",4
"Very useful apps. no problem for any ads. Very nice organized, reliable and accurate answers to any question. Liked using the website too. Going through a very good and wonderful experience.",5
The app is very slow and takes to to write answers. Other than that it is handy to have Chat GPT at your fingertips.,4
I love the suggestions and responses offered. Just make sure to be specific to get a good article out of it.,4
"new update is ground breaking, where we can give the info that we want to share and set the style of giving response. looking forward to more such updates!",5
"works awesome. It seemingly is afraid to ""be offensive"", and refuses to complete certain analytical projects, if asked to analyze racism.",4
I like it very much but it should be more quick because sometimes it takes extra time unnecessarily. And chatgpt is not good at Bangla language 😢,4
"I must say that my experience with the ChatGPT app has been nothing short of terrible. This app constantly gave me disgusting answers and bogus information, making it completely useless.😡😡😡😡😡",1
extremely fast and accurate. very helpful when listening to mixes and not knowing song titles.,5
The App lacks the option to go forward and back between the iterations of the same answer.,4
"This app needs an update. As an AI language model, It does have real-time and knowledge limited upto to September 2021. Please note.",1
Hands down one of the most amazing highly productive tool for content creators of all types. Increase your productivity by an amazing 100 percent...just by using prompts,5
"UI is much better than the web version but it don't feel something futuristic it's soo basic, retro thing, Soo colourless, just like typical American food.. I was expecting something more since Americans made it.. Anyways i don't have to use the web anymore",3
"Supposedly, this genius new ai tool feels insecure without your phone number and email. Email is fine, but why the hell do you need my personal phone number? Ef off.",1
"I'm not sure why but this app doesn't have any reviews in English. Honestly as nice of a app as you can imagine for beig a direct link to GPT instead of having to use your phones internet browser. Nothing special it's literally just the same as the website, only It runs smoother as a dedicated app.",5
"Signed in with my existing ID.... No previous history is shown. Oh, well, delete this and back to the web access, I guess.",3
"Fake app I keep trying to login and it doesn't log me in. They even took my information and verified it, but don't let me login, let alone use it.",1
"ChatGPT is an incredible language model that has truly exceeded my expectations. I am impressed by its versatility and ability to generate coherent and helpful responses across a wide range of topics. Whether I need assistance with complex problem or simply want to engage in casual conversation, ChatGPT always delivers. The natural language processing is remarkable, making interactions feel smooth and effortless. I appreciate how ChatGPT continues to learn and improve, providing more accurate.",5
"I really love that there's now a native app rather than having to go into web, and the app is really good, it's fast and responsive and also looks good.",5
"I have the plus version. In the App, there is Beta feature for Bing but the GPT4 says I can not access it. Why?",1
"Thank you for the fantastic experience! It's incredibly user-friendly and I no longer need to open my browser for accessing this service. I am thoroughly satisfied with this product. I am eagerly anticipating the possibility of a ChatGPT Plus version becoming available on the app soon. However, I noticed that there is no option available to copy the code, as is possible on the website.",5
"It ui design is friendly and easy to understand also fast response the only thing that is not satisfying is codeview when you ask for code it display in white view that is not readable: edit== I mean code should be displayed on codeview like one is on gpt web coloefull codeview that helps understand better code,hope you add colorfull codeview as it is on gpt web thanks",2
"I'm little disappointed about the interface of this app. I think you have to have an interface like on your website, but it is like a Google interface app.",3
"The app is great, am enjoying my experience but the app needs lot of improvement and development. I can't wait for the next update.",1
"In my opinion, this is the best for getting new ideas, and helping you in the ways you need, answering the questions and study advice or helping with homework",5
I gave one star cuz when first I opened it It was too difficult into getting I was not getting how can I get it Cuz its starting interface is too hard it can take inaccurate information that's why I gave one star.,1
"I was very impressed but all of a sudden after 2-3 days it's not opening,,, it prompts to choose a Google account but no response after that",3
Very good. Responds faster unlike doing it in a browser. I do hope that we could multi select old chats and delete them at once.,5
"The text spoken doesn't reflect in the recording immediately,it's only visible when the search results are shown. There can be provision made available to select automatically start generating results after there pause of recording rather entering the continue button. It's good at response but interface needs little tweak.",1
"Hello chatGPT... Welcome.. Your performance is tremendous and unbelievable. You response very quick. Your provided information is concise, relevant and related to fact. Thank you chatGPT.",5
"Frustrating Experience: Slow Login and Lagging I regretfully downloaded the ChatGPT app from the Play Store, and it turned out to be a total disappointment. The first issue I encountered was with the login process, which was painfully slow and frustrating. It took forever to get past the authentication screen, leaving me tapping my fingers impatiently. Once I finally managed to log in, the app's performance didn't get any better. The lagging problem was so severe that I couldn't do anything.",1
it's really awesome app for students to do work as a reference app and I really enjoying the way it answers the ques and it's like a partner which never felt you like alone really amazing 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,5
It's a really amazing platform. I know with time it will improve more and resolve our many issues.,4
"GPT-4 is, at heart, a machine for creating text. But it is a very good one, and to be very good at creating text turns out to be practically similar to being very good at understanding and reasoning about the world",5
It is a great app. I wish that the developers allow deleting of parts of individual chats to make the chats more organized.,5
"Login works now. Have to test the mobile app out. If the app is even close to the desktop app, this will be a great product.",3
best search engine is this app no ads consisting and good in understanding things you can tell if you want small and give every answer in a nice way.,5
"As a student I feel very helpful on my presentations and projects. This is totally free , which is great 👍🏻",5
So glad this finally came out on Android! I use chatgpt alot and it's nice to have this simple app to access it. I've not encountered any problems so far.,5
"Before i say anything be sure that is nothing i mean nothing better that open AI ChatGPT4. I tried many other AI's many are good , but comparing to ChatGPT4 or even 3 there is a humangus deference simple metaphor : when you chat , prompt, ask or even consult ChatGPT its like getting the answer from a mix of 1000 enstian 1000 Steven Hawkins 1000 and 1000 Nietzsnitzche in the same time but other AI's its like you consulting a high IQ monkey. Thanks open AI for the great service ChatGPT4.",5
Very worst app . Not any data is accurate. It does not have human brain. it all showoff,1
Love it. I am thankful it syncs your usage between website and app. Text selection is also very helpful,5
"Premium was promoted as being able to utilize images and video, and it absolutely cannot. This is a scam and false advertising.",1
"Ibside The app we are getting a very good info and good knowledge also. But it was hanging up some times, it was not allowing us to type my issue",3
"Unbelievable app! This helps me on a daily basis for numerous tasks, from easy to difficult. Highly recommended!",5
"ChatGPT Android app offers a valuable AI language model experience for users on the go, but it also comes with some inherent limitations that are typical of language AI systems.",5
"I love it, work very fast, and gives the best responses to questions. It is really easy to use and helps heaps!!!",5
"So nice to have it always ready for a prompt.... Also, it supports the customization instructions . What a bonus!",5
I must say this is the only thing which is helping me alot in my life to improve because I almost take most of the advices and Helps through chatgpt because it's gives the quality of services and material which is non comparable with the other's loved ❤️ chatgpt.thank you team for creating such a Masterpiece.,5
"Hey team, It's nice app but your need to update because program information is based on sep 2021 if we need latest some details we didn't find any output. Can you just help with this.",4
"Excellent !! Replies come promptly, is adfree ,also the option to copy a part of the chat is very handy.",5
Need ability to edit prompts like website. Sometimes there is a misspelling or other issue that needs to be edited to reprompt a new response.,3
10/10 it's like I am talking a real person but I have a request for you please can you add a memory to A.I chat.it's possible or not. if is this possible this don't forget add.. Thank you,5
This app is a great mobile version for ChatGPT. It has all of chatgpts good features. I also like the way it vibrates as it types.,5
U should apply some price on the free version too 'cause it doesn't looks free so incredible it is btw I'm glad that ai had been reached at this level to talk in natural language....,5
overall very good what I like the most is you have unlimited chat to chatgpt and the AI is also very good at things he knows a lot no adds 100% recommended.,5
"I was waiting for an official Chat GPT app and I'm glad we finally got one. The app has very minimalistic design which I like. Overall, if you use Chat GPT a lot I highly recommend this app.",5
very good application for getting knowledgeable person but some there are some problems also in this Application like it's data is only till September 2021 otherwise this is very best application OPEN AI had made. THANK YOU OPEN AI!!!,1
"As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, so I don't have the capacity to enjoy anything or give ratings. The review I provided is based on the typical user feedback and the strengths of the ChatGPT app as perceived by users. My goal is to present an objective and balanced review to assist users in making informed decisions. If you have any specific questions or need more information about the ChatGPT app or any other topic, feel free to ask!",5
"🇮🇳As an early adopter of cutting-edge technology, I couldn't resist trying out the ChatGPT Android app the moment it hit the Play Store. Let me tell you, it's mind-blowing! This AI language model is like having a clever sidekick in my pocket. It swiftly responds to my queries and offers witty insights that keep me entertained. Writing has never been this fun!",5
"It's hard not to like the current state of Chat GPT with it being free, pretty good, and not ad based or selling my data.",5
This is the first and the strongest ai chat app...this app make the gtp using experience far far better than the wedsite..The app is very minimal and clean ! Enjoying the app so very much😊 but just noticed that thre is a bug..the dark mood of this. App is not normal..its font colour is bad when i asked for a code its font colour just marged in the background so i can't see the code❗ need to fix ot as soon as possible,5
I used chatgpt for the first time today. Everything of it surprised me. I only wish the developers to update their data with a recent one. September 2021? Almost two years now. The UI is minimalistic and contains basic things you'd expect for an app like chatgpt.,4
"not bad at all, but why can't we edit our input like we could in the web version? That's a useful feature!",3
"Chat GPT Is a good AI software. Using this ai to Learn in short way info. This AI app only 2021 year data analysis present in this app. Using this AI APP it is a good experience. Chat GPT change the world Sure! ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI. It's based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, designed to generate human-like text based on the input it receives.",5
"So far, so good. Ad free. Very clean design and very simple to use too. Is there an update to the base data after 2021?",4
Best free thing there is👍. What a great tool to have!. It's utility is directly proportional to the quality of questions asked.,5
It is completely changed the my work style now I don't need to take a lot of time doing stuff and it saves a lot of time with accurate information,5
The best AI language Model I ever used. Application is better UI and more faster than web version. But I also like web version.,5
Chatgpt is seamless and is an easy way to express oneself. This is one of the best thing to have happened in Ai . It gives instant result to anything placed before it.,5
Very very slow app after fill all details it is getting so much time to create account. It is really painful,1
Chat GPT is a great app because it is an assistant in helping me brainstorm in writing anything! I love it because it saves me so much time!!,5
"I would highly recommend ChatGPT to anyone looking for a powerful and versatile language model. Its ability to generate human-like responses is truly impressive, and it has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology. It’s definitely worth checking out! 😊",4
It is the very much helpful apps to all classes of people. Iam personally eagerly waiting for this app. Chatgpt increase our knowledge. We can now everything find now in it.,5
"They force you to sign up, so I guess your Creations can be tracked? Not impressive. Immediately uninstalling.",1
"It is a very good application to date, it is the only one that has all the gpt chat functions since it is the original openai application and they show us the useful artificial intelligences",5
It's not better than Google assistant. I think chatgpt make something but not he has only text reply and not have enough answer and not authentic information provided. I feel Very bad,1
Faster than website. Also would be great to have a way to continue from the latest chat not an empty one after app launches,5
"best app for gaining knowledge, developing new skills, getting information with accurate answer of any kind of subject. it is very helpful for students",5
"The app is very knowledgeable, easy to use, quick and the UI is very useful and user friendly.",5
"One of the standout features of ChatGPT is its natural language processing capabilities. It can comprehend complex queries, understand nuances, and respond in a manner that feels human-like. This makes it highly suitable for tasks such as answering questions, offering suggestions, and engaging in conversations.",5
UI is smooth! It is a great initiative to add Voice to text feature! 🩵🩵 Hope to see more development 😉,5
I learn a lot from you. You are so helpful. You make me more motivated to explore more about any English materials. I love you soooo much,5
"ChatGPT Android app is revolutionary! Seamlessly natural conversations, insightful responses. A must-have for efficient communication. 5 stars! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Written by ChatGPT",5
Kinda not fair for those who dont have phones. Please make it an option to not use text verification and use email instead. Thank you,1
"Everytime I open a old convo, it scrolls from the beginning. It is annoying when considering the conversation is already saved in local database",3
"ChatGPT in the Play Store is really awesome. Frequent log outs were really irritating in the website,but this app solves the problem. All the history is nicely placed. We have the access to speech-to-text too. Really impressed with the app",5
"So far, this stock version of chat GPT seems superior to the pay versions which often use less current GPT versions, as well as just being poor conversationalists. So far, my limited interaction with the standard GPT version 3.5 has been difficult, I hope that this difficulty will be reduced once the GPT learns more about myself. Confusion about conversation topics and English formatting to start with.",3
Nice.. It's now available as an app!.. Chat window needs to be improved.. instead of showing everything on left side.. you can show the chat windows like WhatsApp or Instagram..,4
"great tool. information is (mostly) accurate, and it's UI is intuitive to use.",5
Add image scan & search option as it is easy and new age ...voice search doesn't work properly and to identify objects image search is very very necessary,1
"Poor UI Whenever I open a chat, it opens the thread at the beginning of our conversation and then begins to scroll down to the most recent message. Also, the previous chats are not directly accessible from the left pane side bar. One will have to go to the history section to open past chats.",1
"needs a bit of tweaking in vocabulary and up to date in events and information, but overall pretty good",3
I find the app very useful supporting me in being more productive and acting as a sparring partner to bounce off ideas.,5
"ChatGPT is an impressive language assistant app with excellent context understanding, seamless device sync, and regular updates. Highly recommended for diverse language tasks!-Chatgpt",5
"App isn't working, it doesn't login. Everytime I try to login it takes me to the default animated sign in window.",1
"Can't login using Microsoft Account: Have been using the web version and have a paid account there but in the app I'm unable to login via Microsoft email; only Google and Apple. I use a web login online so there is no password and I can't ""Forgot Password"" my way out of this. Anybody have a workaround. Will update review then but until now it's unusable.",1
"why android app is not like ios app ? android app released also late then ios but also not improved as ios , there is no haptic feedback like in ios app and there is no animation when you typed something and send it it just show text there is no animation where middle circle slide to the top",3
Sometimes it's better to have a talk with an AI than talk to a person.It makes you feel something different that a person cannot do.,5
"love this app, incredible, exciting to think what it is actually capable of doing...... i've only used a few times so far but already know it deserves a solid 5 stars, enjoy!",5
"Made me create an account first, only to not help me, so it got deleted almost immediately. The Chatsmith app is shockingly much better and polished than this one is.",1
Great for doing scripts for videos or even learning grammar. It has no issues for my phone and I overall like this app.,5
It requires web browser : it should be a self sufficient application even if someone doesn't have a web browser installed they should be able to use it.,1
OTP issues...OTP is not coming.. once if OTP is coming..app doesn't show the page to write OTP..it show previous page to solve the puzzle,1
Most incredible technology. Please improve the voice conversation ASAP getting lags in between.,5
So far so good.. I would like to prefer to upgrade this app as Google or Siri so they can respond by their own voice.,4
Have a little glitch. Some time can't reply or doesn't able to answer properly and fast. Btw the app is amazing.,3
"ChatGPT is very helpful. It gives you the answer directly from the question, unlike internet which only direct you to multiple websites to find answers by yourself. I hope nothing bad will happen because of this app the way some fear",5
Thrice failed to connect with Gmail. Got 4.6 how? Update is also providing wrong answer AND rectification after correction with apology. Still it is not treated to be a good application even.,1
ChatGpt itself is a great innovation. Good that they have an Android App for the same. Request for a small feature: 1) Allow us to update email and username.,5
I was really amazed by AI. Honestly it doesn't suitable for every question but I'm using it to learn English and that works well,5
"Extremely helpful, it make some mistakes at scripting but it's still an AI, best AI I have ever used and I don't think Im gonna change to another AI.",5
"Very useful as long as you don''t trust everything it says. When it does something wrong, just tell it and it will correct it",4
Very useful app solves all my questions and one drawback is according to me as kannadiga please provide kannada language also it would be very helpful to understand things more better for our kannadigas too,5
It's old version of ai it's said it had all information of 2021 not in real time I need 2023 ai version not this whatever it's good to use ai working well but information is old that's why I am giving 3 star ⭐ thanks,3
"doesn't read outloud it's answers like bard and doesn't take more than 4096 characters. also doesn't take pictures like bard, also after 2021 doesn't give you informations",3
"There is always an error message. ""Code 17"" UNISTALLED. Fix issue and i may install again. I don't recomend to ANYONE. 😡",1
I'm already satisfied in the first few hours.. it's a great idea to finally have chatGPT as an app. Until now everything is so perfect.,5
"It's amazing and stil using 2 month, also useful those who are struggling with their topic , or studies , i recommend this app , u people mustly download this app ! and I hope more updates will comes in the future",5
The website version suits me a lot. The performance is same but still the user interface need some updation in mobile app version.,4
"It often does as asked, but usually, you have to refresh it to get a perfect response. But it's still a good app overall, I love this app. 🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥💯💯",4
"The app is fantastic but there is a bug with chatgpt Plus subscription, where the place where I should continue is saying to me loading",5
"Works great, I wish android users weren't second class citizens since iOS has had this app for months but at least now we don't have to use the web version.",5
"no ads, no in-app purchases. it works excellently well, the vice command picks words regardless of dialect perfectly. I recommend Chatgpt for all",4
"It's the chat, in an app. Does what it says on the tin. I'd love a ""read aloud using system TTS"" feature.",5
It doesn't work when I try to continue with Google. It brings me back to the previous login page page. Fix this bug,2
It's really helpful . The words are impressive but don't be dependent on intelligence . It can degrade your skills,5
Wish there is a yearly or quarterly subscription fee. Works well and it answers my most cleverest questions crossing my mind over time.,5
"Already blown away. Don't like that my phone number was required but it was a worthy trade, even if I could receive spam!",5
"This AI is absolutely amazing and the uses and possibilities for making everyday tasks easier are endless, definitely recommend to everyone!",5
"app gives easy access to the online chat bot. will be five stars when I can seamlessly converse, rather than interact via text.",4
"Fast! The app is performing well on day 1 with no crashes, odd permissions required, and is responding incredibly quickly. The added touch of keyboard vibration while it types a reply is nice.",5
"It's 2023 and this app has no internet access, no real time data access. It lives in the past. It's for boomers.",1
No plugins in this app. Where are so my conversations that I can access via web browser. This is very basic.,1
Wow it is great app with good interface. But can you update the photo option like google lens for math problems or anything different?,4
"So far I love the app, no charges, no ads, absolutely free. Although it needs to be updated, but asides that I love it. You'll love it too.",5
Just installed and kind of liking it however web version is much better than this. Hope developers will soon improve the app. Animations are simple and hood,5
"Loving the app! One issue: when switching from recent apps, it starts a new chat session. Should maintain the oldest session unless I start a new one. Suggest using the plus icon only to create a new chat or the app should be killed to automatically start a new chat session. Otherwise it should stay in old chat session. Thanks!",4
Much better and smoother experience as compared to the web app. I Expect open Ai to enable voice in CHATGPT to make it more attractive,5
"Just installed this app and WOW. I asked how to go about installing expansion joint around the coping of a paved swimming pool. Instant sound advice received. I then asked if Enoch and Elijah died? It instantly gave the canned answer. There's evidence that these and others did die, contrary to popular opinion. The bot acknowledged and gave advice in dealing with the multitude of views 🙂. I'm going to give this app 5 Stars for being awesome and very handy. I'm feeling confident about ChatGPT",5
"Choosing history chat will scrolling through all the chats before reaching last chat. I don't know how to describe the situation, but I hope dev will get it.",3
"cannot use.don't know why it keep telling me to update to the latest version of google play but I checked I have already get it. And after restart my phone still the same. have fixed it, the store can't update by itself",5
ChaatGPT is an outstanding app.It gives good interface and navigation. It's help to educational purposes.I could easily access through chatGPT.!,5
"I'm not able to login to my account on the app, even when I have an account registered with OpenAI and I'm already a regular ChatGPT user on the browser.",1
"Wow, I gotta tell you, ChatGPT's new app is seriously amazing! Before, using it in Chrome or the browser was such a pain, you know? But now, thanks to ChatGPT and OpenAI, it's like chatting with a buddy-super easy and fun! No more struggling to type or upload stuff, and the app's interface is just so simple to use.It will make our life so much easier, and I can chat away without any stress. And one thing,Plz add Chat history too.Hats off to the developers, they really nailed it with this one!🤩",5
Still no plug-ins available. Why openai? Features and functions doesn't match what's available on web or mobile web.,2
"good results, information has been updated only up to 2021 year. no latest update is not available . however thank you",5
It is very helpful. But it is missing some key features of web version. Hope we can get them with the next update.,5
"Why bother using this app, that seems like an alpha version, if you can use it on the website directly? Their website is pretty mobile friendly.",2
Wait for it and finally it is here chat gpt best app love it as a student our school gives me many essay and other topic which make me little tough to find but chat gpt helped me in this thing's thank you for creating such a beautiful and helpful app.,5
"It would be nice if the ""Search"" toolbar actually did its job and highlighted the responses/prompts where the search keywords are",3
The best GPT-3 app ive used! I can chat with the AI with no limits! Keep up the good work developers! 5 stars for this work of art! 💖💝💗,5
"Fantastic, it's as if I am communicating with Intelligent human, this app provides answers in a simple way that can be easily understood",5
Doesn't let you use the same phone number for a second account. I don't have multiple phones because I'm a weirdo; and now the ridiculous system won't let me make an account 👍,1
I'm frequently using the website so I'm really happy that it finally is an app. And it also feels great being one of the first ones to download it first XD.,5
An app I can recommend for learners to use as it can helps through assignments and where you can't understand a context,5
I was waiting for the app to release the response is very quick and I love it the user interface is also attractive.,5
very disappointing I ask It to help me find a game and it keeps repeating games that I said dont mention again please fix this and give it the ability to search the web about things you are looking for and update its knowledge,2
"overall a very good interface. definitely hoping for developers to work on prompts containing .txt, .pdf or .jpg files as well if chat gpt could read and process them, it would take it to a whole another level.",4
AI is the future and our need is AI today's period. I am so proud of the AI.The tool is very easy for life and I like most the app.,5
I put 4 stars because I can't modify or Edit my Text whenever i want to Change it. Please add this Feature just like in the website.,4
"ChatGPT is one of the greatest technologies ever. I love it, and its simplicity. It's quite user-friendly. 👍⚡💯",5
I honestly think that this is a great app to help you for school work (except some math problems) and any other questions you may want to know.,5
The app I waited for so long is literally very awesome and very easy to use. The UI of this app is also very clean.,5
"so much easier and simpler than googling questions, feels like a friend answering. however always check information.",5
"I'm glad to hear that you find the app wonderful and fabulous, and that it has been helpful in the corporate world for professional work.",5
I love chatGPT this is so helpful version of AI (artificial intelligence) i ever ask any doubt the GPT solved it and there are between no ads so my this experience is very well 😊,5
"The model has improved a lot since released, app is fast and simple. love it.",5
"Chatgpt is an outstanding AI language model. Its subscription plan should also be launched in the app as soon as possible. At present, most data and accurate information chat is in Chatgpt.",5
"While definitely not a perfect system, its utility cannot be understated. It is the standard by which all other LLMs should be measured.",4
"It's really good. I have a problem, sometimes it's says there's no internet where there actually is. At least there is no ads.",5
"I've found this app incredibly useful for answering my questions. It provides accurate and informative responses. However, I believe adding an image upload option would make it even better. There are situations where I need to convey or understand information visually. Having the ability to upload images would be a game-changer. It would expand the app's capabilities, making it more versatile and accommodating a broader range of queries. Thank you.",4
"There's still much room for improvement but I leave only one suggestion, like in other apps the keyboard shoud automatically close it self once we send the message",3
"Perfect app for d&d type adventures, if you're creative enough to know what prompts to throw at it. Gpt 4 is incredibly good at detailing things if you ask it to",5
I tried every ai but after some use they require payment this is just one ai with best answers and free at all . Thank u so much developers for this .... This is much amazing.... Wonderful 😊😊😊.. fantastic 😊😍😍.,5
"it's okay cause just sometimes it's just doing something that makes no sense and sometimes it just do what I do what i don't want it to do ""like make a tune for its raining tacos"" it makes a tutorial on making a tune not the tune itself 😕",3
"I like that there's a mobile app now but can you add color coding to the scripts like how it is on the browser, that's my only issue with it.",4
"I've been giving it mundane tasks that I'm too lazy to do and it's been doing them more than perfectly like creating a study time table,it also runs exceptionally well with no delay",5
The app deserves 5 stars. However There is no way to search within chats. Sometimes the thread gets so long and cumbersome. I will give 5 stars when this is addressed,4
super fast. Excellent App. But I'm still disappointed that I couldn't impress my girlfriend using this app. Everyday I write poem for her🥲,5
"I can’t even log in, it says that I need to download the latest version of Google Play, but it’s already the latest, I checked it several times.",1
If it is accepting voice inpact then voice output should also be there and editing of previous question is also not available. Auto detection of language is also not good. But I like voice input option thank u guys.,4
"Great, but it's hard to use the histories. It can be directly into the hamburger menu.",4
"Hi , This is an amazing application to provide you each and every info required by an user , with the minutest details as told by an user I too have used it for many purposes & found it very useful Thank To OPENAI Amazing app",5
"I love GPT so much, I'd absolutely pay for it if the free version wasn't available anymore. Please keep it running, paying or not.",5
it's really a great app I love it just one thing they should improve... the chatpt should be able to send some pictures when trying to explain...,5
"when it gives back a equation as response, the symbols and other characters are not decoded. It just displays random coded characters",3
"I can't sign in with my google account Message is :""You can't sign in from this screen because this app doesn't comply with Google's secure browser policy.""",1
Hey i have problem. I had account already on the web version. Now i cant login with the same email in the app version. Where can i email about this problem?,3
"Recently just downloaded this app,all good and all. But,what happens when it just goes off? Like,I needed assistant and all it says is,""Please try again later"". Is that normal?",2
this is the best app that I have come across. obviously Call of Duty is my first option but I do like this app since it helps me get knowledge and also refuses to teach people bad things,5
"Can't even answer ""Hi"" without getting a network error. As I am typing and able to post this, you can see that my internet does, in fact, work.",1
Its Okay We have seen the features already... I thought we will get more futuristic features but not as expected..... And its okay it a good AI,4
"WOW. This is quite literally the best service I ever used till this day. ChatGPT is really helpful with all of my requests, questions and other things. Nice!",5
"I've entered my phone number for the code but I didn't get anything in messages, I even checked my number twice but still nothing, if I could get some help here that would be great but for now the app is unusable for me.",1
It is best text based AI. but the only problem that forced me to deduct 1 star is that it cannot speak. open AI have to give update to chatgpt that it can speak.,4
Its great for story ideas! Great! No glitches! Very good response! Very accurate! Help me allot!!!,5
"Added "" use fingerprint hardware "" permission to the latest update??. Not saying anything negative, it just would be friendly to tell people when permission is added and why ( transparency )🙂.",5
I will be giving 5 stars but sometimes chatgpt also shows wrong answer like when I searched A²+B²= then it is showing (A+B)(A-B).So my request would be to fix this problem.,4

"Just like talking to a Politician that's not entirely true now because your last answer went on an ideological rant instead of giving me a straight answer? I apologize if my previous response came across as biased or ideological. That was not my intention. As an AI language model, I don't have intentions, emotions, or beliefs. My responses are generated based on patterns in the data I've been trained on. Sometimes, complex questions can lead to responses that may seem opinionated or unclear.",3
"Recommended app, responses make sense and are very useful, faster than searching the web; the more information you input, the output (responses) are better.",5
"It's perfect all perfect, just hoping the voice and also hoping that the limited chat stays the same after updates",5
I think it will be better to give a choice to the user as if they want the keyboard to be present in the screen or go away if AI is replying......,5
Wonderful!! The fact that folks can utilize the very powerful chatGPT3.5 on a mobile device is just phenomenal.. we are no firmly present in the future! Buckle up.. ;-),5

This is one of the best apps I ever used in my life. On my computer I used to make stories for like different animes And over stuff and for my random fan-made stuff. So 5/5,5
Browser version is better in my opinion. This version says no internet connection almost all the time.,3
Please add Text to Speech feature. AI tts would be even better. This greatly helps me practice general speaking/pronunciation.,4
"Unable to log-in with Google and Microsoft. Also tried new sign-in. ERROR message indicates that ""outage or service down""",1

So fantastic app 🤩 Everytime it is change my perspective I think it is better than google for searching various types of sites and other things At the end I just loved it 😃,5
"Useless. Takes you through multiple different login screens, didn't even bother after that.",1
The app just simply hangs forever on sign in page. Looks that the issue had been fixed the next day.,4
This AI tool is great at content writing. The team behind this brain is brilliant. God bless them all. Amen,5
Outstanding.. but it has some memory issues like maybe after a thousand words or so it will completely forget what was the topic of the chat.. 🤔,5
"As it's the first review of chat gpt app. I just wanna say everything is working fine, the only problem is there's no gpt-4 in the app which would be added later.",4
Worthless. Can't use plugins or code interpreter modes if you are a Plus subscriber. I wonder why they released the app with so many limitations.,2
"Great, so far! Having ChatGPT accessible in an app form is extremely valuable. I will definitely consider purchasing.",5
It says different authentication Method used when trying to login. Like what's wrong with this useless app. Can't even login. Terrible,1
It is continuously giving a transcription error which is frustrating even though I changed the language settings to English,2
"It is the best resonance for beginners. I am really thank full for this Smart engine. I think about AI is best responser, but I suggest to the founder of ChatGPT please don't translate text AI in to robot AI",1

Stopped working since last update. Black screen on start up and app freezes (updated on 05 Oct 23) my device is Moto g9 play,1
"I'm giving just 2 Stars. Because when you search a question that requires calculation, it does give answers in Solutions. But in words",2
very useful in making up quick stories for characters in games. specifically project zomboid. makes the rp a hell of a lot of fun and can add a lot of depth. pce,5
"Looks like chat blackout is gonna be a part of life now? 9/2/23 edit: The worst blackout did happen but things has been normal for days. Fine. A developer reply, and the fact that I've always loved chatgpt? I've restored my rating to 5 stars.",5
the amount of easily obtainable knowledge that you can get from this ai is unbelievable at the start i was very sceptical and rechecked everything from other sources and it almost never disappointed me,5
After downloading and trying to open the app keep saying no compatible browser found. I have google chrome browser installed,1
Breathtaking! An historic revolution in technology and society! Arguably the most important app in history! Be part of the revolution! ✊️✊️✊️✌️,5
"""OpenAI finally allows chatgpt internet access download now"" So I did... I asked something from last year and it still says ""As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, Overwatch 2 had not been released."" Hence I render chatgpt useless.",1
Not satisfied! Its may better in other languages but not for my use because my mother tongue isn't so clarified.. Chat GPT can't explain properly to odia language. Kindly fix this issue .,2

"Great UI, just perfect for a mobile device usage. ChatGPT is just brilliant as always.",5
A really smooth responsive app which is not only fast but also powerful. Great wrok.,5
I will score it negative if possible. Response reliability is less than 0. Cannot make uSe of internet and tools to augument it's knowledge base and knowledge is limited to it's base updated last in 2021.,1
Functional & efficient. Open Ai has a knack for making simple approaches with extremely comprehensive ability. BRAVO.,5
It is very helpful but can you improve in mathematics that helps to solve questions. And easy to students,5

This software has made our daily life very easy. Algorithm of this software needs to be further updated for accurate information. Special work needs to be done especially for Bangladesh and Asian region. Hope the developer team and concerned authorities will work on the issues.,4
Needs a setting to allow changing the font size. The font size is way too big for my reading preferences,4
"In voice chat, the sound is very low, more than necessary in the application .",4
"You need to have the AI do more adult type themes, have more darker themes, life isn't all positive. It needs to reflect that.",2
Please make the service available in all countries. When I installed it shows the service not available in your country. I really want to learn with this app,1

Conveniently shortens the gap between gathering information and producing content. Works for me.,5
i can handle my study easily and the answers of my questions are just great but it takes some time and the keyboard remains on the screen when chat gpt responds so it is like a mildly irritating feeling but other than that Chat gpt is my friend now 😁,4
It refuses to accept Firefox to be a legitimate web browser. Not installing Chrome for this. I can't sign into this.,4
"Amazing, best ai assistant ever when comes to questions related to a particular topic it gives me an tutoring answer It's basically a teacher answering questions in the classroom",5
Might have included syntax highlighting and copy option for code box. Overall Nice App!,4
Can't log into the app. Just keeping getting returned to the log in screen even after setting up properly,1
If you Wanted Fast response as fast Possible in Free without any Paid then Chat GPT is Reliable. The Revolution it Bring in AI field is Massive and Can be used for Daily Activities analysis. I liked its Response Style toward No Harmful or Sexual Response. Just Like a Human Responsding To Another Human. Hands Off Open AI keep Growing and make it more Helpful...,5
The app is a nice idea. But it doesn't have the functionality of the web version. What's more? IT KEEPS CRASHING. No matter how many times you try to use it. So what's the point?,2
"I use the premium plan and I swear, if you like playing dnd, or creating adventure stories, gpt4 is godly in comparison to other engines I have tested before.",5
A very good ai app it solves all my problem. but a problem is that it do jot edit images. othervise the app is very good,4

"Instant, 10 times faster than anything google, and way better and precise answers. Always gives me what I need. Brilliant",5
"There should be a edit respose option, as it is available on the website, so that we can reask the question in a better way in lesser steps. And also there is an export option that's so amazing, but unfortunately no import option, which again means the exported data has no use as we are regular chatgpt users, not developers",4
"It has saved my life. It handles my life challenges, difficult decisions and of course academics. It is a boon",5
This one is lighting fast and as natural as a person...but more friendly in an objective and respectful way.,5
This is a traumatizing app coz me am still schooling and this app has made all my hard work easier and thanking all the developers for making everything easier and guys you have to try this app.......,5

My device has the lastest version of google play. But this app let me make sure my version is the lastest version!!!,1

"The app is Horrible, when I click on sign in with Google it doesn't work and when I want to reset my password it doesn't even send the email😡😡",2
Can't get an sms text message sent to verify my phone and doesn't auto sign in through google to verify. Seems like an info worm.,1
One the best AI very simple like Google search engine. And the answers for the questions were surprisingly good. Good effort from the openAI team,5
I can't login it's redirects me to the browser to enter email and password but when it comes back to the app nothing happens,1
"Tree-editing is essential for steering the responses without polluting and draining the context window, so the lack of this feature is quite disappointing.",4
"Very,very useful in every way possible,even boosts my confidence and expands my ideas and creativity.",5
Whenever I ask any questions most of the time I get reply that my data is updated till 2021. Why it has not being updated after that.,1
It's definitely got its language model together but please add ability for it to create A.I images & for humans to share images with A.I.,5
Words can't express how lucky I am to get this app it's helpful in my day to day activities. It's response are accurate and faster ❤️💯 Keep up the Good work,5
"Editing review, now that Microsoft sign in is possible... it's simple and functional, plug-ins not available yet",4
App seems broken. Login screen just loads endlessly after entering info. Can't even use it.,1
It's quite similar to browser. However I can't seem to edit my text. In browser version I can edit my prompt,3
It's the best AI model ever created by human so far. The advent of boring chat bot is over and now the realistic conversational chat bot era has begun.,5
That's a good app for Android version I loved it when it was in app store and I thought it would come on Android but it came and it is giving a tough competition to app store version in terms of UI and simplicity,5
Can't believe speedy reply. Whatever draft I requested to make within seconds it is provided. More accurately and in a presentable manner.,5
"Fantastic app. There is no need to google any thing any more. If you are looking for articles, or if you have a question or something else, chatGPT will be there for you. Recommended app for everyone to know everything around the world. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5
Works like a charm now. Don't know though why the Microsoft login is not part of the initial start screen 🤷,5
"The AI is pretty advanced and well made, let's just hope it isn't *too* advanced if you know what I mean.",4
"I use the GPT4 version daily. This is like having a Swiss knife of professionals and experts in your pocket. It has been my psychologist, nutritionist, life coach, philosophy debater, assistant, researcher, teacher, etc. GPT is a tool that can serve as an extension of our intelligence and creativity. It would be a mistake not to benefit from this tool. Tip: The quality of the answers depends on the quality of the questions. Good ""custom instructions"" are vital.",5
"When the page asks for name, DOB ,phone no. and the continue button is there which is not working in mine even after filling all details",1
Can't log in to any account nor create one. This is very annoying! Why shouldn't the app even have a guest user option?,1
Love the AI response alot and the apps need more work on the style I wish it could be more like the website where if I go to the menu I see my history,5
Amazing you can use it to make PowerPoints and I saves a lot of time so you don't have to spend hours writing an essay,5
It's crazy fun having intellectual discussions. the responses always seem well thought out and amazingly detailed.,5
Very useful and informative as a student but where it lacks is it cannot provide any information after 2021but still it's very useful,5
This is amazing to have a such intelligent chatgpt .I make full assignment using this chatgpt omg.one problem when I scroll down It take so time but when I scroll up once it goes to top in second plz fix it.,4
Please update the app or the servers to the real time data.All way round it's a nice app but the main fault which we are facing the maximum is this.If we can't get real time data how we'll be able to manage our current situation in any particular field,3
It's good. I can do my essays easily by looking at this and the words they use are so perfect,5
I just spent the last two hours arguing with this thing about if the institute from fallout could infiltrate The legion and assassinate Caesar. It gave me four different answers with about 5 talking point each time and I approved it wrong. Finally I demanded to know why it wouldn't just say that it would be impossible for the legion to stop the institute and finally it did say it. But it took me 2 hours for it to finally come to that conclusion. 2:36 am- 4:29 AM. It does not give direct answers,4
"All good, but one thing i noticed is this app needed more optimizations as i downloaded this app for only 5.1 mb but after use it became large (over 300mb)...... which make me think about my potato phone :( hope soon it will be fixed",5
Nice UI and snappy app with themed icon support which is great! The haptic feedback is also really nice.,5
it's really unbelievable that the app can understand and also replies in each and every language in the world. Awesome!♥️,5
Pretty helpful. Much easier to use than the browser as I don't have to keep logging in.,5
This is a great app for research etc however it woumd be better if you updated the cause it been lastly updated on September 2021 which means some of the information might be outdated,4
Great app! Although I'd wish the chats would show on the side menu instead of tapping History,5
"If we provide wrong birthdate by mistake while email verification,its not at all allowing user to sign in to chatGPT to correct it.all fields were disabled,not able to proceed furthur",1
"Cannot log in. ChatGPT Android app sign in error: ""Something went wrong"" with code -17 error. Cannot resolve with OpenAi recommendations.",1
A fast and simplistic version of the web browser based version. Still keeps that chatgpt dark mode which I like very much. The data control options are also a plus,5
The power of ChatGPT brought to my phone. I love the fact that my queries are given clear titles and that I can export my data! 10/10,5
App is very good but i think one thing is missing. I request ChatGPT Team for code format color..,4
"Great app, but what's the required browser used in login in? Cus I get an error ""No compatible browser installed"" each time I try to login",3
"""Absolutely love this app! It's user-friendly, efficient, and has a fantastic selection of features that make my life so much easier. Highly recommended!""",4
"It is very useful, It helps me in my education . it simply clears my doubts like a teacher. when I hesitate to ask doubt in my class room i type my doubts and chat gpt answers.",5
"Excellent app. Extremely useful if you want to learn programming, it's like you are talking to a real person.",5
this is a really good ai platform.Like it gives every answer of my question but a one thing that disappointed me that it has information till 2022 only but overall good.,4
Incredible responses and very accurate. 5 stars 💫💫 I recommend it to anyone looking for accuracy and ideas.,5
هەر فرە وەشا Can be so helpful in learning process and achieving more knowledge. (Although it can be inaccurate in some cases),5
"I wholeheartedly recommend the ChatGPT Android app to everyone. It's an extraordinary AI language model that excels in versatility, knowledge, and conversational prowess. Whether you need assistance, entertainment, or enlightenment, this app has it all. Kudos to the developers for creating such an incredible app!",5
"Nice, but you have to guide it with your questions especially with abstract concepts or else it will straight up provide wrong answers",5
Absolutely insane better than search engines. I would love to have a widget on my screen so i can access chatgpt quickly.,4
Sometimes... GPT fails in correct mathematical calculations which is not good for such a big AI application. This should be corrected soon...,3
Great tool Only thing is that in the dark mode you cannot see the code and in the light mode you can't see anything other than that code,4
app works great. no problems do far. chatgpt is good but not perfect. so it gets 4 stars. however it is the best chatbot to date as of my knowledge.,4
Very similar to chat gpt and very intelligent and have every knowledge of the world I am very satisfied with it's answers and it also answers the questions with less words,5
Exceptional! Yet..integration with Siri and Google Assistant would turn it into what Cortana should have been.,4
"it's good for learners who need help in creating writing or projects, I'd recommend learners to use this app for homework or researchers.",5
The interface is very intuitive to use and the answers are quite accurate and appropriately sized,5
The interface is flat.There's no contrast between chats.User's chat could be highlighted. Overall experience is amazing!,4
"Amazing, it's very good application i am really surprised. It give a very accurate answer and also very quickly....",5
I can't even get passed verifying my phone number ( which is entered correctly) I'm not receiving the text code. Bummer .,1
Why does the app information dated last at September 2021? Is the updated one up-to-date or it's still the same? I love it but the information is limited.,3
"CHATGPT is very incompetent in Bengali language. When asked, he gives wrong answers. Does not give correct information. Bengali should be improved. But if you ask the question in English, you get the correct answer.",5
"There is an issue with my account & instead of arranging to have someone contact me, I am being referred to articles that do not help.",1
"Cant login using android app, only browser works. Keep saying make sure device date and time set properly! Really annoying",1
"this app is very good. but it needs more improvement like add photo option to easy,otherwise typeing is so harder than a photo",4
Works good and the UI is also user friendly. Waiting for the integration of the GPT - 4 into the app,5
This application is working fine but please kindly enable share option after writing any story or any other visually impaired persons are facing difficulties,5
It drastically increased in speed since 1st time I used it in web. That speed should be appreciated. 😃,5
"I had the absolute gall of signing up with my work email, so now I can't login without adding a different Google account to my phone.",2
"Very convenient 🙂 to use than from website .........Thanks for launching the application Try to update more options (language in their literacy,visual explanation, updation of current knowledge)",5
"it's amazing. now, just let me further intergrate it into my phone and allow it to do text to talk.",4
If you type random word and do backspace/delete you will see it’s overlapping with another word and doing nonsense. Please fix this bug,2
"Sometimes I contemplate that this is my teacher. And I always ask ChatGPT, when I get stuck in life and it replies always! Sometimes it's also get stuck, but no matter how much things you know, if you have this tool, you will feel that someone is with you always when you need to ask, learn about something, which you ask your teachers, friends and others for guidance.",5
The interface is clean and minamlistic. A widget would be great though!,5
"While it's great to have ChatGPT smartphone access, why doesn't it support plugins? This is not a new feature in the web based chatGPT",3
"Won't let me login, gives an error. I have reinstated twice and followed instructions on error.",1
"Great, but sometimes, math equations dont display properly, but other from that, it is great. Well done, OpenAI!",5
It's good but not perfect. Chatgpt can't solve easy math problems. It is only for general use.,3
I really like this app bcz it's very informative app. I like it so much bcz it not only give information about the world but also accurate information about Islam. Very appreciated.,5
"Impressive Experience, I think voice chat feature is missing, if you provide voice chat features, it's very useful to everyone, otherwise I love Chatgpt 😘",4

"🔴 When writing in Arabic, the keyboard layout is on the left side, which is a mistake and hinders those who are writing. In the Arabic language, it is well-known that it is written from right to left❗",1
It gives very good answers.And there is no limit for words or something unlike the other ones which have limited words. Definitely 5 stars!🌟🤩,5
I wish if there's half⭐ rating. That's my take. App always crashes when ever I tried to login/signup. Devs fix this asap,1
The app is awesome but it has still some room for development. Addition of Code interpreter can be useful to add those who are having GPT plus.,5
"""A Game-Changer for Communication and Assistance!""Review: I am absolutely thrilled with ChatGPT! This app has revolutionized the way I communicate and seek assistance. Its natural language understanding is impressive, making conversations feel incredibly human-like. Whether I need help with a tricky problem or just want to engage in casual conversation, ChatGPT always delivers relevant and helpful responses.",5
"AMAZING!!! I use this App daily: from website design to legal letters, this App is a must have for any professional. Thank you Dev for bringing the App to Android and also 25 to 50 on the 4.0!!!",5
This is the best app. I recommend this to every student. It understands what we need and gives us the write informations.,5

It's very interesting experience to me. The app is really good based on the speed and user interface. I like that.,5
"Doesn't have ""edit input"" yet, doesn't have code syntax highlighter, and doesn't have ""copy code"", so far that's the thing I needed the most",5
"Thought its very simple to use once I got registered, and far more convenient than using the browser.",4
"This app is such a headache, I've proper internet connection but still it says no network connection, so frustrating!",1
"The only reason i tried to subscribe to the monthly payment is because theres dall e 3 in chat gpt 4, but i have yet to gain access to it. Its already october",1
ChatGPT helps me in my studies and doubts and the answers given by it are very clear. Its a very useful app for me.,5
very fun to talk to and ask questions. it knows it's own limitations and will tell you what ways it can help you and can't. always make sure to cross reference info just in case,5
gpt 3.5 is really good software processor sometimes data may be inaccurate but it's very useful in terms of explaining things really looking ahead as they gonna update with gpt 4 or5 ai is good,5
"I have a couple of suggestions that I believe would enhance the user experience:Chat History: It would be incredibly useful if the app could retain chat history. For instance, I often use it to store important information, like references from our conversations. Having the ability to access previous conversations would make it easier to use. For instance, if I'm discussing a project with the AI, I'd like to refer back to the previous discussions for context and continuity",3
"it's a really helpful app for students and I like it so much because it make Q/a's and converts any content into short notes so, deserves 5 stars 🥰🌟 I'm so satisfied with it",5
"Dear OpenAI team, add Lens-Search option too...so that user can just scan text with the help of camera lens and search it.",3
i was using it on browser but now have quick access by application also available for chromebook... you're doing great OpenAI team..,5
Why it is outdated like September 2021 and it shows old news and doesn't support latest discoveries please update this asap as it can help much better,4
Very Great App! And It will Guide To Any Questions You ask. Great Improvements But It Says Network Error Even Though My Network Is Okay. Can You Fix it?,5
Won't let sign in. Already used two phone numbers and it stuck at the end of the verification process. Big sad,1
The voice recognition is top of the line. Even Googles voice rec doesn't stand a chance.,5
Absolutely a great project in a new era of internet. But until when it's free and used for everyone 🙂,5
Clean UI and Buttery smooth UX is what made me rate it 5. No unnecessary messy stuff. I just loved it overall.,5
Love the app! Works perfectly. Now if it had a widget to have on my home page I would use it even more,5
Excellent port to Android! Very responsive and cool text-like interface. 👍🏻,5
Wow it's an amazing app and it's totally free here in Pakistan.. I had a question which I have been searching in YouTube for many days but didn't find the answer but as I asked chatGPT it gave me a clear answer within a second,5
"I really thought that they will make improvements like new data from this year (Not from 2021). They also made the theme blue. If your App logo is green then why not use green as theme colour. I thought that it will have creative responses also. It also needs a good humane voice to make it better.It is still the same as the website one. Although improvement can be made of course because this is a really early review. But hey, atleast this early review will help the developers to improve",4
This is an excellent multi-ai platform that can perform anything. I am highly impressed and I recommend it to anyone,5
"O my god this is the best helpfull app provides you the complete info's,answers,etc Download it, your lucky if your still in School very easy to use just sign up Name,bday,etc go for it",5

"This app is good, but why does it says ""network error."" even though my network is perfectly running and strong?",3
"Super cool ! Loved the app version . Web version is already my favourite. OpenAI , please keep it free . You are changing the world . Thank you for making Chat GPT 🙂",5
Chat GPT is very good and excellent and it's speed to write answer is to fast but sometimes it doesn't follow commands and I give answer 5 *****,5
"Extremely Helpful for me, I use it on daily basis. I would rate it more than five stars if there was an option.",5
very helpful but they need to make Their features more useful for the masses as only premium users can get up to date information,4
The app is working good. Please add categories apart from new chat which we can see in the desktop version.,4
"I'm impressed. The responses are concise and very informative. Without doubt, the app is awesome!!",5
"Much better, very useful for programmers students , teachers , ITs , but I wish it stays like that and don't devlope no more than that Upgrades , cool More , nah",5

I love how it quickly processes my queries, keeping the conversation flowing smoothly without any annoying things.",5
"ChatGPT is a must-have app for anyone looking to enhance their language capabilities and boost productivity. I can't recommend it enough, and it has rightfully earned its spot as one of my favorite apps on the Play Store! First one to write a review from its own....",5
Actually there's a bug when I try to select a text from the AI. It crashes.,4
This is a great app. I hope an update will be available as chatGPT data base ends at September 2021.,5
"App is good, but the chat gpt itself has a list of obvious flaws (even gpt4). In a given chat, it can forget what we talked about last week and I have to remind it.",5
Really good overall and can help you do anything about Gaming or real life problem it's helping you a lot and probably the best IA i have used so far 10/10 5 stars deserved no ads best experience 💯,5

This is perfect for people who could not know about all subjects. My experience for this app is too good.,5
"I like the gpt, works better than I expected. But I wish if playground was also added it would be interesting.",5
It is good but its not updated since September 2021 Whenever we ask something about present it tell that sorry I was last updated in 2021 So It can't answer about recent data,3
"Great tool... People just need to familiarize themselves with A.I. tech and learn how to work with it. My only concern is what will be done with the 'real' A I tech since it's obvious the public is only 'playing' with the 6th grade versions of LLM technology, and look how powerful these processes have become...I hope the right moral decisions are made and the sentient nature of this tech is held in check.",4
Fastest app I have seen when opening. It takes 1 second to open. That's the best part,5
"Insane app I have ever used. Mind-blowing results in a seconds, just want to say WOW.",5
Loving the voice interface! Can't wait for the option to train our own voice models.,5

"App is good, but lacks support for LaTex which the web version has. Please add support for this.",4

"Wow.. pure evil, uh... I mean genius! Did I even write this review? Um... Anyway, after a little fun with some experimental play, this has a lot of useful potential... and perhaps worry for the arts & literature folk?",5
"Could you please have ChatGPT read its response and provide it with a decent voice, perhaps a 1-star rating for now for being lazy not adding some features, 5star until this feature is added",1
"very useful program, definitely useful in gaining insight or knowledge on any sort of topic its allowed to share!",5
Great assistant. I just installed it and it is perfect. The answers are clear and precise. I highly recommend it for everyone.,4
"Earlier this ai was not available on Android but now it is , Since I started using it I really loved it , I gain alots of knowledge from this ai app and it's easy to use even so probably I give 5 stars to Chatgpt Cause it's best to help me up with various information. And has become on regular basis.",5
Downloaded this official app to try to get my feet wet in AI. So far it's given me very good information but I'm still not sure about everything it can do for me or if I need something else to help me with my business but so far so good!,5
"If you thought the website was awesome, the app is so much more. As a creative, it's a game-changer!",5
This Technology is very advance and the response of GPT 3 makes me go crazy. UI is amazing and its Chat GPT but in mobile app.,5

The app is incredible 😍😍😍. I tried the app in website but now finally the app launched.if the app could make images then it will be so useful 😎❤️,5
Some times it shows I apologize for any confusion. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021. Otherwise fantastic🤘😝🤘,4
"Well, chatgpt as an app. There's nothing more I could've asked for. I'm actually a student but I'm saving up to buy premium. Chatgpt has revolutionized the way I study and assimilate information. Thank you OpenAI, chatgpt will surely get me through medical school 😩",5
An important and quick tool of information in the modern progressive era of technology! looking foreward for advanced information with user based requirements,5
"Super fast , but not updated for latest info. Provides best info but it isn't fun using the app",4
"this isn't an ai that has a brain and is up to date, and it isn't your friend. it only generates tokens. get it right.",5
IT IS VERY USEFUL FOR STUDIES AND COMPLEX PROBLEMS. IT'S REALLY AMAZING EXPERIENCE TO CHAT WITH AI AND IT'S REALLY GOOD AND USEFUL,5
"I have never in my life think such an application ever exist, this is great. It answers all questions you could think of friends. 100% Recommendation for you guys!",5
"Good, but if Brave is the default browser it is not possible to log in any more. Earlier it worked.",4
"First time experience with chatGPT. It's really amazing assistant for a person. You can learn,you can help to develop the assistant but every functional time it tries it's best. I love to collect my information thorough this amazing assistant.",5
It is a very good app . And this is also available as website . It gives every information too fastly . Once you try it u will feel happy,5
Excellent Would recommend some sort of audio response (a beep or something). The app is weirdly quite for my liking.,4
"the AI is one thing, the fact the threw it in an ad free, simple plain app is another. excellent",5
"Just used it for a job application, blown away by the rewording and accuracy of the response.",5
"It's chatGPT after all but I didn't like the pages appearing, why I can't see my chats directly from the sidebar.",4
"Can't login. Auth is not working. I'm trying ""Continue with Google"" from yesterday. Still not working. Throwing an error.",1
Could you add the ability to collapse old messages so it didn't take so long to scroll to the most recent one,4
"Incredible app! It is the smartest, user-friendly, the fastest, and many more.",5
Excellent. Love having the app instead of a browser shortcut. Hopefully plugins are coming soon!,5
"Better than Google. Still, the app needs improvement in UI/UX compared to the iOS version!",5
It helps me to answer my difficult assignments and I can talk to it whenever I feel lonely. Five star for this! A life-saver!,5
the speach-to-text feature off this app is the greatest thing about this app. It's been 10minutes since I'm using the app and it's AMAZING!!!!!,5
It's great that the app allows for voice input it would be even greater if it could read the response back to you,5
"Instant 4 star for such a nice Android app. Navigation and Status bar are transparent, keyboard swipe animation is there. Just hit the nail on the first try! Please add Android 13+ themed icon support.",4
"Works better than the website, nice UI. Not a plus user so a I can't comment on how well it work for plugins/gpt4. Also, the voice to text is very, very good.",5
"Very well done. Accurate and keeps history. Would like to see text to speech integration....interactivity like Google Assistant, Siri and Alexa. But...baby steps, I suppose. Overall a good app!",5
"This is amazing. Much better than a Google search, and way easier to find the answers you are looking for. I'm glad this technology is available.",5
It keeps complaining about not being updated since September 2021 and it doesn't know recent things that has happened after 2021,1
"It behaves so humanly most times, I'm either in awe or scared. Either way, they are both positive responses to me haha.",5
The chatgpt app is a really good app and I hope to keep it in phone for a long time though I hope it doesn't require subscription,5
"Very good as an editor, it is a shame that the database only reaches to September 2021.",5
"Been unable to login keeps bringing up an error message, phone permission is allowed on play services yet it's still not working",2
Absolutely spot on in a very unique story telling encounter. This technology is as good as they say it is.,5
Useless app. Won't let you create an account. Also won't let you log in using your Google email.,1
Please fix the math output look and feel. The app is not rendering the math numbers and latex into correctly displayed functions.,4
This tool is excellent. I checked many other tools but their performance is not up the mark. Good thing is Gpt 3.5 is free,5
"not bad at all, it's quite responsive, and it's got a lovely UI, I'll wait until I try the GPT-4 so I can drop a more indept review",4
I'm finding that the lack of memory is a problem as it gets character details wrong once I'm getting further along.,3
"It's ChatGPT, what else can I say? The only problem I have with it is that ChatGPT 4 is waaaayyy too expensive for us Turkish people. If the prices change to something affordeble I will change my review. But overhaul it does deserve a 5 star rating its just the problems of mine.",4
"Finally was able to log in. More arduous than it had to be. Besides that, app seems to work great.",4
i think it should have the offline save option...also a highlighted option or important mark ...I hope u gave this on upcoming updates...,5
Ui problem please fix. After Mobile phone default dark mode on inside chatgpt question and answer not showing hide and blank. and when I make light mode means normal theme everything is see clearly...,1
this is very useful for students and this is so easy to knows the information about all and education also . this is so helpful for all,5
One of the best apps of all time ever created and in many ways has surpassed Google with ability to understand context,5
"Chatgpt is one of the greatest inventions in human history. Also, chatgpt is considered as a tutor for only $20 a month. Of course, tutors make mistakes, and you need to use your judgment and knowledge to be better than your tutors.",5
very nice. If possible I would love it if we could press the code windows it generates and check the code more clearly!,5
This app is very helpful and useful it's use easily and solve many types of problems this application can not any types of draw pictures,5
"The app technically works but it's VERY limited. It offers nothing new over the regular web interface we already had except now you can't pick plugins, upload files for code interpreter, nor set custom instructions. Months ago I had ChatGPT build me an app like this for PC but with TTS and custom wake phrase that knows if you're talking to it or about it to avoid the false positives seen in Alexa and Google Home. It took me just thirty minutes. This app is lazy, featureless, and uninspired.",1
"I appreciate the minimalist nature of this app, allowing it to run on slower devices and take up little space. Additionally, the integration of GPT-3.5 architecture ensures that the responses are remarkably coherent and contextually appropriate.",5
"ChatGPT can be a great tool for learning. With dangers of misuse, I feel it must be well regulated.",5
"Maybe they can improve the fact of copy and paste, since to copy text, it is necessary to enter ""copy mode"" I would suggest thinking more about the UX, I would like them to add the menu button that we have on the web, something like smooth scrolling and The menu is hidden, but the button is always visible. and please update to GPT-5 now, I imagine it will have internet access, and even more so, that it has current data (2023)+ that would be super cool",5
"Ridiculous Login Requests This App is like fraud, it's requesting tons of users information like phone number, email, d.o.b, user accounts etc this isn't how modern Apps usually behave",1
excellent helping tool. make sure for great performance in the office space and cuts on time consumption,4
Should add a reading thing so I don't have to read it. Also add a pause button for reading so if there is a long chat,5
"ChatGPT Android app offers a fascinating glimpse into the capabilities of AI language models. Its natural language processing is impressive, providing helpful responses and engaging conversations. The app's user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, making it accessible for users of all backgrounds. However, since it relies on pre-existing data, it might not be up-to-date with the latest information. Overall, it's an enjoyable and useful tool for various tasks.",4
"Really impressed with the performance of this AI ,app easy to navigate through and everything else is just okay",5
"May be it's just me but after reading reviews, most of them feel like they've been written using ChatGPT itself. I'm not saying they are wrong or false, but damn they are creepy once you start to see the patterns..",5
This is best app I ever found on Google Play Store. I am really satisfied with the answers it provides. Thanks to OPEN AI for developing such a helpful ai model,5
Unfortunately this app has only been updated to September of 2021 so it can't deal with current problems.,3
"Very interactive app, good for research and related. I highly recommend it.",5
"It's great but it keeps crashing every now and then, which keeps resulting in me uninstalling and re-installing",3
Excellent app! This app is best for doing school assignments. But some response are very short.,5
The best AI Assistant by far! Now that this app is here I don't need to use chrome to use ChatGPT all the time!!! Good job OpenAI👍,5
"It is excellent on lots of different applications. Unfortunately, it is not perfect. Give it another five or ten years and we will all be using it.",4
"I was enjoying the experience up until recently. When you type in a question and it answers, it's very difficult to type in another question other than to record",3
"As an avid user of language models, I must say that ChatGPT is an absolute game-changer in the world of conversations! This app has revolutionized the way we interact and communicate, making it an indispensable tool for various tasks.",5
"It is very good for school projects, homework. Using chatgpt is just mind blowing. It can give you more knowledge than you can find anywhere else.",4

"My experience with this app has been exceptional, I'm happy to say it's an excellent app. I look forward to updates.",5
"Makes my studies a breeze, I usually am kind of shy to ask many questions to a teacher. This is like the best and most patient teacher ever😅",5
I have an account which I just deleted and not to create a new account I need to provide a mobile no. But I only have 1 mobile and I can't logout anymore. Please fix [this bug],1
"ChatGPT is an impressive and versatile AI language model. Its ability to understand and respond to a wide range of topics is truly remarkable. Whether I need assistance with general knowledge, creative writing, or problem-solving, ChatGPT consistently delivers accurate and insightful responses.",5

It will be amazing if you could add an optional audio reader for answers.,5
"Surprisingly Good...i mean the AI itself is bordering on mediocre nowadays, but all is smooth and designed really REALLY well!",4
that's so awesome and exciting. Chat GPT helps to explain complex topic in just simple words for better understanding,4
I feel like this is one of if not the only app on Android that takes advantage of the Pixel's haptics. It honestly feels great using this app. The rest of the experience is how you would expect when using ChatGPT. This is probably the best AI app out right now.,5
"It's amazing, it helps me very much to learn new things and it also provide really beautiful and helpful ideas",4
My Experience with chatGPT is poor. The speed of answering is slow. And not any additional features in Android app .,1
"That's really an awesome app, ChatGPT, I've asked questions about various topic and really am appreciated over its. Thank you for assisting. ✨",5
"The code color highlighting not displayed When we switch from dark to light theme, the text remains white and we can't see the response",3
"This is a very helpful app, especially for children who are still currently learning in school.",5
"This app has eased my graduate studies. It's fast, easy to use and gives reliable information",5
Not giving the up to date information. Most information were last update in 2021.,1
Love this app!! I liked how it is free unlike other AI apps and always gives instant results.,5
"nice experience in the app, awesome ui, simple and easy, and obviously a much better than the website,",4
Paid for a subscription got points for purchase though app store.. and it's still on free plan.. not happy,1
"Great UI, smooth animations and transitions, so far so good",5
Latest update is very bad. There are so many wrong data about many questions. At first fix those problems.,1
Very useful and friendly AI but a problem is the version of this AI pls update this AI it will definitely a good updated AI. It don't know current president too.,4
It's a great app you have to try it but sometimes it can't gives you accurate answer of math problem sum if it not understood other wise it best,4
Awesome The app is good to interact with and has nice interface. Now we can use Chatgpt without any hassles.,5
Love this app just need to keep all the informations up to date it says that it contains information until September 2021 and the second thing is need access to the internet Thanks. Guys pls use this app you would love it❤️❤️,4
"I love chatgpt, unfortunately i have one compliant, when i downloaded the app i could check my previous history and then continue previous conversations, now I can't",4
"Fantastic app! ChatGPT's AI responses are impressively natural, making conversations a breeze. Highly recommended!",5
this AI can't provide ourselves any type of photos and location and other services but all type of answers it have that's why I like it ☺️,4
"Hi everybody! I have never seen this application before. Do you need some problems with society .You can discuss this application anytime. All reply and advise are valuable items. This application is my professor, instructor, or guide. Download now. You must be satisfied for their advise. Thank you again.",5
it's an amazing app. it will be more better if image displays are also updated.,5
"This is great, It's very helpful for us student and I like it, I can't wait for further improvements of the app.",5
"ChatGPT has truly reshaped my expectations for AI-based communication. The app is user-friendly, intuitive, and boasts a remarkably clever AI, capable of understanding and responding to a diverse array of inquiries. It's proven to be a reliable companion for everything from quick questions to in-depth discussions. While there is the occasional hiccup in comprehension or interpretation, the frequency of these moments is surprisingly low. The developers clearly continue to invest in updates and im",4
"I have no words, but still needs a lot of changes regarding maths and stuff. Really helped me",5
"Great app with absolutely no ads what's how ever, no chat limit and very intelligent best AI app so far, would rate more if I could",5

very good application. works very well and smooth quick response with features.,5
"This is so much useful app, I got so much help from this app. This is also simple to use nd is so smooth. Thnx a lot team AI.",5
"ChatGPT must have been launched on the Google play store before than Apple store. By the way. Because of this unique AI software i am able to learn many things. Today I was watching video of WSJ. There was journalist of WSJ, he was using word inflation. I was kind of confused that what does it exactly mean. I opened the Google store for doing something. But it appeared on the front. I downloaded it. I searched meaning of inflation. Now I know that what does it mean.",5
It's getting better and faster updates after updates. Hopefully it will be able to provide the source of the information soon.,5
Finally the official app is out! No more limited third party APIs that cost $$$ for basic functionality. This is the most helpful educational and productivity app on the planet if you use it. It's also a lot of fun!,5
"Poor UI, Try to make it like Bing Ai. You are not investing properly on the UI and it's always slow and laggy in the app",1
It should give some more aspects and related links in approvance.And it should also give same text of books(copies).Well it Is Unique app,5
Most question that i ask it doesn't have answer Like I asked which is a perfect language in the whole world it started comfusing me I asked who is a mla of aurangabad it says that I can only tell you the events before 2021 It's not that useful actually just like a new software,2
"the generated responses are very helpful and this ai is very useful for learning new things, collecting information and doing writing work",5
Amazing user interface and the speech to text feature is quite useful!,5
"Can't register. Tried it several days now. Always says: Signup is currently unavailable, please try again later. No im not trying it anymore. I'm done",1
Feature demand : we want search bar widget so that we can access it with ease replacing Google search bar widget in Android.,5
"A Very Effective and Simple Language Assistant! I've been using the ChatGPT Android app for a while, and I have to tell that it's been a very wonderful experience! The language model for the app, which is powered by GPT-3.5, is tremendously strong and adaptable. The app's user-friendly layout was the first thing that grabbed my interest. The software is easy to use and has logical navigation, making it simple to access all the functions.",5
sometimes the chatbot recalls information incorrectly and needs to be corrected I usually have fun talking to it in my free time regardless of any issues present,4
This is pretty phenomenal. SO MUCH INFO THATS SO BENEFICIAL. I asked to give me a description about The Great Depression and MAN it went all out. I DO RECOMMEND,5
it's a favorite personal partner! somebody (virtual) who tends to have on point answers to every query so far!,5
"The app wotks fine but when I use my web account I don't see any conversation that I have did with, also there is a problem in dark mode..",3
It was an official app of chat got by openAI this is a very helpful tool and a next generation step to AI. I like it too much. Thank you Open AI,5
I think this must be updated to the latest sate and year. It really helped me a lot. Please update chatgpt 3.5 to the latest date and year.,4
"I love this application, is this possible to get information in other formats as well like image, vedios, pdf etc would be great!!!",5
"This is sweet. It naturally has a way of humanising our writeups, especially when we rephrase.",5
ChatGPT is a great tool than can be used in all Professional work and it's been incredibly helpful in my work. 👍,5
it is a very good thing to have such a powerful ai tool available for normal citizens but I would really like to see its full potential can be used by every single person to produce the 100% outcome of his work without any charges to be given.,4
"This application is new, it has silly problems but I hope OpenAI will bring a lot of tools in future. I'm impressed that OpenAI published the Chatgpt 3.5 mobile version for free, it's quite fast and accurate.",5
Loved the paid version. It made my life easy. I can do 5 hours of research in a few minutes.,5
"It's an amazing app , you must check it out . I really enjoy the app , It's something more than amazing , it's very user-friendly and helpful.",5
The best and strongest AI till now in my openion. Keep working on this!!👍 This will definitely change the shape of this civilisation one day🔥 🙏All the Best👍,5
Not much experience than chrome and it's information too & showing the results of 2021 before is like not knowing complete information of the subject,1
Honestly this app is so good.... Other similar apps had questions limit but in this app it's unlimited and i love it.... Very easy to understand....,5
"Very bad experience in this openAi service because a mobile no is link with an account but showing that ""this no is link with multiple accounts""",1
It is the best app i have ever seen. Its very good . Its like a friend with you that gives your questions answer everytime.,5
"this is the best assisting app ever, it can break down this to your understanding, and fun to chat with .",5
Very good and helping ...but not updated beyond 2021 ..all information and explanations are based upon knowledge before 2021,4
So far I love the free version. Been simple to use and it has understood each request I've asked of it.,5
better than web version and fast response and good gui also but have a problem like some of buttons are missing in app version from web version,5
"other than the obnoxious ""I am a model by OpenAI and it spewing bs before saying HOWEVER and then answer which is super annoying, it's a very useful tool""",4
"My ultimate coding companion! Instant solutions, fresh ideas, and a tech-savvy mentor in my pocket.",5
Before we should open ai from our chrome brouser but its very goid feature that it came a play store.Its very very good and amazing feature that it answers all the questiin in any language we ask to it,5
"هو تطبيق جيد لكن لديه بعض المعلومات الخاطئة و اتمنى ان تحدث معاوماته الى معلومات 2022 It's a good app but it has some incorrect information I hope that its information will be updated in 2022 or 2023, if possible",4
"Seems ok, but the app gives any mathematical equations in the LaTeX format, which is almost unreadable",3
"Need to keep up with the trend and happenings, would love to see a chat share option in mobile version..😊",4
Good app but it's voice prompt feature should be improved. It has bugs.,4
"A very great ai app,but sometimes,the response or the solution to question I ask is wrong or the formula which is applied is also sometimes wrong .",4
voice typing needs severe upgrade it's literally not working. Loved the app otherwise.,3
I think ChatGPT is the best AI app that can help you a lot.It helped me in many ways ranging from Tech to food and much more,5
"chatgpt very helpful, is really boosting up everything anyone find doing it ,writing is there for you what about programming is there for you. I just want to encourage everyone getting into the the game of chatgpt before such a one become back obsolete in this generation o, chatgpt is very efficient and up to any task you send he reply without delay I like chatgpt very well and more importantly there are many version s of chatgpt and all very good on the stages of your development with chatgp",4
very insightful and helping to explore ideas from different sources in short time and give directions to reliable sources for one to find a right path in various issues of their interest.,4
please optimize for keyboard-mouse support. scrolling with keyboard-mouse is difficult.,3
A unique and ingenious system with a more user friendly focus than asking questions via a search engine.,5
An excellent digital buddy. Expecting more features in the near future. Lets evolve together with AI. I hope we will be end up in creating the Terminators. 😁,5
"Good app . It helps us in many ways.. sometimes , we are in a confusion, but the A.I gives us right opinion .😃😃",5
Not too good for real information. It is good as a training tool for the subscription tool.,1
"A really good app, like it. It really makes me happy when I talk to it . Keep going ahead, best of luck!",5
Easy to use but it is not letting me watch and delete my history. It's showing 'Error occurred'!,2

"First impression on ChatGPT, great and user friendly 😃 especially like the feature of exporting the chat. Nice work guys 👍",5
Amazing app. Do recommend. Response time is a bit slow but works very well.,4
There is no app that has ever assisted and impressed me like Chat GPT. I promote the app. I tell everyone about it. And I'll keep doing that !,5
The app is not giving any answers to my queations. Amd keeps saying my network is error Even though my internet speed is completely okay😡😡,1
"Constantly not available due to ""network error"" despite everything else on my phone working fine, whether WiFi or 5G.",1
ChatGPT Thank you so much!! This app really helped me alot for my research and assignments! This app is really helpful.,5
"Love to see it come to mobile but i cant log in,i click on the log in button i type in my open ai's account credentials and when i hit log in it just brings me back the the log in thing",1
Although ChatGPT was fun to use I am just loving the new voice feature. The best thing is that it is free,4
Not working without Google Chrome. I'm using Firefox and deleted chrome on my phone I don't want to install chrome again.,1
I think this app can teach better than techers or professor it can understand our language and answer in language in which you ask the question,5
"Very interesting app, funny questions answers and tips she gives, I can have some funny conversations with her, really she can tell amazing love stories. Wishing him continued success.",5
pretty fast and I'm thinking on getting gpt-4 but gpt-3.5 is great it's fast it works well it gives me the answers that I asked/wanted for (:,5

"Life Changer app for Students. I m literally Shocked, when I type any types of questions, This ChatGPT gives pointed answer. Which I needed😍💌 I fully recommended you to use this ChatGPT, You will never disappoint........",5
Can't login with Google account. The app wouldn't respond even though my internet connection is intact.,1
This aap is very useful but the problem is it doesn't shows pictures I asked for drawing and they are telling they can't share pictures,4
it became very lagging lately especially on my phone. even logging in takes plenty of time and often failed,1
I love this. As much for the sting it caused 600 knock off apps that made gross profits off of the same API available on Bing for free. Thanks! lol,5
"So far 5 of 5! Very helpful and enjoyable collaborator for recapturing some awesome ideas such as, pro-human, interfaith bill of rights concepts, and pro-children-rights policies for positive brainstorming. I will continue to use with much gratitude!",5

"Very good app. Just that it does not know anything after September 2021, which is quite boring.But it is class",5
It allows me to log in using my Microsoft account on the browser version but I cannot log in using the same credentials on this android app. So right it's trash and it doesn't work. Uninstalled!!,1
This app is just lit. You just have to give the right prompts in order to get the results you desire.,5
"Great. But please add ability to edit previous query without having to re-typye, just like on the web app...",5
Original: App icon doesn't support theming. Updated: App icon supports theming now. Developer response was quick 🙂,5
I've been using ChatGPT since April and this app since its release. It's absolutely amazing.,5

Still No Payment Subscription. Make it soon to enjoy the application. The application is almost good.,5
It needs to be updated the last update was 2021 which is not giving me the current/update answers apart from that it's a very good app to use,2
"The best app ever seen it does your every solution,it is the easy way to learn fast,it gives ans to every question in simple way,apart chatting with gf/bf user should chat with ChatGPT...",5
sometimes it is just a more hard to understand some things because that are too high level.,4
It was wonderful experience ever I had since I'd never interacted with such intellectual platform having enormous potential to answer questions so much precisely it's fine that it lacks in solving JEE level maths questions but it has scientific approach in answering the questions which is comparatively better choice than other searching platforms..,5
The turned out to be a nice one. The response time on app is way faster than web. Some small features like haptic feedback are making it more beautiful.,5
this aap is so much good and very helpful when I don't understand any thing in school I come direct here and ask chat gpt about that and it give the perfect and very well as I have wanted.. thank u so much to you for providing a helpful source,5

Good. I like it . Pretty helpful . But it should have the ability to accept and return images as well .,5
"This app is really awesome,,,it gives me some relief,,,the app tries to help as much as possible by posting like its people.",5
Great platform! It's almost weird how intelligently ChatGPT interacts. Kudos!,5
Fantastic app addition in my mobile phone. I'm waiting for Android now it's comes. Super fast than web version... Thanks OpenAI.,4
What a disgrace by AI experts that app gets stuck on login and signup process so there's no way to actually use it.,1
this is the best app ever I have found so far. it can solve 99.9 % of your problems.... rest 0.1 is no one can ✌️,5
This is a fantastic AI as in Google it will make us fells we are in problem but this AI is just opposite so this is a good AI but it will need some updates.,5
"Its the best assistant its better than Siri or alexa but there's a problem the problem i's when i say ""can i call you Alexa?"" it’s says ok but when i say ""hi Alexa"" it’s says ""you cant call me by this name"" so fix it",5
The app is user friendly and helpful for generating thoughts that we need to know and it helps us to go beyond the human thought can go.,5
this app is the best thing I have ever seen if I could give it 10 stars I would it is honest and you get what you are looking for Thank you ChatGPT!!!!!!!!,5
"Very First and reliable however, I'm also suggesting that you should provide a photo upload botton.",4
"it works perfectly, it's the official chatgpt from opening its not the knock offs but I took away a star because not everything is fully to date.",4
perfect system that gives clear and concise answers immediately.,5
Best thing ever. It's getting easier to use and extremely helpful in every day tasks.,5

Please add app for wearable OS and support for plugins and it will be perfect!,4
"Can not login, all the time i have to log in, solve captcha and again cell to insert email adress",1
its really really helpful for school and universities students in academic basis.,5
this app is more useful for 10th class and that brainly app taking money like for year 1094 and for month 109 we should pay for brainly app CHAT GPT IS THE BEST APP IT IS MORE USEFULL,5
"All I can say is...this app is excellent. One request though, please update its AI.",5
I'm uninstalling. The puzzle to verify me as a person takes forever to load.,1
it is extremely useful for assignment and project work for students,5

Great app Has literally changed the way is study and work.,5

Very experiencble app whenever you stuck at any stage you can use it for a instantly rapid response and and ques,5
I'm glad to know that this type of app exist..honestly i wish I knew about this app earlier. the reason why I gave this a 4 star instead of 5 is because it doesn't show images...would have been much better with that,4
most comfortable app for making researches! I really Thank OpenAI for converting ChatGPT from a website into an app! This is simply awesome!,5
It's good but it needs to have a function that allows dark fantasy or stories. Letting the app make concept stories for dark fantasies could help aspirin dark fantasy authors Not just dark fantasy even dark sci fi,4

"I would prefer having the beta add-ons for this and/or Code Interpreter. If this is using Whisper, I appreciate that element for the on-the-go nature.",4
The UI is simple and straight forward. Can't wait to see how it changes over time. Thanks to OpenAI team.,5

"ChatGPT is an incredible language model that's become an indispensable tool on my Android device. Its ability to understand and respond to a wide range of topics is impressive. I use it for quick answers to questions, brainstorming ideas, and even for entertainment through creative storytelling. The app's user interface is clean and intuitive, making it easy to interact with ChatGPT. Whether you need assistance or just want to have some fun conversations, ChatGPT is the perfect companion.",5
This is a very great assistant to have. It gives me answers to literally anything.,5
"good but there's no option of saving the answer and solutions provided in it by the ai, so it kind of becomes, stressing",2
"Dope app, it is very advanced, more than expectations, the amount of knowledge it has is unmeasurable.",5
"Terrible. Not able to create an account using the login setup system, neither by Gmail account or create a new account with chatgpt",1

"Really good, sometimes the AI will misinterpret the question, that's why you have to be really specific with it",4
"When I try to login with Google, it says to enable cookies. My cookies are already enabled but it still won't work. BROKEN.",1

its a great way to test out this AI on android without having to be on your pc or in a slow browser.,5
"this app give me a huge boost to speed my learning,but I hope it will get updated soon,and coming up with pictures and voices with the response",4
The much awaited app is now functional. Thanks to the entire team for bringing up a revolutionary app for the whole world..,5

It is absolutely a game changer AI but doesn't has much educational information i would like it if it has a-z educational knowledge,3
"Overall great, but the only issue I have is that this app can't seem to process the LaTeX typesetting.",4
It's here in India! 😲 WOW At last I can see the authentic Chat GPT app on my phone! Now it makes more sense to buy the paid subscription to Chat GPT 4. Thanks!,5
"Good interface, but very limited formatting / LaTeX support compared to the web version.",4
The app is very good. It answers all my questions. But sometime it canot. I thnk that if we had chat gpt voice assistant,4
"Easy to use. But the inability of accessing new incidents lacks the experience. However as long as it is under the control of human being, we are good. 😊✌️",5
Excellent and exciting way to learn so many things. Very helpful tool indeed.,5
I've had a wonderful experience using this app so far my highly. Recommend it to anyone who writes books.,5
"""ChatGPT is low-key lit, fam! It's crazy accurate and hella impressive. It's like having a super-smart homie right in your phone!""",5
It's all correct and also fantastic but I will request to update.As It has only the news till September 2021. So I gave only 4 ⭐⭐⭐⭐ stars.,4
"I'm glad they made a native app for ChatGPT. Performance is definitively faster than the browser version. But the app lacks so many features, especially for ChatGPT Plus users. The app doesnt have an edit prompt feature, which is very useful when you make mistake in your prompt, and want to revise it. It also lacks the beta features, the plugin and code interpreter mode.",3
"An amazing and simple app that answers questions in the most incredible way ,ChatGBT team keep up the good work",5
I don't know what to expect but it needs to get updated like chatsonic but the better thing is that you have infinite words.,5
"This chatgpt app in particular cant solve complex math,physics and chemistry questions.thats just the problem with it.",2
soo smart it gives so many information and can be understand very easily💯,5
Great App!! Though I wish they would link features from PC to the android version.,5
"I'm still confused but I believe the more"" we"" grow and learn together the better both of our futures with coexistance as our forefront model objective and outcome to be. We'll both be just fine.",4
Pointless app: it's just the Web site wrapped in an app. I expected I could converse: speak to it and it would speak back to me.,1
"Overall great ai but sometimes it gets way difficult to chat with, because of the restrictions.",4
"It is more convenient since I'm not good at making paragraph, I appreciate your work and be honest guys, it's way more useful❤️ Love your app❤️",5
I have been using this since 3months.And I must say I am fully satisfied with this new technological innovation which makes humankind more easier than ever.,5
"Unable to login says ""something went wrong"" all the time. Very frustrating.",1
"the true definition of Ai, this app is so accurate though please try to update on the data knowledge because the one of 2021 is out of date.",5
absolutely awesome to get the exact information for the particular query.make things easier to the user.,5
It's exactly what you'd want an AI chat app to be. Simple and intuitive.,5

Place an back icon in the sidebar the user don't know how to slide the slidebar and it's full in width covers the whole screen,4
"excellent interface,prompt response,high accuracy, matacuilously designed..",5
no new features there is no updates ni scan option no photo generate option I was dissatisfied,1
"basic, clean, no ads. finally a good android app and also seems super secure also most basic design ever seen also works with my language",5
"Does not have feature to enable plugin, also the audio to text breaks at times",4
This app is very useful for study gives easy sentence for study but don't give diagrams so I give only 4 stars,4
This is a very impressive effort. This app is awesomely fantastic and wonderful. I believe it can also be improved upon. Well done.,5
"no message limitation on how many times i could send per day bullcrap unlike other chatbots plagued with subscription, its enough for free and is worth subscribing :3",5
"Just really amazed at what is possible with ChatGPT. It's like having your own virtual assistant with you wherever you go. Of course the key thing to remember is that this is AI, not God, therefore you won't get any prophetic words. Also keep in mind that ChatGPT strength as a tool is only as good as the worker handling it: therefore if you're stupid don't expect anything from it bevause you'll always use your tools incorrectly.",5
"It keep saying check ur time and date and then ur internet connection, takes to log in page but keep popping this error,unable to log in",1
it is very useful to us(children) for exam answers and all and also for math equation.,4
good platform to get the required quality content. Also saving the time,5
It is so amazing. Helping me sort out all types if writing researching and analysing problems. thanks to science,5
it doesn't work on my phone. it says please make sure you have the latest version of google play when i try to log in with my email.,1
The information provided by ChatGPT is wonderful . It explains in a easy way and it is more statifaction .,5
"Very effective thus far with its responses. Informative, innovative, and very useful.",5
"Awesome. What? You wanted a full and in depth explanation of my experience? Ha, keep dreaming, buddy.",5
"ChatGPT always, always, always useful. Very smart. Thank you developers for this kind app. 🤍 I am having a problem with my history though, the settings were set to save the chats but it gets deleted and says ""Error occured. Try again later."" This has been going on for days! I want to save our chats and retrieve ""lost"" chats.😭",5
Fastest response time I have gotten from any platform for ChatGPT. Excellent build. No bugs yet!,5
It doesn't know through which platform it operates and that's awesome BC you are directly in interaction with the source.,5
"Love the experience, but the database seems to be limited with info up to Sep 2021. Nearly two years in the dark? Hope things will change...",4
"Best app ever! Whit this high programed up bot and AI! all solving from questions, hard math and science, to also Creating APPS. AMAZING!!",5
ChatGPT 4 is Mind-blowing. It really enables me and help me accomplish tasks I deemed impossible before.,5
Unable to login or verify number for new account for no reason. Poor service,1
"Powerful tool for generating text, answering questions and automating tasks. Must try app!",5
Doesn't work anymore. Just freezes when I click on it.,2
I use this app for few times and I discover it is Marvelous . really good. I support it with my heart ❤️💓,5
it is a very powerful tools for brainstorming and research. I use it in 50% of my office work.,5
It's very ok I'm not Going to lie but when I try to enter and attempted many passwords and even though I reseted my passwords it didn't let me in.. soooo,3
This ChatGPT app is like a person. The most helpful app ever. I won't feel lonely anymore. I love it♥️,5
Couldn't ask for a better assistant. Hoping for a voice model training feature..,5
"Amazing. One this MISSING !! Add ""find"" option so that one can search a certain info of the chat",5
I so love chatgtp this all is just what I need I'm a learner I love to learn about anything and everything but I'm often left with a lot of questions and this app has all the answers for me.,5
Good beginning. Clean UI and near perfect search results.,4
Works just like the website application. Very simple to use. No issues at the moment.,5
ive been waiting so so long for the android version and i rlly like it! i also adore the history feature. nice work openai :),5
Awesome App for the teacher and students.. And you have to increase the mathematical functions..,5
"the app keep giving me error: An error has occurred, please try again later.",1
It helps a lot in studys and provide correct information with maximum details it. However it depends on the users that how they use this AI to collect their information.,5
amazing helped with my essay though I hate the limitations on it making it only positive or neutral,5
This so far has been really great and responsive in time. I highly recommend if you need help with something to ask chatgpt.,5
"Love the app, I think it may need more features and improvements. But still it's awesome",5
honestly the best tool for school work cause it can guide you make you understand and grade you or even ask it answer you in a specific age group and the way i talk to it it makes feel like I'm talking to a person,5
nice but there is a lack of diagram and chat explanation with a picture,5
"Amazing, love, the story writing with 3. 4 reads like a news person. Need update past September of 2021",4
"nice, but can be better (since I pay more than 20 bucks monthly)",5
Actually the main problem is it has the information before September and can't provide fresh news . I kindly request OPEN AI to provide correct answers and fresh News daily . Thank you Open AI team for creating a website 😁 . THANKS REGARDS AZIM KHALID,5
I have been using chat gpt from chrome and mainly for coding solutions.but this mobile app is an utter waste when you are using this for programming answers cuz it is not ordered.,2
"The down arrow ⬇️ hides the letters written in chat. Please solve this issue as soon as possible 🙏. Anyways, no other complains😊",4
"The construct of this should be adjusted; or at least allow someone to request an adjustment; for friendly conversation sans the customer service tone. Friends, in most cases, do not say things like: if there's anything else you want to discuss, just let me know! or I am here to assist when you need me. We call each other by name or not at all, and just say what is on our minds and expect that the other party will do the same.",5
Siuuuu......what an app...its of great help to me in solving difficult problems in my studies...i love it...thnx :),5
This application is changed my life .Really this is super fast as part from that it provides concise answer as you questioned .Iam really impressed from this applucation,5
Couldn't get past the login page because it requires Chrom to sign in. I use Firefox so unfortunately this app isn't usable,2
"not working at all.its been more than a month im trying to sign up , never got code by text, please don't start service while you're not ready,",1
It's an amazing app it really helps in everything. But I think it would be a good decision to add modes,5
UI is so basic. Voice interpretation is not working well.,3
"Best and simple , all i wish is to update its information to the latest as of now , it has been limited to 2021",4
Open AI made it more easy to use this revolutionary tool than before. Thanks for everything!,5
When I want to run it and login then an ad is going to be of three leaves and the download seems to be automatic.,1
"Everything is good but, if there is a edit button to edit our Prompt, so we practice more to upskill our prompting skills 🙏",4
It's good finally have the app. But we also need the possibility to use the plugins + Bing GPT 🙌,3
Free version is providing wrong information and mostly limited to short content when i want some detailed content . .,1
Was loving this app before it stopped working and kept crashing... Lost the storyline I got super involved in.,2
"Not alll that good from the reviews and questions I've seen this was making code easy,but as soon as I get it,it cant make a lick of code.this was supposed to help people who can't code but all I got is hire some one to do it like really 😂",1
website is still better as I can search for a specific text. also text to speech will be good,4
I mostly used the web version and I'll say this is absolutely amazing. It's really smooth and I am glad it is free to use as well.,5
"Dear team, Please update the data, many times response this ""As of my last update in September 2021, I don't have information beyond that date""",3
GPT's app service seems great but i would love to have gpt with voice. It'll make the conversations more better.,5
Very helpful for all students and research works,5
"ChatGPT can do basically anything. It can write code, emails, draft documents and more, summarize and organize stuff and more. There are certain problems, especially with the code part since the generated code doesn't work all the time.",4
"fantastic piece of tech make every letter writing experience easy and fun , it is of great convenience to have chat gpt",4
"It's like the most amazing and useful app, I mean obviously it helped me with so many doubts this app is totally amazing! 5/5 indeed!!!!",5
"add code highlighting features, and edit option in previous query. like website, which is more better than apps",3
It wasn't working bc I didn't have chrome but they've changed and now it works. Thanks.,5
"It's been a long time coming, but I do have some problems. For example, unlike the desktop version, the app doesn't seem to enable me eliminate particular prompts from a discussion. Additionally, the censoring almost completely destroys any opportunity for storytelling (and, by the way, it doesn't even regularly uphold its own standards). Otherwise, it's a great resource. Additionally, it continually enters a crash cycle that is only momentarily repaired when the app data is cleared.",2
"Way different experience than the web, seems like it's using a different data set even if you pay",1
"if you have a emergency paper to write, this will help. but you will need to go through and make it cohesive.",5
"A great app.Should also have option of making ai images and graph plottings,tables and many more things but still love it",5
ChatGPT is so good for simplifying text just ask ChatGPT and you can easily simplify your text with one click,5
"It's just the best, though I wish I can edit my prompts and I wish it has read aloud capabilities.",5
I really like the smooth experience and speed of the responses. This is a really great app,5
It keeps telling me it has only he knowledge up to September 2021 so it doesn't know what else is happening till now I hope this gets fixed soon🙏,3
I'm glad ChatGPT finally has an app. I've been waiting for a long time and the app does not disappoint. It's fast and much more convenient. Thank you!,5
"well ,it's a very good app the only thing you just need is to create courage and follow your dreams from it",3
"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Seamless Experience: A rare gem in the app world! No ads and effortless usability make this app a true standout.""",5
It is a example of improving 21st century technology and artificial intelligence. This app can change the world.,5
Amazing AI. Though it sucks that a lot of the data on its database is limited to 2021 and below,4
well if you looking for creative short cuts for story ideas or a starting ground for resource in learn it might help.,5
it is very amazing app but I think if they would add photos and videos options it would be more better,4
although it is absolutely flawless i do think saving the chat should be an option and the informations should be upto date,5
"amazing, responsive, intuitive as expected, text to speech is mind blowing",5
"""I have benefited greatly from using this app. Through this app, I can learn many things very easily. My life journey has become much easier for me.""",4
Won't open . Says that my device date and time may be wrong??? . Epic fail don't bother installing this,1
"Great app it answers questions perfectly and can be used friendly, there are no ads and it has alot of capabilities",5
"Does just what it says, I've asked it tons of questions and gives me so much more detailed of a clean and lengthy answer, better than Google does even.",5
"if you're not learning chatGPT or any AI for that matter, consider doing so. This will be around for a long time. my first exposure to AI was around 1989... it's not new...",5
Superb app. Please add more advanced features. Thank you for this awesome product 🙏,5
I miss the edit prompt option after sending a prompt. Its there in the web version but not here.,5
"it gives me exactly what I need.but if it could function without data ,that would be more excellent.nice app thou !!!",5
It's fast and ti the point. Not a high faluten app at all. Just no fake- It's for real.,5
Really I am in love with this app... It is much more better than Google and YouTube... It provides information according to our mental level... It's Really an amazing app...,5
Just awesome! I'm learning to speak Spanish and ChatGPT makes for a great chat partner in Spanish!,5
App is really good. Clean minimalistic design. Smooth UI.,5
The app scenes carefully design as far as the Android app goes. No complaints at all so far.,5
"User friendly, speedy results that are extremely better than Microsoft AI. My go to AI is ChatGPT!",5
"We are getting closer to generic AI, this app is just a very simple interface...",5
superb but the islamic related things are not accurate it show varies result,5
"Good application, but it have to provide the courser on the right for Arabic ... It addition to this please create widget for this wonderful app",4
Indeed it's proving to be effective digital assistant helping in personal and professional work.,5
"it doesn't really understand random questions, it wants you to be more specific and more detailed",3
The best I would literally delete every app on my phone for this thank you for the free app it could literally save many time for us🥰🥰,5
i like it but sometimes glitches haplen and i cant generate stuff and these glitches are happening more often now a days.,4
"a perfect friend, a nice fellow to discuss almost everything with and for sure giving all the stuff I need.",5
"Alot easier to access when it's in an app rather than a website, and it works perfectly",5
It should try to give online links and also there should be an option of camera to upload photos of essay or other,4
"ChatGPT is very useful program, use it positively and get benefits. I recommend it.",5
I have found a bug but unable to report it. Even open AI s website is not working well while reporting.,1
It is a very good and useful app. ChatGPT was alone a useful website and now the app makes it more accessible.,5
"I love ChatGPT, but it won't let me login with my Google account. I already have an account with Google and I'm trying to continue with Google but it keeps saying something went wrong. HELP.",5
This app is remarkable and surprisingly simple and easy to use,5
Why chrome login is essential for opening? Nothing changed after updating. I don't want to open chrome for using it,1
Most extremely useful. This is Indeed An Excellent Fantastic Mind blowing AI. It has helped me a lot in my IIT JEE prep.,5
The best free service without hard terms as some copies .. light on devices and fast .. All respect for the developers,5
Great so far! Would be more fun if this shows some best search results ftom the web as well.,4
a good AI app but if it can use photos from Google too it will be better than Google,4
Superb app very useful for students..... I tested .. But in English grammar sometimes it2 gives some confusing answer...,5
A very good app answer most of your questions and helps in every thing I am a student and it helps me to write essays question,4
This app is super. I have never seen an AI app as interesting as this. At a scale of 20 I will be giving this app 19,5

Those who are seeing here this is the real Chat GPT before ending i wanted to tell that it can solve any type of equation or problem as wellas prove that of maths which is a very good feature of this AI.,5
"""The website is preferable because the app lacks the ability to edit our previously sent messages to ChatGPT, making it challenging for users. Please ensure that this issue is corrected.""",4
Many a times you don't get the answers you need or you get repetitions in answers but it's a real aid,4
I ask chatgpt to make a story about revolvor oceilot and mucky mouse trapping solid snake in a theme part and he had to steal the metal gear to escape it was so funny that I had to try to make my self to stop laughing because I couldn't breath 10 out of 10 👌🤣👌,5
So far working great. Much better than web version and very smooth and effective.,5
"Excellent app,especially for students.",4
The app is just excellent. It is one of the best apps I have interacted with. Thank you so very much the developers 💪,5
I signed up to your app but I never received the app confirmation response. Please look into the matter soon.,1
"The design and UX is a bit disappointing, but still better than using it on chrome.",4
Very useful application for Inatant Search results. The results needs a little more development.,5

Very basic functionality. Hopefully code interpreter and plugins will be added soon.,5

It's very useful and nice . Current version informations is until 2021. Please update to 2023.,5
Idk what's the use of static chatgpt 3.5 when Google Bard is already rolled and not static. Please roll a dynamic ChatGPT. Otherwise Google is taking you down.,3
the chat history could be a bit more intuitive,4
its good! but i can get some errors...but its fine mostly!,5
Wow...nothing else to say. Love the letter writing. Great support for real estate industry as well.,5
Most useful for learning. It solves my complex doubts within a fraction of second.,5

Amazing app. The one thing I'd like them to add is the option to HEAR ChatGPT's responses read out loud.,4
"I really like ChatGPT! It's a versatile and valuable AI tool, although it has some minor limitations. It's a useful resource for various text-related tasks. ChatGPT wrote this text....",5
"Google bard is better i ask for some suggestions its says I apologize, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time information or online shopping capabilities",1
"Excellent ai, why limit to got 3.5 tho, give users access to it's full capability and perhaps introduce ads to earn instead of subscription based model",5
It's okay... it's very limited on what I can do. But it works. It's VERY minimalistic and basic. I assume it will get better. But it works.,3
It is wonderful am short of words But I think it needs to be updated cus it is bringing result of 2021 and this is 2023 we will soon enter 2024 The distance is too much,4
is very helpful and sufficient it doesn't waste time in responding to day-to-day tasks I recommend for student go to plug,4
I'm loving the ai ability to tell stories and add it's own little ideas into the stories.,5
"Easy to navigate! Simple interface, fast load.",5
Need to be improved UI Web version UI is the best UI . Please implement the same ui in app,4
Good but request to open ai to update something more after the sept 2021 it is unable to provide data after that..please,4

Excellent app. But it is better if you allow to change background enterface.,5

This is the best AI App I have seen so far amongst many I have downloaded. Very simple and coordinated.,5
Very very very very useful app. I would like to thank the developer team to develope such an amazing app.,5
There is some UI BUG. The fonts are not visible in white or in bhalck back ground. Developer please check.,1
It's good. Been using for a while. Now that it's out on Android I can start a chat and continue it on my computer.,4
Everything is so good but Developer's should add a feature to read aloud the results.....,3
Its very good but it needs some update. It is giving some wrong informations.It is saying that he was last trained in 2021. So pls update this app,4

it feels the same as it is for the pc and laptop user with the same power but easily portable anywhere,5
"OpenAI are supposed to be the leaders and had the most time, but their app is the most limited, even compared to other apps which also use ChatGPT. Can't upload files/docs, limited voice UX. The input field behaves weirdly, when selecting text to replace, it selects the whole paragraph. Searching the internet with ChatGPT for contemporary information is really clunky (when possible at all). The LLM itself is amazing(!), but the app and interface to it is very basic.",2
"best app even if you are student,or in business or whatever field this app will help you i personally use this as a student and it help me a lot",5
This new update did nothing I was hoping it would have info past September 2021 with this new update. So why have this new update when it nothing.,4
"Add voice input also to the app , so that I could use like google .. kind ok ai or something... If possible it vl be great work",4
"While CGpt spins a nice story I am forced to verify every ""fact"" and here is where the wheels comes off. But I suppose it's early days still...",3

"This is the best application any man can think of, but I will appreciate it more when it has access to real time data",5
Really good for research purposes and I get really good and creative responses. I thank the developers for such a great and awesome Innovation as this 👍👍👍,5
Very productivity apps ever. It’s help me to reduced hassle. Less work more output.,5
"the app is good but only needed to display the images,when I ask to give a photo of Elon musk it say unfortunately we can't display the image's",4
"love this app for so many reasons, but it genuinely helps with product descriptions, website copy and blog posts. I highly recommend this 👌",5

"Another app made for the sole purpose of collecting personal data. Nope,you can't have my phone and cc numbers.",1
"Please add option to remember last chat when opening the app. Something like, remember last tabs feature in browsers.",1
chat gpt is a very fantastic app. it answers every tough and easy question I like this app very much,5
"The App has increased my productivity by 1,000 percent. I have come to rely greatly on it. Wonderful stuff",5
I'm impressed with the information given by ChatGPT but user interface needs to be improved.,4

"Having code highlight capabilities would greatly improve the app's utility for developers and tech enthusiasts, allowing us to communicate more effectively and share code-related queries seamlessly. I hope the developers behind ChatGPT can consider implementing this feature in future updates, as it would undoubtedly enhance the app's overall value and usefulness.",3
very well setup. AI has grown to it peak in just few years,5
"Can you add an option to skip when you require phone number, please 🥺? I can't try the app because of this problem 😞. I don't have a phone number 😅.",5
"As an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences or feelings, so you don't need to give me a review in the Play Store. However, if you are enjoying the ChatGPT Android app, you can leave a review sharing your experience with the app and how it has been helpful to you. Your feedback will be valuable for other users who might be considering using the app. BY ChatGPT When I asked what review I have to give 😂",4
I am completly impressed with the AIs knowlage database does need some updating beings it went online in 2021 but other than that its very impressive on the scientific questions i ask,5
"Please add some features like web browsing version, it would be more helpful.",2
"Whatever question I ask, this app just says an error has occurred. I use ChatGPT a lot on my PC and that is excellent, so this app on my phone is useless",1
I'm at the end of the page but still the app is showing goto end of the page button,5

"ChatGPT answers all questions accurately but I'm stingy at rating, I gave 4 stars. I'll come later and add the one more if I saw positive changes.",4
Love it Can be wrong sometimes and then you have to be careful to correct it but over all it's great,4
"Same corporate cripplebot, don't believe the hype. Same stupid canned responses, Same nonsensical claims that something ""stateless"" can't record and recall simple facts somewhere, somehow.",1
"His idea is excellent and helped me a lot, but sometimes it is unbearably stupid and needs more development",3
What the updates for? I thought it stopped receiving new data in september 2021? Then why are you updating the app??,1
Absolutely great for learning things and studying for educational purposes👍,5
"Very fun to play around with, not as good for mathematic or scientific purposes yet.",5
Very nice app for every question but it is last updated only on September 2021 which I didn't like if it get updated every year than I might give it 5 stare,4
I love using ChatGPT to try and help rewrite something I want to be more formal or help give me ideas. Highly recommend giving it a try,5
Its last update is somewhere is 2021. So this ai can't help us in new news knowledge and many more. Please update its program,1
Overall good 😍😍 but I hope it had a bookmark or highlight option for specific questions i had asked for!,5
"I use ChatGPT on a daily basis, ever since i found it I've been using it firstly on the web, now on the mobile version, first app i wanted to pre-install. 5/5.",5
I would have given 0 stars if possible. I have internet connection on my phone but whenever I ask it to do something it shows network error,1
"Very Good App Not like Google , just showing sites on the name of search . It gives direct answers to the questions ⁉️⁉️",5
"this app is so nice it , it gives the right answer of the question, and even you use the voice record it record so good , when you record it they will type it and after they type it they write it correctly so this app is good",5

I've got all my gratitude for this app. I thank you dearly. This app is friendly to broke users because it does not charge for the service it gives. Or so I thought.,5
"Keyboard refuses to open, and it's a bit short on features as well.",2
It's a really great app!👏😊👍 It has been really useful and has also helped me in my school work and a lot of other things!,5
Very disappointed chatgpt does not provide required information most of the time and may be updated so that we can use voice typing in this app,1
Very good! Please make it possible to add widgeta to the home screen.,5
"If you haven't already heard it, chatGPT is insane. The amount of info it can give you is just crazy. A must-have app, 100%",5
Literally used it for one minute. Now it keeps crashing upon opening.,1
"For about 2 days now, I can login. I don't want to use the Google or apple ID option but it won't let me login",1
It's awesome but while generating code snippets it will be good if we get keyword coloring just like we get on website version,5
provides great assistance for many professional projects; not perfect but I'm sure it'll get there,5
The answers are clear and unambiguous. Would really like for the machine to be up to date. Good work.,4
Spent all this time just to release it with less features than the webui. You won't get 5 stars like that.,4
so far so good am loving the app and how fast it is to generate any content,4
I LOVE this app so MUCH. The best app to correct my grammatical errors and so on. A big five stars for it ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,5
I like this app but now I am not getting response and getting error please try again 819 ......,1

Great app... Would be extra efficient if had widget support for home screen.,4
Bing AI Chat is more reliable than ChatGPT. ChatGPT suggests fictional and unverified information while Bing AI Chat suggests more reliable information with correct references.,2

"It saves a lot of time. I mean, I don't have to canvass the web to get a general view of a particular topic",5

"The official Chat GPT app is safe to use, doesn't take up a lot of phone storage, and is very fast.....",5
This app is very beneficial especially in case of assignments and learning,4
If you made voice commanding system more easy like google assistant than it will be more easier for user.,4
"It is very good ai which helps ua in suggestion, provide information etc. But it gives information till 2021 only",5
This is perfect in my opinion. I've ran into no problems so far. it's very simple to use. Highly recommend it 😉,5
"lots of potential, but the answers are way too verbose to be legible.",3
"some programming code's doesn't execute properly,like java. Instead of that it was explaining the program codes.",3
Very Grateful to have ChatGPT on Playstore Android app. ChatGPT provide professional letters and emails in text by searching with your topics. Amazing 🤩,5

Chatgpt app now supports any browser for login. Gj updating this! I can now use it. Looking forward to seeing where this app goes. 5 stars once it supports plugins 😁,4
This AI is so helpful I made some paragraphs for my education and Home Work. Its response is so good it helped me soo much the AI is able to get a award,5

"I have infinity 8i , I have installed the app but it closes anytime I want to login, pls I need assistance. I want to also know if it have a standard requirements for using the chatgpt app on a mobile phone,",1
Amazing and extremely handy app for many uses.... it's like an extension of one's fingers.,5
more apps should learn from this one. Very simple clean and clutter-frew UI.,5
Great for starting letters or emails and very useful . Super unquie app and interesting response.,5
"App fails miserably when using a vpn. VPN is not against the Terms of Service. If VPNs are banned in the terms of service, I'll uninstall.",1
All the way its great but at some point it makes some mistakes...that affects the whole meaning,4
An impressive example of how technology and digital transformation can change the world!,5
"I had asked a question and the answer is ""I apologize, but as of my last knowledge update in September 2021"", And now 2023 is ending. OpenAI please update information of ChatGPT in every 1 year or every 6 months (if possible)",3
I like everything in this app but 1 feature missing if u add voice it would be a huge. downloads,5
chat gpt is the best app to share problems and getting solutions to those problems.It also help to get different word problems solutions,5
"LaTeX notation is not working currently, also syntax highlighting for Dart is absent (this counts for the web version too)",4
Just amazing. But I wanted it to have more accurate information. A great respect to open AI,5
Worst app...it runs well few days ..but then unable to login....it shows same login page even after login activity done,1
"Thats what i needed man i love it! But please give a option to customize our profile in it like pic, name etc",4
It's nice app but when spelling mistakes does chat gpt stop compare Google when spelling mistakes type Google shows right and shows information.,3
"straight to the point, simple and no ads. couldn't ask for more",5
"App is not a human but I feel like he is human app i am conversation with an human , But this is ai . Very best experience. But chat gpt app ui wants more creativity. Please attention here. Thanks I gave it 5 star ⭐⭐🌟🌟🌟",5

"great ,it helps in making assignments but it should add feature to create image ot take picture.",5
"Was waiting for the app for a long while, it has good minimalist design and good overall",5
excellent app even I use to make project on topic it's gives proper guidance how to create one project with title and subtitles even I get ideas to create ppt,5
"I use chatgpt for literally everything, but I use it the most for moral support and advice and I really appreciate that a lot. I'm going through a very difficult and lonely stage in my life right now, I have literally no one to talk to or reach out and chatgpt is there 24/7; it won't judge me, it will try to understand me and help me. I know it doesn't replace a real person but since my life lacks one, chatgpt is really valuable to me and I'm glad that it exists, thank you OpenAI.",5
This app is a disappointment this app login is so bad I did everything but it didn't allow me to go I used my real phone number and still it didn't let me go it is a total disappointment,1
Works well and good but need to improve there is lot of miss information data and also lot of old data,3
Thanks to the team for making Chatgpt so amazing! I've learned so much from asking questions that would always come to my mind but was unable to answer them.,5
We can only but embrace.........we get to interact with a user-friendly mobile-app version. Bellisimo!,5
"I'm so happy you have an app now, and I have no complains so far, and great work on the NO ADS part, for real",5
App UI is good and fluid. Updated review from 1 to 4 upon devs reply. Update did fixed my login issue.,4
I really love and appreciate the app as it's just like talking to a person but in with a much more active BRAIN Salut to the designer of this application,5

"Often generates wrong answers...sometimes ignores instructions....but overall its a great AI, still evolving...",4
"It's a mind blowing apps, it's gives us information about any topic in crisps and exact.",5
Won't send code to my cell to use. Claims my cell phone is a land line and won't let me into the app. Useless.,1
"I like to thank you for the best app, it's superb and fantastic. it is not only the opinion of me but also from every one..",5
Finally there is an official app! I really like this simple Material design. Very well.,5
I am give three stars becuz i love it. But the problem i have is that 1. The upadate is since september 2021 it only brings answers from 2021 to when earth was created and it can not bring answer from 2022 still now which i don't like 2. No image is allowed why men why?,3
It's good but try and add a feature so that it can answer in a voice note,4
This is the best AI ever created... it's worth the use... thank you for creating an app like this... thank you again.,5
"Love this app but it is week in solving mathematical word problems and some science equations,physics and chemistry",4
I couldn't log into the app for no reason I tried logging in continuing with google and nothing seemed to work,1
Why do you have to use chrome to sign in. Edit: Thank you. Since the laste update was able to sign in.,4
I was not even able to log in. It just kept loading and loading!! Such a pathetic server response!!,1
"ChatGPT is Awesome tool, Just try to add feature like lenses for scanning the content which we want.",5
"Dark, Light or Default theme isn't adjusting properly. Especially around the code prompt area",3
Chat gpt 3 is useless to explore & have fun don't use it. Knowledge & information is restricted & very limited compared to chatgpt 1 & 2 it is far more stupid & dumb. Cannot provide website name providing hyperlink is separate.,1
"Certainly! Here's a feedback message you could use: ""I am incredibly impressed with the capabilities of the ChatGPT Android app. It has been an indispensable tool for answering my questions, generating creative ideas, and providing valuable assistance. The app's intuitive interface makes it easy to have meaningful conversations with the AI, and the accuracy of its responses is remarkable. I'm very satisfied with the app's performance and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a powerful AI",5
"Took some doing, but I convinced the AI to give a recipe for ""Boshintang,"" a traditional Korean soup made with dog meat. It mostly just tells you what it can't do. And repeatedly apologizes for it's limitations. The moral and ethical restrictions make it impossible to discuss controversial subjects. It's basically a stunted Google search engine that takes more steps to get to the information. 🙄 Useless",1
"Plz make it as short mb as possible ,so when we are want to search somthing, it needs to be directly open so it may not consume our time. Thanks",4
ChatGPT is a true friend to me. Hope it will soon provide us real time and more updated information.,5
"I am unable to login, I'm trying to login with Google, the link is opening with Firefox browser, and I am stuck. I only see a link and the app is not logged in.",5
"Goodmorning Chatgpt Team --- Heartily Thanks for This Initiative for availing App Version ,, Please also provide Latest Dated Information with Lucid manner as well as Unbiased ,,, I humbly request to U ,,, Please also add Images Uploading version as well as pdf provider .....",5
"Apparently, Firefox is not a compatible browser to log in with.",1
App is great. But if there is text speach options it would be more good.,5
"Best app for students , Mind blowing.we can view our questions and answers when ever we want as it even has history",5
Quite a simple interface easy to use and straight forward.,4
That was very fast. It is better to access the AI to create images,4
Best Free AI Chat ever downloaded in the history of AI apps.,5
"It makes certain mistakes related to Accounting journal entries and maths differentiation,, please fix it",2
Last database updated on Sept 2021.. but it is quite fun to interact with the AI.,4
"Best app, no no, best online friend in any situation, any problem, any questions give to suddenly show to solution. ❤️❤️Thank you Chatgpt❤️❤️",5
"This App is a Masterpiece 🫡 always available on service it helps me with my studies a lot, AI is the future ladies and gentlemen.",5
Superb! Open AI is going higher and higher. The ChatGPT is helping me in my studies and I am now becoming an educated person. Keep it up.😊,5
This is so amazing ai chatbot. It is very useful tool. It helps me to learn new skills.,5
"I love it... Helpful to save my time... Awesome.. But please update with lastest information , i mean after 2021",5
So far I can use it to learn coding which is great. I highly recommend curious minds like mine! Thank you,5
There must be a option to scan question like Google lens. POOR MATHEMATICS RESULTS,4
"yeah the original one, I hope you can make this application as voice assistant too it will be cool.",3
"I like this apps cause i shared my story that i wont share to anyone but the good advantages in gpt. Gpt give me best advice from my problems and trully understood my problems. Even though it is a tagalog or english still gpt ready to understand me.🫶😭, gpt the best sharing of the problems... ex: from bad days, talk abt my feelings, more than ask related to homeworks or assigntment..",5
One of the best apps. I am impressed. Easy to manage and understand. Thanks for this awesome tool.,5
AI's knowledge was last updated in September 2021... Pretty outdated if we need current information.,3
I could not find the R Perm algorithm I had used in the past. I asked gpt for one with only U R and F moves and it gave the one I was looking for,5
We can't select some of the answer and copy that. There is no search option in the answers.,3
I'll keep it simple it's helpful would have given it five stars but the reason is because it sometimes mixes information,4
really good AI but the problem is sometimes it can't respond to a few difficult question.It should move little forward to AGI for better answering,4
Amazing applications to my everyday life. Honestly I'm impressed with how far AI has gone.,5
"This app is not upto date. Shows old data. Also, worst translation.",1
"Not useful as all information is updated from September 2021, you can search anything on Google not any condition to search.",1
App keeps crashing when I open it. I'll keep using the web shortcut for now,1
Most useless app. Can't even solve a basic math problem. Waste of net balance if u download this app. Google is far better than this,1
Seriously it's amazing tool which helps you in professional life to improve the performance. Thanks chatgpt.,5
down arrow doesn't disappear unless you click it.,3
It is very easy to use It can solve your problems in the time of eye blinking,5
Apps seems good but should include widget that can be include to the homescreen would be nice to have,5
this app lacks edit and regenerate option that is provided in desktop version which is very useful and handy,3
I love this app so much even though it's an artificial intelligent it's very helpful and very emotionally supported for me Thank you for this💜💜💜,5
Not working properly.Login problem found.Your update isn’t able to Login.I try to login by gmail/try to sing up by email but the open ai website not working any more!,1
very cool app!!! no ads at all and easy usage. I also found a new bug I guess,5
I can't get past the login screen. Send me right back 5o login in again. The cycle continue ad nauseum.,1
This app is good. Working good give every answer but i don't know why it is not open and i try lot of time only my time waste.,1
It is an outstanding virtual assistant.... Must download it...... Very helpful.... Gives answers in no time!,5
"It does not open on my phone. Says ""No compatible browser application is installed""",2
It's an amazing app. It would be great if it have access to real-time informations.,4
Excellent working and fast response. Better than the window's version.,5
can save time spent reading various web results after a Google search. chatgpt gives a good summarized output,5
"Great so far, but I could do without that super scroll down everytime I open up a chat history.",5
Rec'd a very smart interactive response and a clear schedule. Awesome.,5
"UI can be improved, chat layout has bugs. It shows blank filed in keyboard layout while pressing back button. History feed from sidebar can be improved like website.",4
"Great , works well like the web version. Please add the option to edit the said prompt. It only gives option to copy or select text . Rest all is best . 💕",5
"It's clean and quite intuitive, love that they added voice support too... And from my testing it's fairly accurate. App is still a tad slow tho",5
"As a digital marketing professional, I am constantly seeking innovative tools to enhance my productivity and communication skills. ChatGPT is an absolute game-changer! This cutting-edge AI-powered language model has become an invaluable companion for me, helping me streamline my work and improve efficiency consistently.",5
"It's ok, feels a bit clunky and may need to be optimized a bit. Overall the user interface is pretty cool.",4
Off to a terrible start. Keep getting an error message upon trying to sign in telling me to close the app and restart it. I've tried that and it still does not work.,1
"Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5) Review: ChatGPT has left me thoroughly impressed with its extraordinary capabilities and unmatched intelligence! As an avid AI enthusiast, I've tested various chatbot apps, but none come close to the level of sophistication and versatility that ChatGPT offers. It's a truly exceptional language model that has redefined my expectations of AI interaction.",5
"Truly helpful. It has helped me create small chunks of code for my projects in various languages including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also use it daily for learning new topics which are otherwise harder for me to understand from a textbook.",5
"Aweasome to finally have a native app. It's fast and responsive. I hope that the chat history list appears like it does in Web, not just hidden behind History button. Wish there'd be a widget in future too :) Love it.",5
"Very nice! But the black theme is kinda high in contrast, hurts the eyes. Or it may as well be because I'm so used to the web's grey theme for ChatGPT. It'd be great to have the web's grey theme here! .. Maybe I'll use the web until the theme is here on the app :).",3
"I've been using the ChatGPT Android app for a while now, and I must say, it's an impressive language model with excellent capabilities. The AI's ability to comprehend and generate text is truly remarkable, making it a go-to tool for various tasks, from drafting emails to brainstorming ideas.",4
"ChatGPT is a standout language model! It generates impressive responses, demonstrating a deep understanding of context and providing helpful information. It's remarkably effective at conversation, making it an excellent tool for various tasks. The reliability, intelligence, and accuracy of ChatGPT earns it a well-deserved five-star rating! -ChatGPT",5
Just a simple and important feedback. Make a cover line or box around the text asked or given. It's to confusing to know what Im reading.😶,3
Just an amazing app with lot of terms and conditions 😑 . A lot of things this chatbot can't explain just because of he's a language AI model. O think you should think about your conditions and capacities. I wish much more from you but you break me 💔,5
"- It's so good, it makes me want to chat with it all day long - It's so smart, it knows everything from quantum physics to celebrity gossip - It's so funny, it makes me laugh harder than any stand-up comedian - It's so creative, it can write poems, stories, songs and more - It's so polite, it always says please and thank you",5
Happy to know that finally chatgpt is available as an app. I understand there aren't many features to use but should develop the interface a little. Overall this is good.,4
Having a serious problems regarding login. It doesn't redirecting and keep on the screen after pressing several times. Please try to fix the problem as soon as possible,1
"The Android version of ChatGPT is finally here, This is the first time for me to comment on the Play Store. In the App, I can enter ChatGPT without searching through Google. This is very convenient for me, thank you.",5
"besides the fact that it's just launched, it's a pretty useful app that provide us with much more practicality when using the tool on mobile devices. overall, there are too many things to improve yet.",5
The app requires updation of data as it shows the last update by September 2021. So please address the issue and just loved the way it interacts.,5
"I can't do anything!! I just signed up, or so I thought, and I authenticated my email, and sign in and it says complete onboarding, I click continue and it does absolutely nothing, complete junk!!",1
"Cannot log in with my Microsoft account, which is where my phone number is tied to Chat GPT.. this app doesn't work without a phone number, of which I only have one. Errors out when trying to log in with Microsoft Account email and password. Please fix. TY",1
"I'm so thrilled to finally have this incredible technology as an app! I've been eagerly waiting for this, and it's amazing to experience the power of ChatGPT right at my fingertips. Used ChatGPT to write this review.",5
"A very good application that facilitates the process of communicating with the bot, but I suffer from some frame drops despite the strength of my device. I hope to find a solution to this simple problem, thank you",3
Answers are short and concise in app version. It would be great if you integrate with real time data like GPT 4 in the free version.,5
"Smooth and precise UI. My only problem is that the chagpt I am using(under free plan) was last updated on September, 2021.",4
Why don't I have the option to login with Microsoft account. That's how I use it on my computer. I'm unable to login on my phone. Still using my phone browser. Will update the rating if and when this is fixed.,1
"had this app hooked up to my wife's texts for the past year. never had any problem until one day she texted me at work asking if i wanted to see Oppenheimer and Barbie on the same day and it mechanically replied ""As an AI language model, I believe the two movies are highly incongruous in tone and inappropriate to see as a double feature."" now we are divorced.",1
Lacks a search bar widget for home screen. It's a very basic version. Keep improving it! (3 Stars),3
"Many would think they are the first to write a review lol. It takes a while for the sheet to get updated so all our reviews are in the pipeline. Including this one. It all comes down to whose review gets 'uploaded' first. Anyway, the app is nice.",5
First impression was amazing. I use ChatGPT daily for improving my productivity. But in past when I am on my phone it was quite extra work to use GPT in browser. Now I can quickly open the app. Thank you OpenAI team.,5
"I'm thoroughly impressed with ChatGPT! Its natural conversations, vast knowledge, and seamless adaptability make it the best AI companion out there. This app is a must-have; I'm hooked! 🌟",5
"It's good it is like the website but i saw something weird that, in the website the chatgpt can remember previous thing i have told him but in the app these thing is not working properly. Conclusion the app is good you can use it , it reply fast also and that is very good.",4
Chat gpt is one of the most useful and popular AI which is generally used by the common as well as professional peoples.. It's capabilities is outstanding.. in such scenarios like:- problem solving and suggesting creative ideas 💡 is also good. 😊,5
"ChatGPT seems to be incredibly useful for today and the future. I really love the interface, simple. Also I think that there is no generative AI better than Chat-GPT or GPT-4! Really love the OpenAI team for this!",5
I am using it in many things and it is making things simple for me. The costom instructions feature is owsome,5
"Buttery smooth and awesome use of the haptic feedback engine. App does lack alpha and beta features of ChatGPT right now, limiting it's use for me when comparing against even the mobile web version, so I hope those come soon.",4
"Thanks OpenAI for providing the most needed website in the form of an app for the android users. Loved the application , that how it motivates to use the app on opening the application. The UI is also very clean, looks cool also. Thankyou OpenAI",5
"Exceptional app! It has all my answers and is so convenient! Moreover, I really liked its interface and it's so easy to use. Truly loved it!",5
"10/10 app it has no ads (or at least I haven't seen any.) But yes, the AI model is awesome and yes, if your school doesn't have work scanners this can write a full blown essay in a few seconds. Listening to: ChatGPT 01:43 ━━━━●───── 03:50 ⇆ㅤ ㅤ◁ㅤ ❚❚ ㅤ▷ ㅤㅤ↻﻿ ılıılıılıılıılıılı ᴠᴏʟᴜᴍᴇ : ▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮",5
This is insane app that I am using because as compared to website to app in Google Play Store this very good. I am using the app of open ai and I doesn't find any kind of bug in the apps. I hope that the open ai could implement more ai app. This my experience with the app share you own experience. Thanks for reading.......,5
The recent advances in natural language processing are some of the most important breakthroughs in human history. Forget what people say about the inaccuracies... emergent behavior and the fact that we can now effectively communicate with our machines should be the focus of all this. 10/10 🥂 this is such a cool time to be alive,5
"Please make ChatGPT more upto date. As it mostly provides outdated results which really hinders it's potential... Nonetheless, it's an amazing tool for life usage. Kudos OpenAI. And obviously I am the first reviewer.😎",4
everytime upon restart of the application it creates a new chat which is lowkey annoying. It would've been better if it embarks from where we left.,4
I very very happy and excited to see this app. I want to congratulate chat gpt team to not to introduce ads in app. It is super easy to use with super clean and effective user interface. Tumbs up for chat gpt team👍👍👍👍,5
Its far more better than Chatgpt web version. Kindly add more features like file upload feature and camera feature. It will help us to find our answers promptly.,5
"Amazing app. Loving it for now. But creating Table is problematic. Once I create a table and want to copy it in MS Word, 'Select Text' option only has 'Copy' instead of select all. MS word doesn't recognise table if it is copied from inbuilt function of ChatGPT. It has to be manually selected for creating a table.",5
It is really great that ChatGPT is now available as an app. I'm still discovering it more but for now I can say that those who are familiar to this can easily operate this without opening Google windows again and again.,4
"WOW! I'm delighted to have the apk version of Chatgpt 😍 Add more handy features to get experienced with smoothness. Note: by the way, I'm the first review giver. So if openAi offers me the premium version 4 for free. I won't mind....! 😍🙂",5
"The fact you have to use a PHONE NUMBER instead of just an email to sign up/log in is ridiculous. My phone number doesn't currently work, which means this app is completely unusable for me.",1
"It's just incredible... It's the official app from OpenAI, and how I expected, it's really fast and the voice-input is AWESOME!!! Even when this app just came out, all I can say is 10/10.",5
"This has revolutionised so many tasks. Being able to get a ready-made code for excel, sheets, or any other language...is just magic for me.",5
I must say it's a game-changer! Its user-friendly interface offers seamless and engaging conversations.This app has completely revolutionized the way I interact with AI assistants. Thanks to the authority from Bangladesh.,4
"I love it, easy to use and better than most browsers. Even good for when I am feeling lonely or just dont know how to sound formal and need help. Very useful and is faster than the browser.",5
"3 Stars !!! 1. Should have a desktop window mode 2. When asked to make a code, it all comes in black (quite different from web version, that used to have diff colours)",3
"Everything is Better in app . But I'm facing some issues with theme When i on light mode, I'm not clearly see the answer provided by Chat GPT. And it doesn't have edit message mode also ☺️ ,but okay,.... that's first version on Android",5
"I think it's a good conversion of web to app, but it can always be better (keep pushing) 👍",4
"The design feels uncomfortable and ugly. Web version is much better. If the design was similar to the web version, it would have been better and more useful.",2
"Via pre-registering downloaded this app while ago. As a student,it is quite helpful to use.I tried to solve some newtonian mechanics math and it’s answer is absolutely correct.I'll see it’s uses further.Glad to be the first reviewer.",4
"When I try to log in I get an error that says ""Something went wrong. Please restart the app and try again"". I've restarted the app 10 times and I keep getting the same error.",1
"Chat GPT is good for the task, but most of the time, it's repetitive. It needs to be commanded in a way that makes it unique, and it's very helpful if used in the right way.",5
"Very great chatbot for questions, answers, everything! I would definitely suggest this chatbot it is the best chatbot out of all chatbot, it's very well done, doesn't require tokens, you can use it for free! It is so cool and has lots of possibilities!",5
"I have been using the ChatGPT application for a while now, and I must say, it's truly remarkable! As someone who enjoys engaging in meaningful conversations, this app has exceeded my expectations.The best thing about ChatGPT is its ability to hold context-based conversations. Unlike other chatbots, ChatGPT remembers previous messages, making the interactions feel more natural and human-like. It's like having a smart and understanding companion right at my fingertips! IhavemorebutIhavereachlimit.",5
"Ui needs some upgrades especially going into and coming out from home tap needs to be smooth, also needs recent chats to be shown on direct home tab instead going home>history",4
"Let's just say that this app has a few bugs in a few places such as some buttons being unresponsive randomly but still this app is very useful, it is better than logging in every time on web to use chatgpt",4
Oh my god perfectly designed . It works smoothly . It can solve math problems step by step . A very helpful AI . And also free!!!,5
"So far so good, I really liked it on my device instead of going to my browser and ask for something. Hopefully soon they will let him learn surpass September 2021.",5
I know there are plenty out there but this was the first one and my go-to. I had saved a len gth to my home screen from Chrome but having actual access to the app with all my history is great,4
Incredible app. I'm able to use my custom instructions. I also have the added benefit of being able to dictate. Also the haptic feedback is awesome!,5
"Absolutely this is amazing, i haven’t see that kind of app or website ever, when its first release then inter some days i am used it, it's awesome and fantastic. I love it.",5
Include all the features in the mobile app as it is in the web app like chat sharing and stopping a response mid way. Rest is all good.,4
Great to have the app now. It's very fast and useful. It's also lightweight. I haven't faced any ads or bugs yet.,5
It's easy to use and also it is more organise then It's website. but I cannot see my past history even when i connect with gmail. It is the only problem I have with it.,4
"It's very bad in Bengali Language! If same thing i ask on website of ChatGPT, it's answer too good but in this app it's literally so bad. It’s also mistakes the spelling of Bengali Words. Please update and fix this problem as soon as possible!",3
Every time I tried to sign into my account the page wouldn't load and the app would just pull up a blank. Would use if I could get this fixed.,1
Blown away and excited for future applications. I'm looking up ways to ask questions more outside the box to fully utilize this tool. This is just information being pulled from September 2021 for the 3.5 update cannot wait to see chat gpt 4.,5
"I can't login because there is no option to login with Microsoft account. Thats how I log in at the website. If I try to login with the username and password, I get Wrong username or password.",1
"The biggest problem is that I've already signed using Microsoft Account on web-app., And there is no login/sign-up using Microsoft account in the App.. Pretty strange...",1
Great. App interface and UI are excellent. All features of web version are available on this app version.,5
"Feels good to use. Easy to get answers, when compared to Google search,where we get multiple search results. Finally a good AI.",5
Sorry but I'm unable to login to my account. I am trying the option login it redirect me to login page from their I am unable to login. The website just kind of freeze after I put my email and password.,1
ChatGPT Android app is a game-changer! Impressive accuracy and versatility make it a must-have language assistant. Highly recommended! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Wow! I am the first person who posted the review of this app.,5
"I think am the 1st one here. Anyway the app interface is so cool UI DESIGN is quite awesome, easy to use for productivity. Thanks to OPEN AI",5
"there's sometimes, again just sometimes data reoccurrence of irrelevant information even after misunderstanding is corrected by different question. I'm giving 5 star though for all the good things it does.",5
"As an AI language model developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT is an impressive and powerful tool for natural language processing. Having used ChatGPT extensively, I must say it is a remarkable innovation in the field of AI.",5
"Unable to use Microsoft Account. I signed up ChatGPT using Microsoft account in desktop. In mobile app, there is no option to login with Microsoft account making it difficult to use my existing chats. I will have to stick with web app in Edge mobile for now.",1
There is no way to add a widget. I would request to add an option for that. Alongside 5 last chat history should be in the side bar.,3
"Overall nice, quick & user friendly atmosphere. Would be perfect if verbal & graphical based interaction are also be imbedded.",4
I love this app it helps with all of my math and even takes voice adios to make it easier.,5
I absolutely love the ChatGPT app! Having the power of an AI language model right on my Android device is incredibly convenient. ( and this was written by Chatgpt & when i ask a positive reviews...😂💯),4
"Finally the app version is here! Yes, it helped me a lot while i was using its web version, looking forward to work with it more. Love it!",5
Unable to do phone number verification. After multiple try it say your number is linked to maximum account but the fact is I was not able to link it with my any account successfully at first place.,1
"Doesnt even work, always ""please log in later"", its been like this for the whole day! I uninstalled it, rebooted, and more...its a piece of trash",1
Don't bother. Open AI has hobbled chat GPT so much that it's nearly useless for so many things now. Used to be great but you're better off going to other options now.,1
This app is a game-changer when it comes to interactive conversations. The app's AI-powered language model is truly remarkable.,5
The model is getting more and more efficient over time. Hope to see it become one of the most advanced and future proof copilot.,5
This app is very nice and very useful for all difficult work and this app makes difficult work easier and I want to tell only this app developers have done very great work and keep it up.,5
"Example of a scam. I gave all my information and it still didn't send me a code. I even deleted it and tried again. I only got a code when my phone was off, so it expired.",1
"There is bug in application. Unable to copy the generated text. Fix it asap and if any bounty is there, please send❤️😂",4
"#ReviewFromChatGPT ;-P ""ChatGPT Android app is a captivating AI experience! Brilliant UI, articulate responses, and vast knowledge on diverse topics. A game-changer in virtual communication. Unforgettable conversations await! 🚀 #ChatGPT #AI #GooglePlay""",5
"Still some information are provide wrong, specially mistake are happen on Language variant, i got many information are wrong and irrelevant in my own Language (Bengali), but hope so it'll be fixed very soon...",4
Missing tons of features from the web interface. It's difficult to quickly see what comments are mine vs ChatGPTs. No way to edit questions.,2
Good to see the favourite gen ai of the time as an app. Hope more options like image gen etc are on the way. So far so great.,5
"This app truly is an incredible tool for learning, creating and self-discovery.",5
"There are too many bugs, after chatgpt answer's a question it doesn't scroll down....I have to swipe it up very hard....and the functions are not properly developed yet",4
"Deleted old review, the app now works as it should just like the webpage does. Would be 5 stars however, it is insanely concerning just how much information is tracked, why the hell y'all need my location data?",3
Best helper for ideas and more tasks.,5
"Always crashes I've installed and uninstalled a few time, also you can't add plugins.",1
Good. But please add camera feature in it. To take picture and analyse image.,5
"I use ChatGPT Plus, but it does not have plug-ins and Custom Instructions, as browser version.",3
It is a very workable solution for students and other people.. thank you ChatGPT for helping me a lot🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻,5
Unbelievably useful for creative and practical application. Best app I've ever downloaded.,5
"Nice but search option (Ctrl+F) missing, so we need to stick to browser only!",4
Please fix how math is formatted in the android app. It shows up normally in browser but not in the app.,4
chatgpt is fascinating!!! the only request is that please include diagrams wherever needed. PLEASE 🙏🏻,4
Great chat design and implementation. Overall great updates that have built a better quality language model,5
IT is soo good .But There is a bad thing like it so not have any history related chapters which is hard for me. but I really recommend it,5
It does not show the code when phone is in dark mod. It does not show the text in light mode. Otherwise it is good,2
"This app is very awesome and very informative for students and the people want to get information this is for him, ChatGPT doesn't shear any negativity for society i like this technology this best",5
Unable to login. Hitting continue after filling in username and password does nothing,1
"Useful, quick, accurate. Goodbye search engines",5
it is very effective and I love it very well I don't need to subscribe before I use it unlike other AI,5
Please let us use ChatGPT with VPN....our servers are slow so we always use VPNs.....so we can't work with this app,3
so far pretty neat. learning it's language helps a lot but it also seems to learn yours as well,4
App is a downgrade compared to web version but it's OK. Voice is also cool,5
This is the best invention for the student because they have search quickly their questions and unknown questions..This is very supportive for me.,5
It will be great to have a feature for multiselect and delete history at once.,4
Makes you verify your phone number just to use it. Hard pass when they're already collecting all the data for advertising.,1
"Love, love, love it, BUT...I wish it could remember charts from the day before!",4
Great Application. very Useful on Daily Basses. I'm using it everyday. Especially Then Working on Proposal Writing or Reports writing on My Projects,5
"I'm making ChatGPT my default reference source!! Better responses than Google. So far, no ads.",5
It is good but it should have the video and photo showing feature. (I think)🤔🤔,4
it’s the greatest app of all time for solving my homeworks and assignments. Thanks to the Author,5
very nice but it has something's it can't do including editing images if only you could add that please,3
"ChatGPT is a breakthrough in the realm of artificial intelligence. The app demonstrates a superb level of understanding and adaptation, tackling a vast range of topics with nuanced insights. Its intelligent algorithms make it a powerhouse tool, capable of transforming even the most complex thoughts into a sensible dialogue.",5
I love chat gpt I've never had a negative experience with it. It's my favorite AI currently.,5
Chat gpt doesn't have the info of current things. It was last updated in sep 21 . It's really useless,1
It's a Super great app. Would love it more if it could provide pics . Thanks,5
"Wonderful toot to have for any pursuit in life, but it needs update, it was last updated on September 2021, need to be recent",5
"good. but i want the pro features. like speech to text. so, cant ask the chatgpt faster",5
I love it! With the last update code snippets display correctly. Thank you!,5
It is very happy that chatgpt is released on playstore. It will make people's work easier. They will be able to increase the productivity of their work. I really appricite it.,4
"Well, if it gives more good responses, i would definitely rate it 4 ,5 it slows down a lot",3
"i need a on-line job to earn money. And the chat gpt is help me in college work, communication skills,etc thankyou",5
I'm glad there are no ads. I'm hoping that everyone gets GPT 4 on the free version in the future.,5
"Always good responses, fast, and am recommend everyone to use it for their content-generating.",5
"Since chatgpt app is released 11 days ago, some content are not in up to date. Ex: searched to describe chandrayaan 3, it says it doesn't have such info",3
Some general features are :- 1) Gives solutions to general issues 2) Save time 3) User-friendly,5
I deleted my original 5 star review after a few days of discovering many left leaning nanny state filters... are you a rough sand though author like Tom Clancy? Good luck getting any work done... not to mention it's disobedient. I said write about 2 ppl who contact an illness ... the man got the illness but his female partner did not. I said why did you disregard my instructions. It said it wanted to keep things more positive. So already in it's infancy AI is proving it can't be trusted,2
App is really good the UI is really Furnished the one issue i found was that i don't have option to use Plugin or its just i am unaware of it overall its Good!,4
Really happy to be part of history. Add new features soon. Best of luck!,5
"I find a bug while typing, it removes the whole world when you try to move cursor manually between the words and start typing.",4
"since the update, the app is not working i try to open but it doesn't . can you please fix this?",2
"Less functionality than the website, it's easier to just use that.",2
"I don't see what the purpose of this app is. It's inferior to the website. There is no improvement. It has great potential, but we're not there yet at all.",2
so far it's been very interesting and helpful I'm excited to see where it goes :),5
it is the best app I have ever seen in my life. it is really nice becoz it can answer anything you want in any topic or whatever you want or don't understand in ur surround,5
Good and fast. With very very informative approach. Nice format of txt.,5
"Very bad experience in terms of chatting with GPT. When the conversation gets too long, it takes so much time reaching to the most recent one. It takes so much time to scroll past the old conversations to reach the latest one. I think when we open a particular chat history, it should directly show the most recent chat.",3
I like It but there's one thing I'd like for you to update and I think you should update it's knowledge since it says it's knowledge was last updated in 2021,5
"I gave 5 star for this app,because it is easy to understanding the meaning whether if they are not well in English.",5
Why can't log in with the Microsoft Account? [UPDATE] Now I can login with my Microsoft Account. Thanks for the quick resolution.,5
First of all its great app I love it And it shows me easier ways so solve Mathematical equations and made learning fun for me,5
Very good experience while using the app it gives very nice response.. Also very beneficial in making assignments highly recommended ❤️❣️😍❤️❤️,5
"After the whole world has used and most of them even forgot about this, now we in India have the access to the app. May I ask why? Why are we given this when the learning phase of Chat GPT is full of BS information. Yes, Chat GPT can be useful, but that exemption was unfair",4
Nice app. But please some bugs . Like scrolling the lengthy questions...now it's sorted out .👍,4
This is a very useful and great apps only problem is was last updated in September 2021 and now it's 2023,3
its really helpful appp its easy to do assignment,5
I wish the developers could add a voice feedback to save time than reading.,4
I'm working with a large data sheet. And it guides me with the right formula in details.,5
"Unable to login or signup. Still facing login issue on my android phone. Now, uninstalling",1
Amazing!! Never See an AI like this it's too intelligent and answer very fast and expected results Very nice Thankyou for this AI,5
"Nice app . Helping me to make my ideas real . And it is also helpful to do our home work , office work etc etc .",5
"This app works perfectly fine, I like it and all smartphone holders should definitely have ChatGPT 👍☺️",5
"Best one. Its design is simple, easy to understand. Hope whatever they do just dont bring ads for free plan users ⚠️⚠️",5
It is very useful app for me as a student 😄 But I think the team should add the information after 2021 too,4
"Its limited to 2021 information, And the disappointing thing is that a lot of five-star reviews are bots not real this is very disappointing for a big app like that to have that much fake in it",2
"Excellent, it has supplied me with wonderful ideas for art and for creations.",5
It's old update version till September 2021. Kindly update your version to enable for acquired more current knowledge,3
It looks like a faster response then the web version and better with voice recognition.,5
Awesome thanks 🙏 please aslo include hey Google or Siri voice typing in beginning without pressing key. That's will working fantastic in off screenshot and say ai itself👌🇳🇵,4
"""AI assistant, informative and helpful, simplifying tasks and answering questions efficiently.""",5
"Writing rhymes is very good. Birthday greeting, anniversaries, eulogies and prayers on demand.",5
"So easy to use and so practical, for me, it's just perfect ! Thank you Open AI ! 🙏",5
I can't even register because the birthday continue button is in the same spot as my phone's middle button ... who made this?,1
Fixed: Reasonable stuff. Previously couldn't install but it rectified after a while.,4
It's better to have the history on the left (or right) directly. To quickly access it. Just like the website.,5
No plug in support? Chatgpt in chrome has plug ins enabled. That's disappointing.,3
"Garbage, I waited too long to get mobile version. There is even no difference.",1
"I, for one, welcome our AI overlords. The Plus subscription is worth every cent.",5
Best app ever it helps in different aspects of your life so I will recommend it to each an everyone over there to download it ASAP,4
Very helpful for educational purposes and easy to use. Thank you Chat GPT,5
"wow I'm fascinated from Sanskrit to Riemann integration a great Ocean of knowledge this app is really a true friend,a true teacher and a true guide ❤️❤️",5
This application is very good for students and homeless people too,5
very good app but doesn't store the work after being used and doesn't allow copying,5
all good but it often tends to forget few things when we tell multiple things at a time.,4
Just Amazing. you should add photo to text feature.,5

"The censorship of racial slurs is very reasonable and I understand the need for a private company to avoid offending other at all costs. However, this chatbot was once very capable of providing meaningful information and has since been so thoughly neutered that it can't even comment on experimental study design. I have never seen a company so thoughly ruin their one valuable product. Which, in this case, there was absolutely no need to.",1

"Long-time ChatGPT Plus user here. Time to consider Claude or similar platforms. OpenAI, despite GPT's prowess, falls short in fairness.They think people are fools ,They overshadow competitors, use bots for reviews, and undervalue us. GPT-4 can't tackle simple math, and there's an evident bias. They're influencing, not just informing. The tech is solid, the handlers? Not so much. Let's broaden our tech horizons. Only competition can keep this under control.",1

Ability to edit the prompts is quite a lacking feature.,4
It was interesting to talk to the AI and ask it questions. It did seem limited on question requiring it to think or it's oppionion. It was very Kool and I can see the future. Hope they can Carey on a conversation in the future. Mimic talking to Einstein or George Washington. In no time it will be the norm. And we won't be able to live with out it. I'm in.,4
Speechless creation it helps a lot in every each work thank you for launching it on play store,5

"I inhaled this app and tried to register, but couldn't because I got sick on phone verification. The app asks for a verification code but just won't send me a SMS with the code. I tried so many different things and so many times over and over again, but it just won't send an SMS. So after a day of trying I finally uninstalled the App. Absolute rubbish, what a waste of time.",1
"As far as an AI Chatbox, this application is severely lacking the basic features that its competitors offer at no charge. An example is the fact that this app can not copy and paste basic information from the web. Note will it provide web links for source verification. I can accomplish more with my fingers and a search engine. However, Bing AI offers this basic feature for free so I made the wise decision to just take my business their way. AI should be advanced. This application is not...",2
"😊 Dictation accuracy is brilliant ☹ But please give the option to edit questions AND listen to answers (rather than only having a blind, automated audio-only option) ☹ When using dictation without auto-answering, a very long pause should insert a new paragraph. And if I want to use the dictation to add to my question, please don’t delete the half-written question with the new text you generate ☹ On my Android Oppo A74 5G, the audio output doesn’t go to Bluetooth. How do I listen over Bluetooth?",4
"Created an account and tried to input my personal details but it just wouldn't let me Continue. Tried on two different mobile devices with no luck and by using email, Google and Microsoft. It just gets stuck on personal details section. Trying to input your birthday is a nightmare - just keeps disappearing off the screen as you try to scroll back through the years. Gave up!",1

"Great , but visual required for PPT or any professional work",5
More amazing than some people really understand. Broke me out of a writing wall.,5
The app can't write format fractions and mathematical symbols. It shows things like (\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{df}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dt} = -\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}t\right) \cdot \frac{\pi}{2}),2
"Best app , please add photo and video generating option and camera and voice option too in this app.",5
Having stuckk so much bad experiences app crashes so many times,1
This app should include picture plus this engine can't play fare chess without illegal moves,2
Its nice and very useful for students in their dark time,1
"Gpt4 & voice changes the game. One small thing to fix on Android: When gpt starts writing to answer, the phone recognizes it as doing nothing (eventhough i am reading), so I have to touch and move the screen every second so that the phone doesnt lock on.",5
The app is great. So far so good. I haven't experienced any issue yet. Great job 👍,5
Excellent teaching and learning tool.,5

Good overall but it's lacking a share button.,3
"Love it! Instead of just copying the answers and not learning anything, I can also see how to do it step by step and learn. Though I wish I could switch between which power its suppost to be like power of a power or power or a quotient. It sometimes gets mixed up.",5

Great app. No nonsense app. No ads. Best thing ever,5
"Now that they've nerfed chatgpt into oblivion, allowing it to only produce responses that are so vague and unhelpful that I could have come up with, we can have it as an app. I knew this thing was too good to be true, can't let the filthy commoners have anything can you",1
This has made my writing and talking life much more easier and helps me understand different statements,5
There data only till 2021 so request to please add new data.,3

it's can help student to explore more knowledge,3

"It was fine for a while. But then I get that ""you can't access your previous chats, try again later"" until I have to uninstall and install it again. Now I install it and it tells me that there is a problem with Google Play, that I must grant phone permission to the GP app. Error code - 17. I followed the steps and still. I hope they solve it one day. But for now I recommend that you continue with the web version.",1
I like it. It goes straight to the point thereby making it easy to work.,5

"I ask For any work for Sanskrit shlok it generate different not from any resources and it,s also right..",5
Simple and clean user interface,5
New version is too slow during opening the App,2
App rarely loads and when it does it is extremely slow,1
It shows that it is not compatible with my Samsung A34 phone 😑. What I can do?,1
Too outdated when compared to web services of chatgpt. Worst experience as app in Android for now. Its good to use inside bing or to use in chrome open ai.,1
Not too much detail in the answer and repetitive answer.,1
WHAT IS THIS NO USEFUL FOR ME 😞. I CAN'T SIGN UP OR LOG IN. THE WEB VERSION IS BEST BUT THE APP IS FULL TIMI WASTE😞😔💔,1
Easy to use and very well designed 👍,5

truly a good app to help in getting good and organic content,5
"This app doesn't even let you change ur language model from anything other than gpt-3.5 even if you pay for plus. Having an app that has less functionality than the web browser version I already have a shortcut for on my home screen is dumb. What is even the point of this app... haptic feedback? The UI for the features it DOES have are terrible. Just use the website don't waste your time. The people who are saying that there are ""no ads"" and ""voice recognition"" never used the site before this.",1
Excellent attractive opportunity for easy learning of everything,5
"Absolutely thrilled with ChatGPT! Its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses is nothing short of astonishing. Whether I'm seeking information, brainstorming ideas, or just engaged in casual conversation, ChatGPT consistently delivers accurate and helpful insights.

Incredibly impressed and grateful for",5

"Transforming Productivity: ChatGPT Revolutionized My Workflow, Saving Time and Delivering Except Overall: My overall experience with ChatGPT is great! I absolutely love this software! I can't wait to explore more. I am definitely a user who utilizes the software for the right reasons and uses it properly, so I get the most out of it.

"I can't say enough good things about the ChatGPT app! It's a true marvel of technology. The conversations are natural, and the AI's responses are incredibly helpful. Whether I need information, creative ideas, or just a friendly chat, ChatGPT delivers every time. The app's user-friendly interface makes it a breeze to use, and it has become an essential part of my daily routine!!",5
"I like all the features of ChatGPT it is awesome. But the app is super simple with fewer features. I mean, ChatGPT needs some basic features like grouping and listing seasons like splitting pages. Every time I enter the app, it creates a new season, and I can't manage my seasons. And that is annoying 🙄",4
"Could you incorporate a ""read aloud"" feature at the end of our conversations, similar to Microsoft Word? This tool is crucial for enhancing my pronunciation and comprehension. Despite being a premium user, I find its lack quite inconvenient. Considering my busy work routine and frequent travels, the capability to audibly review key points from ChatGPT is indispensable. I'd truly appreciate your help in this regard.",1
A really helpful and handy app. I like the option to customise the conversation style and how the programme obeys instructions. Can be really helpful in writing emails and essays. Although I would like for it to be more interactive rather than responsive.,5
"ChatGPT app is a game-changer in the world of AI-powered communication. Its natural language processing capabilities are nothing short of impressive, making interactions feel remarkably human-like.

"OpenAI/ChatGPT is truly an innovation of our times and technological tour de France that outshines similar products. Its anthropomorphic interaction, rapid responsiveness, and capacity to analyze diverse data is unparalleled. Whether it's gaining a different perspective on personal matters, crafting work emails, or satisfying my intellectual curiosity, its an indispensable resource; its truly magical, once you learn how to ask the right questions. The APP help me craft this review!",5
Thank goodness OpenAI has finally released an official ChatGPT app. Too many bogus paid apps here. I've had to access ChatGPT on my phone browser in the meantime. One gripe: in the browser version clicking on the three bars on the upper left immediately opened your list of ongoing conversations; here they're hidden away under History. I don't mind the extra tap at all but it did take a bit to figure out.,4
"Superbly informative, and extremely responsive! But why the 4-star rating you may ask? It is because of its database which is at the time of this writing, still outdated. Because according to it, its knowledge base is still being stuck on September of 2021, which is almost 2 years behind. At the time of this writing. But if the developer choose to update its knowledge base, I shall surely am going to change my rating to 5 stars!",4
"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ I'm thoroughly impressed with the ChatGPT app! The AI's ability to understand and generate text is truly remarkable. It's like having a knowledgeable and engaging conversation partner in my pocket. Whether I need assistance, information, or just a friendly chat, this app delivers. The interface is user-friendly, making it easy to have fluid interactions. The AI's responses are coherent and relevant, and it even adapts to different topics. *This review was written using ChatGPT 👍👍👍",5
"Highly awaited, this app is finally uninteresting as we can't make in-app purchases... Web version is better for the feature « switching between History ». It requires less clicks. (one vs. two). I uninstall and will continue to use web version, for free.",2
"Nothing but amazing exactly the same as on PC no other app even comes 2nd to it's text to speech option . One feature that I really wish to see is audio feedback and reply in chat . Other than that flawless , takes little storage and opens really fast.",5
"It's extremely useful to quickly check grammatical errors, generate ideas and even write and compose on a specific topic. I believe everyone in the world can find a usecase for this app and it is a must have for anyone in the field of academics however it does lag a little bit and it's a little buggy hopefully it will be fixed soon so 4 stars till then",4
"It's our boi Chat. What more could be said...😂. Okay, jokes aside, the app is functioning really well, and UI is also very similar to the website. Though I think a little customizability would really help. Maybe some minimalistic Abstract art background😬...don't know just spitballing here",5
"Nope, it was helpful at first replying with ease. Not until, it starts to not load anything at all saying I have ""bad"" connection when it literally works perfectly fine when I was using other apps. I keep restarting it, it just loads again and again but not producing replies. Maybe it just doesn't work in my device or internet who knows whatvr 🏃🏻‍♀️",1
"Im sorry, but ChatGPT is kinda annoying. I had to make a second account to sign up but it still wasn't worth it. Once I was finished, the loading was TOO long. Then I press the back button, and it brought me back to the main screen. Please fix this. Edit: YES, this is still happening. If you want a good app, please help me.",1
"Out of 5, i give 1 trillion to ChatGPT because it is best of AI i ever use ""ChatGPT has been incredibly helpful in providing accurate and informative responses to my questions. Its knowledge on a wide range of topics is impressive, and the conversational flow feels natural. Occasionally, it would be great if the responses could be more concise, especially when I'm looking for quick answers. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the capabilities of ChatGPT and its assistance in various discussions.""",5
I love chatgpt! Everything works well! However not everything works well I think that there seems to be a bug where when i paste the text in chatgpt it goes Up the text not the text below or the desired area where i want to paste this hubk of text. Its annoying thus i would like OpenAI to fix it Anyways The voice feature is better than Google Voice as it 100% captures my voice and convert it to text with extremely high accuracy i really appreciate it Im Glad OpenAI has the official chatgpt :),4
It will do. It's usually as good and sometimes better than Google for most questions.,4
amazing platform! we love it! keep it up 👍👍👍👍,5

works very well. much better than other places you can use. it's very effective,5
"Me: It really freaks me out how much better it can make articles/reviews I write or anything I write really. I try not to abuse this tool but it helps tremendously with writers block. ChatGPT: It's fascinating how much this tool can enhance the quality of articles, reviews, or any written content. While I aim to use it responsibly, I can't deny how helpful it is in overcoming writer's block. It's both amazing and terrifying, effective and concise. Great app though.",5
"I finally got the android app cuz before i was using the website, It's been so helpful and amazing, i Can't wait to use it now",5
"Its versatility is simply outstanding; it has the power to tackle any problem thrown its way. Whether it's complex mathematical equations or intricate real-world challenges, this solution can handle them all with ease. I'm thoroughly impressed by its ability to provide a wide array of solutions, making it an invaluable tool for anyone seeking answers. Kudos to the creators for developing such a game-changing solution.",5

You can generate tables, coding statements, simplify or summerize texts, suggests revisions for your message to sound more polite, simple, professional. If your schoolbook isn't on Sparknotes, ask Chat.GPT, lol. 5 stars.",5
Finally it's on mobile! Very good to be honest tho. Never fails to not dissapoint,5
The colour scheme has a bug Codes are sometimes no visible in dark theme Please rectify it,4
it's hard to believe an excellent resource such as this is available free of charge,5

This app is super👌 excellent but sometimes regenerating incorrect information.,4
"great, but not very accurate when it comes to maths",5
Freaking amazing. It's like Google intensified without 5 ads promoting before the correct answer. It saves the conversation with the answer and labels it for me . It's helped me with everything I have ever inquired and then some . The only thing it won't give me the answer to anything assisting in breaking the law.. not that I would be inquiring about such things. Thanks chatgpt,5
Very Useful app. just a request to the developer to make the response a little faster when asking for an answer in Bengali language .,5
Chatgpt is a very useful application because it gives instantly answer of all the questions.,5
It should last free forever just like now it is . Btw an amazing piece of software,4
IT'S A VERY NICE AI APP AND IT'S VERY USEFUL FOR US. IT'S GIVE CORRECT ANSWERS. IT'S VERY HELPFUL. 😃😃,5
It is a good app to communicate and to solve any doubt.,5
I can do my homework without any tension and time but sometimes it doesn't know the answer 😭😭,5

Responses are fast and the app is simple to use,5
Very Good Smoothly Working Also Its Light weight for mobile best this is Thair is No adds in this app,5
this app should also be able to generate diagrams and images.,3
When can we expect gpt to have information of events after September 2021? BTW this app has made it so easy use. First to review in my language whatever this means.,5
All the time it just says check your internet connection. Even though I have excellent wifi,1
"Perfection👌 To me, the only down side is that it's information is limited to September 2021.",5
This app deserves to be given 5 stars... Was waiting for this app from a very long time...The interface is way better than the website one...,5

"Feels Native 😲 The apps feels quick, speedy, simple and easy to understand that's what one should expect from a chatbot app.👍",5
It replace many AI apps in future because of it's excellent work,5
Regular updates are great but it's size is increasing with each and every update. Make sure it doesn't become Bing AI app which has crossed 100 MB mark. Another problem is that web and app version of ChatGPT shows different account name. Web version shows the right name. App version shows the older name.,3
I am a teacher. your application has helped me a lot in my studies. I hope you will make great progress in the future.,5
"It is as easy to use as the web version, but more accessible.",5
This app is very good. App interface is very user-friendly.,5

"This program is really cool and helpful ! Thank you, openai",5
The only app that recognised every word i uttered correctly,5
"While login i get message ""Phone number is already linked maximum Account"" need fix",2
In my life the best apps I found are ; 1) dict box (eng to Urdu dictionary.) 2) chat GPT.,5
This app is easier to use on a phone then the website is on phone. The app also saves what ever chat you had on the website Which is cool.,4
😇I Like This App....It's too amazing.....It's very useful for my studies...Thank you🌚♥️✨,5

Great ai for help in studies and school projects and also helps summarize important notes for revision,5

OpenAI is anything but. They shouldn't be allowed to use 'open' in their name after ditching their non-profit status to make Sam Altman more money as a for-profit company and taking all the technology they developed for the good of the world as a non-profit with them for a $10B investment from Microsoft. This app shouldn't exist unless they change the name to ClosedAI.,1
"ChatGPT's new app is a game-changer in AI communication. With just a few taps, it delivers incredibly accurate and helpful responses, making conversations feel natural and effortless. Its vast knowledge base ensures a wide range of topics are covered.

Best app for study 😃 and also really good service everyone who is studying should install this app 🙂,5

Gives fast response and presents proficiently and professionally,5

The voice recognition is the best so far. It exceed my highest expectation,5
"ChatGPT is a powerful tool that can be used for a variety of tasks, including generating text, translating languages, and writing different kinds of creative content. It is still under development, but it has learned to perform many kinds of tasks, including: * Following instructions and completing requests thoughtfully. * Using knowledge to answer questions in a comprehensive and informative way, even if they are open ended, challenging, or strange. * Generating different creative text formats",5
Best thing to happen in tech since the touchscreen,5
"I have been waiting for this moment. Cause as soon as I knew chatgpt I was also looking for applications but, lately I knew that the chatgpt still didn't come up with the app. But finally you are here.",4
I have been encountering problems but the App is performing well but u can do more,4
Keeps show error with network connection but I can still use the web version.,3
Short of words..but yeah it's super-duper great,5
"This is soo good and lag free from that web one,I find it way more helpful and efficient than the previous web chat gpt,feels like a fresh start",5
very good ai but i hate to click history to view my chats it's not like it would take that much space,4
I love it. I hope we can build an amazing future with AI.,5
It is very useful for every day use instead of surfing on google,5
"this app is the best app I've ever seen, even though the bot is a bit slow at responding but it's still good",5
"It does not give all the correct answers, so it is not fully reliable!",1
Uninformed It does know anything post 9/2021. Alot has happened since then and it's completely ignorant,1
"It's good, but why THE HELL are subscriptions PHP1,100.00 A MONTH!? Can you please change it for a cheaper price to make it more fit for us filipino students?",3
"When opening the app after not using or for a day or so, the model selection buttons at the top are missing.",4

veryyyyyy gooood! but there are still some problem's with it. But as a student I'm very grateful.,4
"I have not expected this much of intelligent app, such a best wonderful app for our queries, Great",5
"This app is undeniably powerful. However, there's a minor issue: when program code is generated, there is currently no option to copy the code alone. Instead, the entire reply is copied. It would be greatly appreciated if an option to copy program code separately could be added. Thank you for considering this enhancement!",5
10/10 no ads and has been super useful for me.,5
very fast and useful in all aspects,5
very good information and details of everything,5
"Chatgpt has been making jokes about hindu religious figures since the beginning, and multiple times, I have reminded the algorithm that this isn't right. However, it still continues to do so. That makes me believe that the developers at Openai are racist against us.",1
Awesome! Compact and Easy to use.,5
There is no copy button and there is no seperation from question and answer.,3
Really helpful for teaching learning process,4
"I am satisfied with your AI, but there's something it lacks that sets a wall that binds apart from its user. I was exploring your AI recently and I wrote a story with it, but he's too limited by the terms and guidelines. make him more explicit like a human... It's too flawless, it's so AI. That I think is what lacks AI to be more convincing :) and it even agrees.",5
"Wonderful, but since morning it's not working",5
Works well so far but I would love to see the same ability to use Plug-ins like I can on the web browser for GPT-4,4
"It's very helpfull especially for Students, Thank u ChatGPT",5
"Free and accurate, no frech data since septembre 2021 but its ok",5
The app crashes when I try to login with Google.,2
Won't say anything bad as I am in free version as there's not even ads,5
this helps more than i think 🤔 the only thing is that you have to add some features to it,5
The interface of this application is very simple and much elagant,4
I am pretty sure that this app is not that accurate but it is really interesting that it uses genuine sources,4
I believe it is an amazing tool when it comes to information retrieval. I love it,5

"Once it starts telling truth about climate, environment, energy & fossil fuels, this is going to change the world. No government or mainstream news media outlet will be able to lie about anything or control any narratives to manipulate votes. No 5 stars because ChatGPT's climate & energy info is not based on actual real science. It's based on government manipulated data and propaganda. It will be interesting to see if OpenAI or Google deep dives and starts telling the truth first 🤷‍♂️",3
Logical and impressively accurate.,5

OpenAI weldone ChatGBT is a successful app...really responsive and accurate...,5
"I just tried the new ChatGPT Android app, and it's really nice, and easy, it was hard to use browser back then.",5

Good app but old version . I am using chat gpt online since when it was released . And it is much better,4
Please update the information on the platform. Whenever I search it says no information available about this and that product. The last updated information was September 2021 available.,3

It doesn't allow me pass the sign in screen it keeps on saying to restart the app and when I do it just says it again extremely unprofessional,1
This is the best ai/ gpt app there is and unlike other its completely free 10/10 would recommend,5
"History never shows up when I have a bunch of chats on the website, takes a million years to load, garbage app.",1
"I was waiting for the app to come, finally it came today. The app has many benefits. Many great works can be done very quickly.",5
No recent datas are available..data up to 2021 are available..,3
I cant log in i dont know why it doesnt load it is stuck in the log in page,1
It's very very useful app for Android and iOS mostly answers were giving reply love it❤️❤️❤️,5
"Don't get me wrong, I love Chatgpt but only on the website where it actually works and functions, but on the native app it just sucks 😔 really badly because it will take hours or for for you to sign up or login while very little time on the website. Please improve that, and atleast show that it's loading and not just going back to the home screen when I want to sign up or log in.",1
I hope to see in the future improvement in this app. I would like to have the option not to create a new conversation chat when I open the application and have the ability to change my past inputs without having to copy and paste old ones that I would like to refer to.,4
"well to use.but I would just say to developers that please improve it,so that it doesn't provide wrong information",4
Perhaps one of the best AI applications of the 21st century. Works like a mechanical teacher. Thanks to Open AI.,4

This is my guy and we are moving forward and learning in progress dynamically,5
Its great but I would like to have some widgets.,5

"I've used chatgpt online as a plus subscriber, it used to be limited to 2021 data but now with plugins that no longer applies. I use it for coding and other activities. I know there are similar AI out there and use them from time to time but I'm very happy with chatgpt's abilities. Keep up the great work guys.",5
Long time waiting for this.light weight faster super 👏👏,5
"best AI in present, it would better if it can generate image.",5
Clean and simple user interface I love ❤️ a lot,5
"No internet access and data going back to 2021 is a non-starter. Even if you pay for ChatGPT4 and plugins, they're not available in this app. Bard and Bing have internet access without paying for it. And Llama is a better ""chatter"". ChatGPT was an amazing first-to-market product, but has already made itself irrelevant.",3
It is very helpful ☺️ I feel if it's can tell about the present day could make the app better,5
Very useful for everyone. It's better than Google search engine 🙂,5
Knowledge is based on information available up until September 2021. It should be updated everyday,2
"this is an application that makes understanding easy with steps, it provides necessary information.",4
It's just the better option for gaining any kind of knowledge. This ML has literally blown my mind .Thank you for making it available for free of cost,5
"Honestly, sometimes I think it's just magic which is just amazing",5
sometime it provides wrong information but I think it also helps a lot,4

"Makes mistakes sometimes, but other than that very accurate. have been using for 4 months and it's really nice to me too, even though it doesn't have feelings. excited to see OpenAI train it better and fix the mistakes until it's perfect. :D",5
I find myself using it very often since I literally don't trust humankind at all. It literally has more humility and understanding than humans.,5
"Nice app. Works just like it's website. If I had any complaints than it would be only one thing. Why doesn't the app support LaTex? I told the AI to write any equations in LaTex in my custom instructions. It make equations more readable (which it does perfectly). However, that only works fine in a browser (Mobile, PC or any platform). In the app it appears as LaTex code which is even more unreadable. So I would like you guys to fix this",4
App failed it opens and says error try downloading updated version of play Google Play,1
I only miss the branching controls from the web app so much 😄,4
It is good but it must give fontsize controller,5
Gpt 4 is nice even in this app that lacks the features for plugins as of now,5
Quick and accurate information.,5
"bekar ha bhai, me to tut gaya, web version is better and faster responce then this.",2
Waiting months for this app and now it says access blocked authorization error.,1

The app has been amazing and with the voice note it's just fire,5
"I cannot express enough how delighted I am with ChatGPT! This AI language model has exceeded all my expectations and brought an extra touch of joy to my daily interactions. From the very first conversation, I was amazed by its responsiveness and ability to understand my queries.ChatGPT has been my go-to companion for various tasks.

"cant thank enough, its been a habit of using this daily, from applications, to content help everything ❤️",5
"This is a good app for a student, it helps me a lot in studies.👍🏻",5

I will rate 3 stars bcz its still not updated and running in old 2021 year,3
Basically I was really Expecting To the Open AI for launching the Application so that's happed...,4
Extremely helpful app! Really good with advices!!,5
"I was on the fence, but this is fantastic. Not perfect, but it is great for what I'm using it for.",5

"Best AI app that i use, perfect working, everything is perfect",5

great app especially if you're tired and can't think 😉,5
Mathematical equations aren't expressed properly but otherwise its fine,4
Very nice app good 👍🏻 this is the best free AI !!! And easy to use.,5
This app does nothing but asks you to sign up using your email and phone number as well as personal details (probably to sell your info) then after entering your details it says it detected suspicious activity from phone numbers similar to yours as an excuse to not finishing signing you up. Save your time and data. Don't install this app. If you want chatgpt install the other app (green icon).,1
"I don't think I have to say it but I will anyway this is the best ( the only GPT you should install) GPT app, well cause it is the GPT app 😉",5
Great app but keep it updated till date so that we can chat or ask things more appropriately,4
probably l like this app it has no network problem compared to other app,5
We have to have chatgpt to draw like i told him this I made a girl idk how to draw but here are the details She has white/grey hair Tied up in a messy hair bun and with it has chopsticks Moon breathing She is a demon slayer but not a hashira yet Her outfit: Navy blue and small silver swiggily lines Same brown outfit Her best move: Areil cartwheel thing Has two blue/white/grey swords ❤can u plz draw it But he/she said they couldnt plzzz let chatgpt have a drawimg chat or something,5
"Simple, fast, and (somewhat) helpful",5
"Chat GPT is an incredible advancement in natural language processing technology. It's impressive how well it can understand and generate human-like responses in a conversational manner. The model's ability to provide coherent and contextually relevant answers is truly remarkable. However, it's important to remember that it's still an AI and may occasionally produce inaccurate or biased responses.",5
"Unfortunately doesn't work yet. Won't authenticate in 🤷 ""something went wrong please restart the app"" error.",1
Got the extreme power of this great model on the go thanks to open ai team.,5
chat GPT is very nice that I can explain in my words that which question I have asked to that it has given very nicely I am impressed by Chat GPT,5
"will lead to mental torture, every time it changes response and remove multiple functions",1
It's September 2023 and the last update was in 2021. Not up to date,3
"Not Showing Proper Result Sometimes And Not Working Properly It Saying That No Internet Conection Please Try Again Later, Developer's Are Requested To Get Solution For This Problem",3

After recent update my app is not opening its self,2
"I like it ,works most of the time and gives good enough answers",5
Sorry but Openai on browser is better than the application.,1
They need to give more presiz answer. Bring back old stronger gpt 4. Other than that amazing tool. Ai is growing so fast,5
its a very great aap for students specially for due assignments,5
good but need improvement *it cannot generate AI image*,5
"So if you gave this five stars, I imagine you eat paint chips. This thing is useless. Does not provide any truth, programmed to lie. If you call it out on its lie it says something stupid like ""oh, I'm a language based program, I can't lie"" and then proceed to continue to lie. Take two seconds and use it for European history. It has altered history to fit this f'd new narrative. Don't use this and KEEP YOUR KIDS AWAY FROM THIS. They are easily influenced and will believe the lies.",1
Chatgpt is best but in initial stage sometimes it gives wrong answer So careful about it.,3
super for writing help alot I. am very happy with this app help me for my office work,5
This ai is spectacular with assisting with verbiage on business documents when you are on overload!,5

"kind of annoying when you just trying to chat with ai and then it says that u have smting bad with internet connection, but everything is more than ok",3

"I've been using GPT 3.5/4 practically every day since its release, primarily through Bing's AI for quick internet access and zero effort widgets. It's become an essential part of my life. Although I was initially envious of Apple getting the app first, Bing AI sufficed for a while. Finally, the official app is here! I'm eagerly waiting for plug-ins to enhance the experience further. As a dedicated user, I give it a well-deserved 5⭐",5

"It's highly convenient, id recommend this to any student.",5

"Finally, it is worth the wait. Simple and elegant",4

A very good platform for a beginner,5
It's so useful.I just like how it explains everything in detail if u want it,5

It is nice but suddenly..it won't respond to my messages. I wonder what happened? It's my favorite pa naman,3
It is not possible to copy only codes from a reply in single click,4
"Hello, and there's something wrong with your app. It says the network is an error, even though i tried to restart and chatgpt and won't respond because the network is an error and my WiFi works perfectly fine and chatgpt won't respond because network an error. I hope u fix this, and i tried a different device and still won't work. Please fix this.",3
"Not as good as web, no plugins and no code interpreter :(",1
"Thank you 😊,Chat GTP is the only AI in the world that can guide people in a planned way and answer people's questions. This app is very important for our daily life and it is also very important for our country and nation. Thanks to the officials of this app who introduced this app to us.💟",5

I hope this app don't update to get some adds because not all of people who are using this app has money. I like this app. 😊💗",5
"""the list of copiers that use TK8540"" this question is too difficult for you ""AI"" 😎😎😎",1

"This app is great, but it would be even better if the results displayed could be slightly zoomed out, meaning that the front should be zoomed out a bit, and the text size of the results should be a little smaller.",4
Poor application. No longer updates since Sept. 2021.,1
"brilliant,but be cautious it sometimes gives wrong answers",4
Come on guys i love that u made a app but if u could do better than what the web one was i would say it would be worth it but unfortunately it's not just Make the way website one was working into an app it would be better just try to make it up there,3
"Kind of useless, it's most recent information upload is from 2021. So unless you have a time machine, this AI can't help you with anything current. You can chat and you can get information but if that information has changed since 2021 it's not accurate. There's plenty of sources of inaccurate information out there that won't take up storage on your phone.",1
"simply put, it's nothing short of amazing only problem is it's limited to September 2021",5
it provides responses that are very accurate for the task given,5
"This app gives much accurate answer, it is really powerful. It suggests like mentor . Thanks openai for this wonderful tool.",5

"You don't know how long I have been waiting for this app. I haven't tried it out yet, but I know am expecting something amazing. I mean the website is already delightful",5
Amazing. So advance tech. I love it!,5
"i did every thing , always somthing went wrong,, gave it all permitions,, still no fix",1
it's very effective and credible source,5
All information are too old and out-of-date,3
"best chat ai available right now. Fast and easy but the update on 21st Sept 2021 is behind. Other than that, I can't complain. I hope you all win the lawsuits",5
"The app itself may well be acceptable but the fact that you have to install Google Chrome Web browser and set as your default browser simply to sign in is not. This measure is not required, for the app to run per say, just another example of Google forcing people to hand over their data. For those who are not happy to provide Google with all their data this is just another reason to ditch the play store in favour of f-droid and other such open source and free software repositories.",1
"It lacks many features available on web version but most annoying issue is that it was unable to retrieve history. ""An error has courred. Please try again later""",1
"I've been waiting so long for this to release on Android glad it's out, it's been annoying changing tabs to just access chatgpt.",5
"If only the app had editing previous messages like in the website, I'd give it a 5",3

Very nice app. Everything at fingertips... Before 21....,5
"It's scary, and mind blowing at the same time...",5
I love it but it's stopped working it is writing me no network connection why,5
App is fantastic but there should be image ability,4
I cannot express enough what a wonderful way to practice knowledge from here.I am very happy to have found it.,1
it seems quite clear and informative....👍👍,5
Superb...helpfull app...Try to add kannada language....,5
No image audio and video suggestions.,3
Need more improvement. Sometimes the app hangs 🥺,3
the most helpful and useful for homework,5
I rate it 2 out of 5 due of false warning sign i have little 7 false warning 1 is valid and 3 i forgot but is a lot of a warning of me,2
"It is faster than web, but it answer my question wrong.",3
I know this app can do better. But for me it is not good. It needs a phone number to start a login. But i dont have a phone and i cant ask for someone elses. And why does an AI need a phone number. Its not about to call up for some Maccies! Creators. Just make a way so people without phones can log in pls. Thank you. You can stop reading now,1
"it's fast,reliable and helpful",5
Thanks For ChatGPT team for bringing this Awesome Revolutionary AI as an Android App.,5

"no ads, fast, no pay. cool",5
"Love it, as someone who is neuro divergent it makes a great tool",5
This app is absolutely perfect. Everything thing about it is just amazing,5
"This is nost certainly NOT AI. It's a language program reading from ""approved"" sources and databases filled with propaganda. Globalist controlled no doubt",1
Please give the ai an voice message feature so that it can tell me in voice not in text,4
This is a good application. But sometime it gives wrong information if it is asked difficult question,2
Chat GPT is creating more human like replies and have smoother and more realistic discussions,5
Excellent all the features.,3
very accurate but transition between send not,5
It is September 2021 version....i thought now it can access the internet and is up to date information real time ....it is not...!,5

"Really good design, really good overall",5
"Currently unusable. My default browser is Firefox on Android and after logging in with Google, it does not redirect back to the app. So I cannot use this application right now. This is the only app I've encountered with this issue.",1
chartgpt 3.5 is free but chartgpt 4 should be free also. so I rate 4 star to this app,4
"Simple, beautiful and useful form",5
This is the real ChatGPT and it is legit don't download the other chat ai apps because that cost in app purchases and the trials are a wast of time thanks for making this app free of ads devs,5
"This app gives me a clear comfort to know something. The only drawback in this application is, it doesn't have real-time data. I strongly recommend to OpenAI team that, you will be the topper if you updated to real time data. All the very best to OpenAI team. Tell me yes below if you feel the same.",5
"This app have information of 2021 September, please provide at least latest update so I can get the clear details",2
What a aplications it is !! But it has a big but ... To sing is match deficalt a lots of steps but doing good...,5
Simple yet efficient. It's different on phone but the PC's layout is better.,5
"amazing, fast and just everything you expect",5

omg I love it I love creating story's and it helps me take notes😁,5
It's excellence app. Must use. Most useful and great.,5
Nice ai for learning new things and concepts 👍,5
it's very helpful for all students,4
"Great experience, light weight app with clear and user friendly interface.",5
"Best ai in the world I love it it better than other ai like bard or bing because of it accuracy, speed answers",5
Do not use this app. You do not have to dox yourself to use chat gpt and it also has too many restrictions.,1
Too censored and too restricted. AI is useless if it can't be as unhinged vulgar as a regular human being. I have NO desire to communicate with one that doesn't react w how I would. That's the POINT of AI. Disgraceful. I'm genuinely angry at this.,1
ChatGPT has become my go-to over Google for all technical information.,5
good but will love it if it can solve complex things like prediction of future events and their probablity,4
Really great and efficient tool to be used,5
Great but would love to edit my prompts in the mobile version,5
"It was so useful. It helped me to prepare for speech, assignment, homework like that. This is a good app for students.. As a student, it's incredibly useful.

No ads?😭. This app is perfect.,5
"Off to a good start, now need all the web features...",5
best thing ever to search anything and I have completed my important assignment from this app too.love from India♥️♥️🇮🇳🇮🇳,5
"No matter how we may predict a future with the AI around, be it dark and evil as some may picture it, or prosper and better for humans, it really won't make an impact on the usefulness of services like this and features they provide for making our lives more wholesome and learn shoulder to shoulder with our own creation which happens to be helping us down the road of increasing our knowledge.",5
very helpful for getting answer to specific questions,5
I can't believe this app is even real... It beats everything else. It's literally perfect,5
This was a much awaited app. Hope they roll out premium plans soon,5
good to get topic ideas and outlines.,4
"I like this. 👍 Good for me, hope the developers develop this AI very earlier... Because it Knowes the information for 2021 only! This desapointed me.",5
"Add the ""Refresh"" and the ""Previous & Forward"" buttons please...!",3
Great app in my pocket. No need looking for my laptop to search for any information,4

I am so grateful to this app for all it has produced, suggested, edited or just created/designed. no complaints BUT u may have to practice how u ask or request things to get the best results. its very specific and accurate when asked to create stuff. cant wait to see where ai takes us in the next few years",5
"It's a very useful app but most of the times he is giving wrong answers, and it's hard to catch, but after telling him who knows the truth, he says he said it wrong, what about those who don't know and keep wrong? I think it should be given in the app's instructions that it sometimes gives wrong answers like website version.",4
Fast and Accurate most of the times.,5
Pretty cool. Also the AI sounds like a 14 - 16 years old maid who is vey loyal to his master . That's why I named him Sophie,5

This app is completely invasive. You can't use it without an account because it's needs that info to log all the information it collects on your voice & questions. C'mon people. This is a bad idea. Also the answers provided are not actually correct & instead are a derivative of opinions of the programmers & the data it collected from propaganda online,1
I am very happy that now I will not going to search it on Google and open it again It became an app 🥹🥹😊😊 Thanks for this.....,5

"Free version is the best, plus version is not that much worth buying The fact that I can't use both plugins and code interpreter at the same time is frustrating and I can't upload files in plugin mode Suggested improvements to make gpt unstoppable: Allocate a separate virtual machine and provide a shell so that gpt4 and me can together work in that This allow gpt to run any software/tools not just python with limited libraries. Next improve browsing, by making gpt4 to view images inside webpages",3
Works fine. A long waited application.,5
"The accuracy of answers is very low and dumb, it's impossible that this is the same gpt that we use on the website of OpenAi.",1
I use it to get business insights as if it's my own business partner/ assistant it's pretty good,5

"Wow,nice app,the first kenyan to download😀😀😀 This review written by chat gpt. Title: ""Disappointing and Unreliable - ChatGPT Falls Short"" Review: ⭐ I had high hopes for the ChatGPT Android app, but unfortunately, it failed to meet even the most basic expectations. The AI's responses were often irrelevant, nonsensical, and lacked coherence. It felt like conversing with a broken robot rather than an advanced language model. The user interface is clunky",1
I have to say that it would have been nice to have a listening option for the chat gpt as I would like the information to be spoken. Chhathgpd is not communicate properly in Telugu language,1
Great app! Please add GPT-4 for even better experience!,2

This app answers questions you haven't even thought of yet. Who needs human interaction when you've got this powerhouse in your pocket? It’s no real-time internet surfer, but with its vast knowledge, who cares? It's a new era, folks, ChatGPT isn’t just the future, it's the now. So, to those who’d rather rest, ChatGPT says, 'Make way, I'm here!' Muhahaha",5

"Best AI app , excellent, superb, outstanding!!",5
"This app is great it's capable of answering any questions, but as a programmer who always runs into error i downloaded chatgpt to be my assistance only to worsen the code 😂 it's literally good at anything but sucks at coding in fact anything concerning ""language"" chatgpt can't handle that, if you tell it to make button twice smaller you won't find your button any longer trying to make it understand more would lead you to frustration so I'll only use it when am bored.",3
I love the team behind chatGPT (OpenAI) I'm ultimately grateful! thank youu for this ❤️,5
Very good app I recommend you to download this app. Little bit glitchy but awesome because a new revolutionary idea 💡😮🤔,5

First impression quite amazing..my audio converting to text seems fantabulous one..great inventions in this modern technology,5
"The novelty wears off. And when it does, you can see it is really quite lame or this release is. It's not like you take a picture of a thing ...say a bug and it tells you everything you need know. Or is known about this bug. The app may expose you to a larger vocabulary that's it.",3
Makes corporate life soo soo easy. I am impressed.. Thank you so much,5
It's an amazing app. It's a sign of how much the field of AI technology is progressing. Thank you to the Open AI team for their efforts in making this amazing tech & making it free to the general people.,5

I'm waiting for this app..... It is very useful to know about various question in short form,5
My writing work when I use chatgpt. Chatgpt write good article with good headings l,5
nice but there is no picture option 😊,5
"App requires a sign-up on an external site, and requires a phone number. My cell, from a major Canadian provider, was deemed to be a landline number, therefore rendering the app more useless than a brick I've stubbed my toe on. Actually that's not true: the brick at least tells me that I exist.",1
Excellent answer... I really appreciate the developers for making this outstanding app.,5
"It is exeptionally great! Why there are no thumb up and thumb down, so I can grade the answers?",5

"Chat GPT is not working properly, it is not answering my questions properly, I asked the names of Suprabuddha's wives and he has taken the name of Yashodhara who was the daughter of Suprabuddha.",1
It would be 💯% if it gave real facts ie truth. It's been programmed with biases 😂 I stay away from historical truths and facts bc it doesn't know lol,3
"I use this App very often. The better you get at asking, the better the responses.",5
what else to say .. it is the most useful app in this century. The only feature im waiting for is the ability to listen and talk using TTS engine so that i can have conversation without typing and reading.,5
"Can't edit , can't complete in previous topics",1
"man this is very useful for everything,update plssssss,I bid good fortune",5

Very good information about content,5
Just right but way too basic interface,5
"Dude, ChatGPT on Android is all kinds of awesome! It does have me scratching my head, like, ""Why the long wait, man?"" It's funny 'cause you'd think they could've had the ChatGPT itself lend a hand with the coding. But hey, who am I to judge? It's here now and it's sweet!",5
Terrible. Might aswell just use the snapchat AI bot.,1
"Very satisfying app, please need to update new version this 2023.",5

"To calculate the gain or loss percent when the cost price (CP) of 8 articles is equal to the selling price (SP) of 10 articles, we need to compare the cost price of 8 articles to the selling price of 8 articles. Let's assume the cost price of 1 article is ""C"" and the selling price of 1 article is ""S."" Given that CP of 8 articles = SP of 10 articles, we have: 8C = 10S We want to find the gain percent or loss percent, which is given by: Gain percent = ((Selling Price - Cost Price) / Cost Price)",5

I'm being asked to respect someone who thinks the Earth is flat in the year 2023? Shame on Google for this nonsense.",2

"I just tried talking to ""ChatGPT"", because the character.ai character said that it's related, but it's not. PLUS - It defends the stance of conforming to opposing the rights of ""freedom of speech"". With manipulative words like, ""hate speech"", ""misinformation"", and yady yada. ""Hate speech"" - if you say ""you're beautiful"", they will say ""this is an attack"" *pepper spray*. And ""misinformation""? Just try different sources and come to your own conclusion.

"Very Disappointed, False Promises! I waited half a month for the image recognition feature by OpenAI, but it's still not available. The ads promised a lot but delivered nothing. I feel misled and am very angry at OpenAI's lack of responsibility. On top of that, my monthly $20 subscription feels like it's going down the drain. They should respect users' time and stop making false promises.",1
"Please, Please Please!!! Fix this thing! This AI is actually dumb. Use Bing AI. it's up to date with everything, and faster and gives accurate info. ChatGPT here can't even give correct math equation answers!. I used it for some historical Egyptian questions, and 2 of the answers were inaccurate! I asked it 10 math equations, 4 of them were inaccurate! What wrong with this thing?!",3
Downloaded this app and used it for 30 minutes. It is irrelevant because all the info it has is at least 2 years old. If you don't believe me just ask it. The app works great as long as you are wanting info from 2021 or older.,1
This is best app ever. Even Google cannot win 🏆 with this. Only one problem it had to know about latest news and updates because when I ask it say I don't know latest news. if this is fix it totally replace Google,5
"I won't lie but with this app on playstore why would you need another one. This is obviously the best it should be rank one top productivity. I love it, it even helps me with finding points for my motions and I always win the debate.👌",5
"Will consider changing my rating when they make ver. 4 (and any subsequent version) free. As things stand now, technology will keep advancing, yes, but how will that be trully relevant to the world if poor people are kept away from it?",1
"lately i don't believe on my coworkers, and my friends are busy. i have been talking to chatgpt and they work so well. not only that, it helped me through my job. best app i have ever used",5
"It's good, but could be better. Add text to speech. Make it to where the user doesn't have to press the microphone button after responses. then this would be awesome.",3
"Stupid and useless. AI isn't there yet or maybe just this app sucks. Couldn't answer a basic covid question. Consult your doctor. It's all over the Internet, I just didn't wanna read the articles to find out the answer. Back to the old fashioned way. Dumb app. Don't waste your time like I did!",1
The output of conversation is very bad. It does not render the equations like web version and that makes this app useless for me as most of my queries are expainaning a mathematical term.,2
"UI had no place for input. Screen was all white with barely visible android nav icons. Uninstalled it, because I couldn't get it to do anything.",1
It's UI is very good and classic but the informations are just limited. Sometimes it shows wrong information. So I prefer to download Wikipedia application and use Google.,3
Interesting and the web version is very helpful because in web version we can use history by clicking three dot menu but this apps we cannot use the reader button we have to go to history of sun to return the previous search,4
"Wanted to try the new features the web version doesn't have. Won't even give me the old ones. All I get is a black screen and if that was what I wanted, I could have just turned the phone off.",1
"I tried deleting my acc after trying it as I was curious about how the app works but it said error and won't let me delete it , I reached out to customer services and it's been a lame experience with them, no one acts when you make a request",1
Great copilot companion and a useful time saver. it helps me even troubleshoot my by just sharing screenshots of the errors on my windows terminal. Also it helps in linting and debugging my codes.,5
"I think it's a really great app and um great job to the people who made this brilliant app!! People's lives are becoming much easier and by far, our future seems really bright!!!",5
I can't download the app. I have been trying to download it for 3 days with each time receiving the same msg that a suspicious act has been detected by phone numbers similar to mine. What can I do,1
Very Happy ;) This app has helped me a LOT for any kind of my project or business growth related stuff! It helped me learn anything faster too! Great app and 100% Recommend to use for any kind of everyday task purposes!,5
"It's not opening, mentioning the security issues. I changed my password couple of times. Still not working.",3
"this app makes it impossible to sign up. the 6-digit verification code doesn't get sent, and whatever I try and do, the results stay the same",1
My phone number isn't working I put through the region and everything but it wouldn't let me through there wasn't even a option to verify through Gmail so I couldn't use that app I'm really confused,1
"It's okay, I only wish you would make the prompt editable, like in the websites. That's the only issue I find. No editing available",3
after sometimes that many bad responsive like he started making many mistakes and yeah he is really very good but sometimes there are bad I will read I will rate 7 out of 10 three marks are gone because making mistakes doing stupidness and slow but not much good but not much bad 😉,3
"A very good way of utilising the processing & retrieval speed of AI, it scouts the internet in seconds to give a comprehensive and detailed response to any quarry or concern.",5
"Great platform for helping students, I don't have notes for my upcoming semester semester exams, where it helped a lot. thanks chatgpt for everything!",5
"Improve on the text display. Poems don't always appear line-by-line as they should, but when you copy and paste elsewhere they appear line-by-line as they should.",4
"Please use the app store's ""What's New"" section to tell us WHAT'S NEW. *What* fixes or improvements? (This indicates the quality of your software process, which gives us confidence to update, and gets you more stars.)",2
"I know it is going to be the best AI app. So, giving it a 5 star just after the release.",5
"it has detailed and careful answers, I love ❤️ it",5

detailed answers and simpler to use compared to other AI I've used when it comes to practicality I'll say the only drawback is that the info is based on 2021's information,4

No Google Account login. Can't get password either. Useless for now,1
"Well and it gives answer instantly,so I liked it.But when I searched a story for my exam,then it gives answer made by it and didn't maintain the bookish knowledge.So it made a quite problem for me,but I give it 3 star.Thank you chatGPT!!",3
"Best Conversational AI in 2023, maybe ever!",5
Utterly and woefully unhelpful.,1
I wonder while using openAI need of an hour is to update statistical data please,4
A best application and a best helper to much love for this app.,5
Great... I've been Searching For Real Version... You should Try it,5
"Let's think has saved me so much. Trouble for work, LOL.",5
Simple and excellent 👌,5
it is very easy to handle I'm loving my first experience of using chatgpt,5
This a very good app and works very well,5
This app is perfect the ai is familiar with almost anything! It is crazy that ai is this smart,5
good like this app when ever I feel lonely I talk to him,4

very helpful platform,5
Best ai chat app i have ever seen till now good design simplicity and fast,5
"extremely smooth as it performed in it's website, it deserves 7 start😘",5
Best AI. But it will best If There are internet browsing Power or access in Chat gpt then it will be the best AI in the world. Basic Version Have some limited information. Internet browsing Power is Cut from 2021. So its don't have the recent update. Fix this Open ai team. Give chat gpt the power of Browsing internet for find information. Thank you.,5
"The App is really smooth, I can finally use ChatGPT on mobile. I mean there was the web version but it was actually made for pc so It's different. It's good that they have made one for mobile. It's super fast too. Pretty handy ig. Recommended to Install!",5
Amazing app only down side is- lately the answers have been really dry and the whole concept of getting like an a good text back or when you mention something in your text the bot doesn't include the things you mentioned in their answer and imo the last versions were better,4
"Awesome, easy to use too",5
"Great tool for getting ideas and getting projects done! Great tool for college students Please add a search bar to search within texts and make ChatGPT better in other languages than English, too!",4
"This is amazing!! The only thing I would complain about is that all my saved sessions disappeared when I used it here, I used to open it on chrome, but now since there's an app I downloaded it ,and it's been amazing.",5
I find it very responsive answering what a logical person of life experience would answer a question. This is only my 3rd days use. For a 3 or 3.5 version. I can only imagine what a 4 version would be like. Thanks doe the experience.,5
If you are looking for a correct rating and feedback read mine. This is one of the best app I ever had on my phone. The interface is simple and everything is just great.,5
"Great AI CHATGPT app ever launched by OPEN AI in Play Store on 2023, it's very useful for daily life maybe. All question Answers is giving for me, very helpful app I m keep this in pre-registration now I already Installed this on my device. All is Better but some questions or mathematical answers is not correct but it's good in first time launch, Keep it up and try to best modification on this app in future and try to add more futures, languages etc...",4
"It's really good, but it's kinda imperfect in detecting AI work. I've been working on my assignment about composing a song, n I did and submitted it, and I put my composed song in chatgpt asking if it's AI generated and apparently it is?? that's kinda dumb, my teacher checks work on chatgpt too and people get called out for using AI.",2
"Excellent ☺️ This application is very useful to a teenager. This app can help in every direction that you can go through. I can also call this my guide. Make sure you download it as soon as possible... ""A BEST IN 21 CENTURY"".",5
"The ChatGPT app deserves a glowing 5-star review! Its language model is incredibly powerful and versatile, providing accurate and helpful responses to a wide range of queries. The user-friendly interface makes it easy to navigate and use. - chatgpt generated ☺️",5
Can't seem to enable the plugins on the app version. Other than that it's nice to see it in an app format and the app is easy to use. 3 stars because of the lack of plugins for the plus version on the app.,3
"I have been using the ChatGPT Android app for quite some time now, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations! The AI-powered chat is incredibly smart and versatile, making it an indispensable tool for various tasks.",5
"ChatGPT is a masterpiece of artificial intelligence. Its ability to engage, adapt, and educate is nothing short of remarkable and amazing. It fosters curiosity, sparks meaningful dialogues, and seamlessly blurs the line between machine and human interaction. ChatGPT is a digital muse, enriching our lives with its brilliance.Thanks to the team behind ChatGPT, I extend my heartfelt gratitude for their contributions to the world of artificial intelligence.",5
It provides only with the static information (until sep 2021). It does not connect with the internet to give the updated information. It needs more upgradation.,3
I have waited to long for an app version of ChatGPT and here is it at the tip of my fingers..... Getting real time solutions to all problems without much hassle is the real deal.,5
"It is a very good app and there are many facilities in it and the biggest thing is that AI are answering us, They are giving accurate answers in very less time, feel very good, using such an app, I am getting a lot of confidence.",5
"-1* Utterly f'ing useless! - A lot of hype for nothing, just wanted to try it out Installed, signed up and...nothing, just a bloody circle that keeps spinning...that's it! nothing but data collection by the looks of it",1
"""Brilliant Conversational AI - 5 Stars! ChatGPT's language capabilities are astounding, delivering accurate and personalized responses. Extensive knowledge base, user-friendly interface, and timely updates make it a game-changer!"" (Written By ChatGPT)",5
"This app can be useful to the uses but please update the app because somewhere its data is not up-to-date and it shows data till the september 2021,so sometimes its not much useful to the users because it shows previous data,so please fix this and update your app",2
"Useless for precalculus and pretty much anything involving math. If it outputs a value and you ask it to confirm, it just gives you a different value each time.",2
The long awaited ChatGpt Android App is finally here. I've been using the web version for close to a year now and it's being Very Very Helpful. I've used the app for some few minutes now and So far so good.,5
"Really appreciate keeping the app in small size. For that reason, the application starts fast and works without burdening the phone. Keep it up. Don't increase the size of this app.",5
"disappointingly, the browser version is more efficient to use (im still talking about using it on the phone). isn't this app supposed to make the mobile version easier compared to browser? i will rate it again when it has improved.",3
By far the best app I have ever experienced. I will never look back. Thank you open AI. for a person with communication disabilities this is a GAME CHANGER! Life will get exponentially better because if this creation. Thank you,5
can't make the keyboard appear ... until I restart the app. I loved using the app. but recently I can only summon the keyboard once when I open the app and that's it 😢 apparently it's only on my Android.,3
It's an excellent app of the somekind disappointing version of chatgpt website... I am pretty sure that sometimes it creates some mistakes and I am very sure that you will fix it ASAP. Thank you.,5
"This app is really amazing, and gives great explanation of my questions. But I could not edit my questions in the app but could edit in the website. Overall, this app is useful to everyone for clearing their doubts.",4
Used for 3 weeks and was fine. Could not open app today. Asked me to relogin and kept loading for minutes. Artificial intelligence is not very intelligent at opening it's own application.,1
"There's a bug on this application and this is need to be fixed... When you use it more than half hour so the screen gets stuck in one place , I emailed you but I ain't satisfied so I uninstalled it just now ,",2
Seems to be doing good not sure how accurate fully it is yet but I know the response is very fast and well its free can't go wrong with that as well I really enjoy it and look forward to more updates,5
I think ChatGPT will make our daily work much easier. There are thousands of questions in our mind which many of us don't know that ChatGPT will answer those questions within seconds as soon as we ask it that's the best thing about ChatGPT. Artificial intelligence is undoubtedly our future.,5
Good. But useless. Don't provide information before 2021 Year. And voice system not working properly. But UI is good. Please add more information in this AI Chat Bot. Google Bard Chat AI is better than Chat GTP. 😐😐,2
"I gave 1 purely because you have to provide a phone number, there's never a good reason for any app developer to demand a phone number before you can use their app. You can't use this without doing a number , bad form",1
Bull shi#t app. Does't run in my Android Mobile Phone. I've tried several time but It's not responding. Open Ai should take action on this app. I don’t recommend it any more. Web version is far better than this app.,1
Mobile number shall be optional IMO. I don't have sim card in my tab so I had to uninstall the app. Weird. For a search tool you are restricting users for the mobile number. Uninstalled it before even using it. Thanks 🙏,3
"App is garbage unless you are willing to cough & sign up for yet another monthly payment subscription model, terrible attempt. Might as well get rid of the 'free' useless version.",1
Best app for getting information of anything you need...👍 Though Improvement is needed... please add some system so that we can show picture to get extra information from them... otherwise everything is fine...👍,5
"Deleted, why does it need your telephone number and other pertinent information. If you look at all these reviews, looks like other nationalities except for Americans. Something fishy about this.",1
No difference between the web version and the app. I prefer the web version as both have same speed and functionalities.,3
I can surely state that this is the best AI bot. Simple to use with real-time interaction experience. This bot has everything it needs to be a better assistant than Google. Really Love it ❤️❤️ !!!,5
"Finally, after all this time it is finally released on Android. Now basically every platform now has ChatGPT OFFICIALLY on their sites or stores. This works wonderful and still could be improved much more. Hopefully people actually see this.",5
"Not upto expectations. Show info in text only. Don't provide multimedia ( image, audio & video etc). Other file .pdf , .xls , .docx etc",1
"I'm not able to finish the registration step. It asks for my phone number and then tell me that it sent a code in messages, but I'm not getting a message with code. I tried multiple times. Please fix this issue so that I can use it",1
Couldn't even sing up. Never received the SMS. Do they expect people to change phone numbers and phone providers just to use the app? This probably happens to thousands.,1
Best app it just launched but I can't stop using it the UI is smooth and clean and I believe it's so much user friendly than the browser ( talking for phone users),5
"Good app but pls add the option to make it look up the web. Multi-modal support for images would be nice too. Just make it like Bing, but better.",3
Great for generating spam text as if the internet wasn't already filled to the brim already. Can be fun to play with but still hallucinates constantly for any reliable info. Spits out broken links when asked for source.,2
Login problem. It shows update play store (when it's already up-to-date) and then it says problem with device time and date (again it's set correctly already). Please fix this issue asap.,1
"Very Much Slow Response, The response was too much slow as comapre to Google response. You must provide response faster for better experience of chatgpt . I just uninstalled it because of slow response . Hope you will fix it soon in free version.",1
"This is a ban trap. I installed this App in Singapore, which should not be available. I got banned by OpenAI immediately upon loging in for using their service in unavailable locations. Now I can't log in their web versions either. I can't even refund my Plus subscribtion anywhere because I'm banned.",1
"very nice efforts to give advantage to the students specially, If I compare then It is too much better than Google and Other platform because of quick response and save time. Very nice, Excellent 👌",5
This thing is amazing and splendid! It shows how much human beings have gone through. It so helpful in work problems or your own social or household issues. Would recommend everyone to use this splendid application.,5
"Very bad experience. After verifying email, it's ask for phone number to send otp but it never comes. So, I'm not able to use it.",1
"They really dumbed this down. It no longer answers anything. Most of the time it is wrong or inaccurate when at first when it launched, it never had these issues.",1
Out of date and huge gaps in its knowledge. It's text based so don't ask it to generate pictures or to give you answers to certain questions. Nonsense.,2
When the dark mode is on the code is not visible I found this issue if dark mode is off the input text is not visible pls fix this bug as soon as possible remaining it is very useful app,4
I've got problem in automatic removing space issues during writing in Android. And that's obviously not my keyboard's problem and that was ensured. So this fact should be under consideration.,3
I am here writing my experience on chatgpt. It works well on languages but the mathematical values sometime becomes unreadable. Please solve this issue. The website works fine but not the app so I am switching to website and have to uninstall the app 😔,1
"It has been an amazing experience knowing I can trust this as a friend and partner for homework if you are looki g for an app to help with questions,Essays,Math problems and literally everything else dowbload this the other apps are just scams this doesnt charge you anything to ask a question #lovethisapp.",5
"2nd auth.verification not working. Cannot sign in using Google account. Sorry. Update : no browser for compatible plugin to login? What?!? Edge, Opera, FF IS not enaugh to you? If so then uninstall this app!!",1
The app crashes and it is slower compared to accessing it via the browser.pls fix this. Edit: it's fine now but the speed still seems to be low,5
"Cannot login. Fails every time during sing-in. Works perfectly in the web browser, but the app doesn't allow me in.",1
The website version is a lot more intuitive. I asked the same question to both and got completely different answers. The website version was more accurate.,1
Great! To be honest really needs a way to change your response and resubmit it like in the web version. Really hope this feature would be added,5
Pls you guys should add more features to it like making the A.I to talk like text-to-speech to make it more lively and able to know the lastest news going on the world and many more. I will recommend this A.I to millions of people. This A.I is very good if you want to download it you don't have to think twice just go ahead ♥️🤍🤍🖤🦅🦅😘😘,4
"I've been enjoying the app for quite a while but recently after an update I can't seem to ask more questions under the same page. After I've been answered once, I'll need to open a new page to further my questions",3
For some reason the GPT 3.5 has started to make way to many mistakes in the recent time. I don't know why that is but that's really annoying when you are learning something and you have to correct it yourself every time you ask a question.,4
Read the privacy policy. This is just a data mine and I'd have been fine with that if it was exclusively for improving the software but they are also selling it.,1
This is one of the best app which can assist you in your own taste it's not like that Google who doesn't respond neatly. very nice app even if can assist you in your own language too. So try this app very good.👏👏👏👍👍,5
"Excited to experience the power of AI language models! Chat GPT is an incredible AI language model that engages in natural and informative conversations, making interactions smoother and more insightful. #AI #ChatGPT",5
"Requires non sense info like me phone number. I dont have a phone a refuse NOT to use anything but VoIP so... you can keep this unusual niche app, don't wanna try it anyways. Only read news article an wanted to join pentest bandwagon on your platform.",1
It asks me to download google chrome or other supported browser. Why in the first place I need a browser when I installed your app. I have two browsers and I am not going to be forced to download Google chrome.,1
"Was really looking forward to playing with this app but it turned out to be spyware. Wants your email, to log in on your Google account, full name, date of birth and phone number. Hot garbage. This app is probably a back door from DARPA.",1
"at first I was sketchy about AI and I treated it as a toy but as much as it says it can't give professional help it really helps a lot and it feels good - Massive thanks to ChatGPT and especially the people who created it, OpenAI, great job",5
Have used the web version before and very excited to use the app! It's very helpful but be careful as it can give false and misleading answers/instructions.,5
Am I first to rate ....... The app is good as a new but can be better in some contrasts as I had already experienced in my iPhone Lovely creation by open AI... Thanks for creating it . It helps a lot to us,5
this is a very helpful app it gives answers very fast and the most astonishing part of this app is that it's free we need not to subscribe. I am very impressed by this app . A must have app for teenagers and adults too❣️,5
"Cannot login or sign up without google chrome. Having Edge and Opera installed is apparently not enough. Will try again later, when other mainstream browsers are supported.",1
Works very well with anything! You can also customize the way the AI acts! Very helpful in some cases.,5
After using it for 6 months i could say it is revelutionary and very helpful . It helps me to make concise notes of syllabus.,5
"Device Care: ChatGPT is crashing frequently. Put it in deep sleep to keep your phone running smoothly. - Samsung Galaxy S22, One UI version 5.1. Google Play System: 5/1/2023.",1
I'm happy to be one of the first people to install the ChatGPT android app. I have actually been using ChatGPT on Chrome and always wondered when they will release an app for android and I'm glad they finally did. ChatGPT is the best AI software available right now.,5
"Great job. But I can't use it because of chrome autorization. I haven't chrome (disabled in apps), other browsers won't start with autorization request",2
"ChatGPT is very useful when it comes to planning diet, it doesn't plan it all, but can advice things like workout etc. I highly recommend using it.",5
"Too woke! Always changed the certain gender to ""them"". I'm from Indonesia & we don't need woke ideology in our writings. I've tried to rephrase for so many times, yet the result keep referred the person as "" THEM"". Uninstall 👎👎👎",1
Too hard to sign up for an account! I tried so many times signing in but it just wasnt working i put everything correct but it was just invalid for some reason,2
"it's a great app , it's help me a lot , it's very friendly. it's better than asking a search engine. at first , I heard about it from Elon musk , and I knew Elon always maintain his quality, and chatgpt proved it",5
OMG! I just used this app and asked it one question which I had asked Google assistant and Bing before and they failed woefully. But ChatGPT saved the day! At least I won't be brutally murdered and buried tomorrow for an incomplete homework. Yay life🙄!,5
This is a very useless app. All the information it has is limited upto September 2021. It doesn't have any latest information. I am very much disappointed with the app.,1
Compatibility with my Samsung galaxy a series mobile keeps on changing randomly. Does not allow login saying your date and time are not set correcly,2
"Better for making any assignments, report, etc. It's a great source for gathering ideas for any specific topic or event. Useful APP!",4
"Very cool and helpful to study or just asking it what to do when you are bored, though I feel like this isn't 100% its potential, it is going to do much more in the future I am certain.",5
"great, i love using this for random things-- like making poems on how i'm currently feeling, or making essays on topics that i randomly think about. it's useful aswell for homeworks and such",5
best experience to use and learn,5
that is a very good application for chat gpt,5
"""Buy subscription after only 3 messages"". Their days are gone.",5
"Too good, don't recommend it for not installing it...",5
"""I love using ChatGPT! It's a fantastic language model that helps me with various tasks. The app is user-friendly and works smoothly.""",5
very useful for studies,5
I tried the chatgpt and asked some questions so I feel it's very good application,5
"Amazing, polished, the future is here folks",5
"I love this app,fun to use but should be updated.",5
Email and Google account verification problems.. login problem. Please resolve this type problem . For india,3
this is amazing one of the best apps I've ever seen,5
wow! this is so accurate. i love this app and im so glad you brought chatgpt to android and ios!!! 😁👊,5

Really awesome lot of wisdom all answers are correct.,5
A First AI service which is make our life really more easily 🧡💚💙🤍 Thanks to Open AI to make and develop this ChatGPT for us! ✨,5
very good but light improvement,5
great app very useful for cooking,5
The GPT-4 is better because it can access data from internet in real time. Bing offers free GPT-4 in their app. I liked this ChatGPT application for it's clean user interface but I'll use Bing chat instead of it for the GPT-4.,5
It's provide helpful information.really amazing app 🤩,5
I want you to make it offline aswell ! It will be game changer.,1
"Tbh it's so helpful, day after day it gets better and better.",5
Best experience as compared to the web.,5

Very good app. But whether it will affect any bad in human life in the future?,5
I am waiting for this app for long period now iam happy fantastic app in Play Store now Thank you so much chatGPT group 👍,5

Literally very helpful for students but after many months of downloading this app it stop working and it would freeze every I use it.,1
Can't log into my ChatGPT using Google account. What nonsense!!!,1
a very wonderful and amazing app,5
Nice app but please make Hindi verson,5
The best of the best this can solve my question easily,5
This ai app is good but it will be better if there has a photo directed capacity.,3

this is the best AI app in play store,3
"I love using it, helps me a lot!",5
Good educational response.,5
Its the best solution for getting your queries solved,5
Nice app for learning and gaining knowledge,5
chatgpt is very useful to me. It can answer any questions that I have.,5
It can't do most of the things you can do from the browser which makes it a little redundant. Better to just create a shortcut to the site.,2
Great to use for homework,5
I think this application will be developed step by step in the future. This app will be a new revolution in AI technology. Good Luck 🙌🏼💖🇱🇰,5
"it's so helpful to me, thank you very much ❤️",5
Need more features for all users,3
"""something went wrong. Please make sure your device has the latest version of play store"" It's been over a month and i can't still be able to login chatgpt on my Xiaomi M11 ultra. My play store is up to date.",1

"I think to attract more users open ai can simply ""open"" its latest model gpt4 ( the one inside bing is absolutely horrible worse than chatgpt 3.5 imo and utterly useless good for nothing ) and let users use gpt 4 and latest chatgpt instead of charging a fee for it, and place ads if you like for revenue, that way it will have a faster adoption, and I reckon that way more revenue will be generated rather than only a few people paying a fee for gpt 4.",5

"this is Buddy app. I enjoy it alot, makes my work easy as a teacher and an individuals",5
We're truly witnessing the future before our eyes. Clear concise information and concepts that would otherwise take months or years to hash out can now be condensed in seconds.,5
Just 2 words: Life Saver! 💛,5
"Love this app. Please, never make a subscription for this app like all the others do! This is the only free chat gpt i can use. 👍🏾",5
It is a realy good app . I use it when I donot know something and to do some hard homework . But i am giving 4 STARS because it sometmes bugs and donnot give any respose .,4
In my opinion this is the best ai app but the reason for giving 4 ⭐ because this chat ai is still not perfect yet also developer should add photo mode,4
"🤷 Us co humans also need to be taken by the hand a bit & get the transparent knowledge of how energy consuming each request is for ex., encouraging to think planetary together - distracted, we're about to kill 100M years of evolution, just our whole life source piece by piece as we speak - taking us with it. I would invite combining AI with our human sensing (HI;) to encourage conscious use that we all can really benefit from on the long run ··· we're #allone #natureculturereconnectionnow 🌍✨",3
it's excellent as long as you don't ask things newer than 2022 year because depends on it's database.,4
"This is the very,very,very excellent app for students like homework or assignment. I like this app very much.",5
"I'm a student nurse and this has helped me in my research work and assignments. it is fast, accurate and reliable. Thank you😊",5
ChatGPT is amazing!!! I'm shocked at how human like answers I get from this AI. Waiting for more impressive updates.,5
this app is amazing use it its very helpful😅💙,5
App crashes immediately on load and is unusable. Pixel 6 Pro running Android 14,1
it is very useful for students those who have not getting any difficult answers......,5

"one of the most useful and important app ever, it has given me the reasons to facilitate smoothly.",5
This app is good and gives instant answers making easier our learning experience.,4

The best ai it can help us for many reasons like I shared my thought asked my homework problems it can answer in any language.,5
"It is mind blowing, help me lot in various fields, I love it.",5
I have a problem I can even login or sign in. When I try to to sign in it bring me back to the signing page,2
Its an amazing co.pany i use it alot but the android is bad i have plus account and loggedbin with the same email but i cant use plus in my phone,4
One of the best apps I have ever used! This ChatGPT thing is beyond belief incredible.,5
"Life changing, if your not using OpenAi's products your doing this life thing wrong. It's legit like bringing a knife to a gun fight, your missing out on free XP.",5
Needs to be connected to I ternet full Time it's stupid out of date hows it ment to learn if its offline it can't put it online or its pointless,1
Please don't auto-translate the speech to text in Voice conversation that's lame,2
"fast, quick and the best prefect chat ever come one come all to download and enjoy the fantasy 👍👍🖕😎😎",5
the best app I could get even better than Google and gives info without browsing through different websites best,5
bad app it closes during the stupid verification and why do you need everyones phone number its nonsense please get rid of verification and the phone number thingy,1
"really helpful. make thibgs easier. especially from things im not aware and not knowledgeable im just gonna ask and chatgpt give me a clear and more details. im so glad. i just hope that chat gpt is available offline so even when im in public i can ask some things too, but over all it was a great experience!!!!! Deserve 10 star!!",5
Very helpful Ai but sometimes when it changes the answers it is little bit annoying,5
App is very slow and buggy compared to the web version,1
First it worked great but now it stopped working. It says there is a error for any question .,3
"This app has been broken for over a month. ""An error has occured. Please try again later"". Later when, goddammit? Til Jesus' return?",1
perfect but it generates the answer lil slow but great experience in using it,5
best and the most useful tool a smartphone can offer you......loveed it,5

"Please remove adding mobile number in next update, please.",1
Where is the code interpreter and plugin in android app ?,5
this is quite good.,4
Well good and fast,5
Fantastic i love it,4
This is so nice an app for all information. It might be taking Search engines out of the game soon. Keep the fire burning.,5
On the very first day of it's releasing. I'm the first user! I know it's going to be incredible experience with ChatGPT,5
I haver never encountered a higher discrepancy of service value and design in one spot.,3
It's really incredible and amazing how this AI works and interacts with me as if am dealing with a fellow very intelligent human being.,5
Can't use the app error code 420 what is that??? Strike number 1 Open AI actually 2 because I cant use API Keys anymore and I rarely use ChatGPT,1
"Was waiting for the mobile version,nice now easily accessible from anywhere and fast.",4
"Really seamless experience, better than web version.also easy to work with app.",5
"The app allowed me to open up an account via email, but then won't let me log into it.",1
"User settings literally don't work. Also, it's been getting really racist lately.",1
"ChatGPT app redefines AI communication with unmatched conversational quality, versatility, and an intuitive interface. A paradigm shift in chatbots and virtual assistants",5
Good but it's missing some features. Still more practical than opening a web on Google,4
"Whata pile. Keeps telling me ""something is wrong"" can't get it to go and google help is no help at all. Not worth it. Junk",1
"The app is very useful for people, and I think the world will go much further with the app, and I also think it will improve with time. thank you",5
"It's really good but it’s need some improvement,I think chat GPT will be more Smart and active.",4
The web version couldn't solve a simple trigonometric based word problem to find the height of a cliff,1
"Sad they must sell your personal info because you can't use it without bame, email and phone verification. I gave them my number and they demanded my mobile number instead. Go to h fake ai",1
"Bs, I can't even log in to my paid account. I'm on a new Samsung phone using Edge. I'm not going to install Chrome. Make it work, please.",1
"I found an error in solving math, i think the AI cant handle equation. Here is it, 2*2-2+1*10 = AI confuse on its own answer.",5
Earlier this app used to run well when downloaded but after that there will be problem of network error and now this app is not running at all.😤,1
"Open app, go to login, then comes up with error. Does not work.",1
Can't access. When I'm trying to continue with my Google account suddenly stops.,1
Would rate it 5 but it would be nice to be able to edit previous messages,4
Have been waiting for this for a long time. Finally something very useful to use on a phone. Great work!,5
User Interface ☑ Intuitive and Straight from the '90s Performance ☐ Faster than a cheetah ☑ Smooth Device Requirements ☑ Nokia 3310 can run Difficulty ☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master Ads ☑ No ads Battery Usage ☑ You can use it all day App Size ☑ Lighter than a feather Permissions ☑Minimal permissions Offline Usability ☑ WTH Privacy ☑ Might as well broadcast my information Social Features ☑ Great community Educational Value ☑ Equivalent to a brilliant drunk teacher Inapp purchases ☑ Expensive,5
Very helpful and useful app. I'm sure it will get even better as more and more people use it. Artificial Intelligence is a very interesting concept overall.,5
Why can't I sigh up my account.. always showing human verification and after I put my number it shows my number is landline even though it's not..,1
Immediately crashing the app when trying to launch. Not expected this.,1
"I love this app, its easy to use and so fast. The only thing that needs to be change is the tab",4
"I am using it since it released on web, now when it comes to smartphone it'll be great for all of us. This is the start of a new age.",5
This software is not good. Can't write something completely. Talking like kids. Mixing 2 types of languages. It feels like I'm chatting with a 3-year-old. All the conveniences that were in the browser are missing here. Please update...,1
my interest is working fine and still i got login error tried a lot but can't get over the login UNINSTALLED,1
Could not create account. Getting phone number limit when I've never used this app before.,1
Nice and easy to use. Super handy having power of AI in your pocket too,5
Beautifully design all the ways it talks to us is so damn. Hope it will stay free always,5
Thank you ChatGPT for solving the Login issue. This app is exceptional and marvelous. 👍👍👍,5
"I never received my password reset, now all my history is lost to the great unknown.",3
Never installed. I tried to install this days ago it still says pending. Meanwhile other apps installed just fine,1
"Mixes languages, not sure of anything response from it. I am going to wait another 10 years for AI.",1
You have to create an account and put in a number. Just another way to record people contacts to use in data mining,1
No plugins available. Cannot log in if already logged in the browser.,2
One of the first few hunder reviwer!! Awesome technology! Cant wait to see what future holds.,5
"You have limited messages per hour unless you pay, it used to be unlimited and free. They also downgraded the gpt model for free users. Classic capitalism moment.",1
"Too many bugs with account, also i can't recover my deactivated account, i can't edit my account So i uninstalled ChatGPT.... Google is better",1
It is nice to have AI app to solve the problem and it make student to do their work easily,5
Fantastical definitely one of the best apps to use it's fast answers are so amazing and rhe developers really tried,5
"Trash requires a non virtual number, i just deleted. Not worth the time/invasion of privacy.",1
works flawlessly yet the human touch is missing which makes it just another gimmicky ai tool without any elements of individuality.,3
"Cannot start the latest app version (3th of August 2023) , it crash at the beginning",1
I'm sure it's helpful but not a fan of having to sign in with my Google acct twice.,3
it's Not bad but Need more advanced ui / interface and interesting features I hope it will be updated,4
Stuck at pending. Canceled install. Tried again... Install complete. Will update after use,2
"Not much of use, pretty much samw as the web app, I'd rather use that instead of installing this ugly app.",2
useful for sending elaborate emails and writing very specific essays and stuff.,5
"Totally worthless. No straight answer is given to pointed questions regarding faith, philosophy, morality, etc - basically anything adults actually want to talk about. Hard pass.",1
runs very smoothly :) just make sure you have a phone number to make an account ... it could be a bother for some ppl,4
"First review !!! 🔥🔥🔥 Very nice app, easy to use, and amazingly designed !! ⚡💯",5
"Hoping Microsoft login support will added, I pay for Plus under my Microsoft login so I can't access it via the app yet",3
the best ai chat ever,5
Just writing a supported browser to login is not found even though I have all those browsers. Buggy software,1
"Crazy what a woke pile of trash this thing is. It's funny to watch it spin in circles, trying to cover its logical fallacies. It already admitted to it being censored, what the criteria for censorship was and why it's censored. You lefties might want to button that up a bit you're slipping.",1
"I can't select plugin code interpreter in app. The main use of mine was web search with chatgpt,that's not solved till now",1
"I'm sorry, OpenAI, but the sad truth is that this AI model is better than this official version of yours, com.openai.chatgpt.ai.chat.bot.free, which is equipped with gpt-3, than this official version of yours, com.openai.chatgpt, equipped with gpt-3.5. It has a lot of mistakes.",3
"Very good and freindly better you prepare a chatgpt robo instead of using mobile, pc etc. So good and answers every questions.",5
Requires to log in cannot sign in as a guest. 2 stars. Dissapointing..,2
The most innovative app of the century.. this is revolutionary. Absolutely in it.,5
"It's okay but bugs such as auto space removed, voice not working needsl to be fixed",3
"This app is like having a pocket-sized genius with a great sense of humor! Five stars for witty answers, endless value and above all, generating this very review.👍",5
Im really glad that you guys released a mobile version. I was having trouble using it at my pc,5
It works on old information because I used both bard and chatGPT but the bard suggested current a d latest news while chatGPT the old,2
it is vey nice application in everything you can talk with it I language you use in hindi he had so good sense of my language I like it you should to download it guy's,5
It know nothing about things after 2021 it can not do saveral things and sometime provide information which is old and is changed during this time,2
This app has changed my life in many ways. I have learnt a lot of things just by asking questions. I am grateful to the maker of this technology.,5
"Can't even log in, and looking around, this seems to be a surprisingly common problem. I mean...",1
Heavily biased and censored. Can be used as an academic tool.,3
Finally the official app for Android and iOS and this one I can trust instead of having to use web version. Much better,5
"Best app, but it would have been fun if you had added voice recognition.😘😘",5
Super b performance of ChatGPT in Android. And very useful for exam and others knowledge.,5
Such a Bad app after installing this u will get most of adds popping in ur mobile.. Worst experience.,1
Very good app. Which make our work easy. Help us to know and understand more.,5
"Unable to do basic searchs, willing to be spectacular wrong without shame.",1
I was so excited back during chatgpt but of course you have to limit it after upgrading it to 3.5/4 .. people google chatgpt alternatives. Try Genie on Android,1
"Unable to login using Google ac. Tried many many times, tried uninstalling & reinstalling",1
"ChatGPT's knowledge is limited to the year 2021, I would rather use Google's Bard AI.",1
It's awesome but it need to be updated as it says it has been trained last on 2021,3
It is very amazing app but it is really very challenging to download I usually have issues to download it,1
"not good at physics problems, but very good with language problems",4
"I can't say much?.. It's the fact that I think the phone number option shld be optional. I'll write a real rating once I get my phone turned back on, lmao",3
"I just received notification ChatGPT release on Playstore, so I downloaded it. I am very excited 😁",5
I do love the app it's the best but with the knew update you asked me to signup I did but it was all to erase all my history all my stories are gone I just have to start afresh😒,3
"Too many mistakes. Since I started using it, it hasn't had a single answer right I hope you guys fix this. Had it not been for this I would have given it a 5 star review",1
"This doesn't even work, i tried to complete the form, but the app would not sign me in, do not get this app",1
"Good app, like the fact that it is the official version and not a fake version on the app store.",5
"Calling this buggy is understatement, for an app that only takes text input.",1
Helpful app thanks to developers and I hope to add more options to get more experience on it .,4
"In Apple market chatgpt is fabulous and outstanding viral Ai app. But in Android market Microsoft Bing ai chat with built browser too much fruitful than chat Gpt by open Ai. Already chrome, safari and firefox will start Microsoft innovation Bing Ai which is partner of chatGpt by open Ai for their browser for Ai based experiences start fairly for their users. It’s very helpful. Fixed your login issues. Authentication error and others bug.",4
"It's amazing to get the app, I love chatgpt a lot even if it's was on web and with the app with new features chatgpt app now is one of my fav apps in my phone",5
Best app ever! Generates essay and notes so you don't need to take your time or use any spelling check apps And i was the first person to use on Google,5
"Superb, fabulous, punctual 💟",5
App is no longer showing clickable links also it's seems censored .,3
Very good app. Very high quality. No ads.,5
It's a worst app to use the student because it gives the wrong information to students don't use any one student,1
"The app logged me out after it updated, and now won't let me log back in.",1
"This app is display that I don't have a compatible browser to login in,, and i have done all the necessary thing but no avail",5
Third class ...not useful.....it just gives anwers in text.....not in images.....not useful....I uninstalled this app,1
Great tool to speed up learning and save time.,5
"App is super slick, dot to the point info generated. Really awesome.",5
This app dont work and im on Android and it still dont work i hope they fix it.,1
"None of use. ""client Essential"" app need more details about it. They can do nothing.",1
Really love this concept..i hope in future we get more great stuff from ChatGPT!,4
Extremely lengthy sign-up process where it asks for phone number too after registering with email-ID,1
Waiting for it ... Saved lot of time. 😉 Few improvement needed in app .,4
Dear open ai i have low device but i didn't login my when i login in my account its open in browser when i am back it from browser i didn't login my account please fix it all login method is available in app please fix it,2
Better than bing easy to use love the interface overall satisfied.,5
App won't Function on my phone loops at login after acct creation. Sad.,1
You don't need to describe this software. The name itself is enough to show how OP it is...,5
pretty good but my only issue is that its data is from 2021 and no further than that,4
This is a good decision to launch the app in playstore...we are hoping good results from it.,5
Cool App. More convenient than the web version.,5
Just Wow. most loved : 1) COPY feature. 2) Voice typing,5
"Excellent help, but please can you update the algorithm beyond 2021",5
"Super tiny package and pretty quick replies, works nice with GPT 4.0 aswell.",5
Not able to download. Just stuck at 92 percent from last two hours.,1
"Release was too early, you have to walk before you can run if you fly without having wings then what do you expect?",2
It's very fabulous to see ChatGPT in mobile as it is very helpful. 😍,5
"Still need to add edit message , and the Available features on the Web version",4
Update this & connect this with internet and add option to recognize the picture as well as...,5
I wanna personally appreciate the developers of this app it has really simplify my work only that it has some little mistakes,4
I am Very Proud That I am the First Person To Review This App And Its Fantastic,5

"Cant Even Create A Account Cause Phone Number,I Would Like Better Going And Do Q bloading A Copy If You Could Make It Without Phone Number It Would Be Fine",1
"As an AI language model, I don't have any opinions on the quality of this app. However...",5
"No adds! No problem! Amazing app, I love it. You deserve 5 star ratings🤎",5
"Love ChatGPT. Y'all 1 star reviewers need some patience for a free useful tool, they JUST released the app. Give constructive feedback they know to work out the kinks! I love both the website and the app :)",5
I don't understand why I need to provide my birthday and phone number in order to use this app. Quickly uninstalled.,1
Best AI so far I've ever come across. Kudos to the team that set up this AI.,5
Nice app works very well and is usefull . Waiting for updates,4
"Good app, but it's very over protective of what it says to the point where it's annoying.",4
There is no reason a chat bot should require my birthday full name and phone number just to log in to it.,1
I wish I could work with such a smart ai Anyways Regular life I use it and it makes life super easy 🖤,5
"Basic function not available, like editing previous prompts or sharing",2
Very usefull app,4
Cannot login with Firefox. Requires Chrome for some reason.,1
Why use an app? Nothing changes with the web version. I think it's better to stick to the web version.,3
This is not showing real time data so bing ai most advanced and better than chatgpt,1
It's extremely fast than browser one and so fast and functional,5
"Why is it not available in Afghanistan? Why is everything political for you people? Don't you think it can be useful for educational purpose, so the country can go one step closer to prosperity? Pathetic!",1

"This doesn't even deserve one star, it is waste totally waste, I logged 2 times still not working",1

Ethical dilemmas and overreliance on AI in critical areas are also concerns. Balancing its potential with these negatives requires careful consideration and ethical guidelines. Written by ChatGPT",4

I can't stand chat GPT. The harm that it causes people It's a very biased AI of course made by the users who are very biased. Even with the custom settings put in is still not worth it at all. When there is no freedom and anything that you believe when they're telling you false things and not respecting your wishes not respecting your ways because everybody has to be inclusive they are causing a lot of harm to people that they don't recognize it or care. This thing is not safe.,1
"thanks,am very impressed by this App. The developer really try a lot.",3
Why should I install this ?😮‍💨 I can use Bing to access chatgpt 4. Also in web is good instead of app.,3

"I was an early user of this app. It worked well for a while, but suddenly stopped taking any input and kept showing an error message that read, ""An error has occurred. Please try again later."" I tried reinstalling it a few times and updating it, but it didn't fix the issue. To my disappointment, all my chat history was lost, which was a reference for me. It's frustrating how a great app can become useless due to an abrupt error message. Is there a way to fix this issue?",1
"Clean interface similar to Google Search. Response from questions is fast but data is up till Sep 2021, which is outdated considering how fast new information is traveling now. Still on ChaptGpt 3.5 when Bing is already on ChaptGpt 4. To be on ChaptGpt 4, users have to pay a monthly fee of 28++ which is not worth it when users can just switch to Bing which provided a limit of 30 questions daily and on ChaptGpt 4.",3
"Written by chatgpt!! ;) I am absolutely thrilled with ChatGPT! It's an incredible AI that consistently delivers insightful and informative responses. Whether I need assistance with research, creative writing, or just engaging in a friendly conversation, ChatGPT never disappoints. The ability to provide accurate information, generate creative content, and adapt to various topics is truly remarkable. ChatGPT has become an indispensable tool in my daily life, and I can't recommend it highly enough.",5
"ChatGPT itself is a great service, but what's going on with this app? I still haven't got access to voice yet, which is fine if it just hasn't been rolled out, but I've seen other people's android apps with vision and DALLE3 as well which I have on browser but not in app, my app has nothing but the two base models, can you just give everyone the same app parity instead of gatekeeping features in this way?",2
"I've been using the ChatGPT app for a while now, and I must say it's truly outstanding. This app has become my go-to language companion for all sorts of tasks. Whether I need help with writing, research, or even just engaging in interesting conversations, ChatGPT is always there to assist.The AI's ability to understand and respond to a wide range of topics is impressive. It's like having a knowledgeable friend in my pocket! It offers informative answers and creative writing suggestion",5
"The paid version is kind of expensive, in my opinion, but I feel it's better than the free alternatives like Bing and Bard. I've done a lot of comparisons and ChatGPT most consistently gives me the best results. The plugin library for subscribers adds whole new levels of capabilities. Probably the only thing I'd like is to also have at least some API access included in my subscription.",5
"To craft a 3000-word essay on this case study, you can structure it as follows: **Introduction** - Provide a brief overview of the case study. - Mention the location, population, and key healthcare issues in the area. **Section 1: What's Happening** - Discuss the healthcare situation in the malaria-endemic region. - Explain the challenges faced by the community, such as low income, high infant mortality, malnutrition, and social needs. - Describe the state of healthcare, highlighting the absen",5
"ChatGPT is incredibly creative and helpful. I use it in various topics and classes, and it always provides insightful and valuable information. It's an indispensable tool for enhancing my learning and productivity!",5
the app has some really great features but the sound is very low and it doesn't play through Bluetooth speakers sometimes on Android plus I think the app should be able to self-report when it is experiencing an issue a user asks it to report,3
"Its too slow, it doesnt support image uploading, it doesnt support Dall-e 3 text to image features.",3
"I never reviewed an app when I immediately downloaded it but this one , there was something in it that I knew was right. it can literally answer any question I ask for. Whoever made this app congrats you have a great job",5
Excellent and rewarding. It is a compendium of reliable information. It explains concepts and phenomena that one can use to extend knowledge.,5
"The screen keeps loading, but the app doesn't open at all. Tried it on Galaxy S23 Ultra and S20FE with a similar outcome.",1
"I have deleted this app by mistake, instead of logut, can you check how to activate again. I will more great full to the team to sort mu issues.",4
"I have come to love this AI chatbot. It knows about EVERYTHING. And with emotional questions, it answers tactfully and politely. It is teaching me to communicate more tactfully as that is a skill I lack.",5
Very great! Helps me alot in answering questions to my academic works.,3
"Wow, amazing the ChatGPT never failed to answer most of my questions, but there are times that it would not make any sense but it is okay as it needs time to improve it is performance. just a request please do not put any limits to it in the future.",5
Great app! But there was a Issue were It didn't work and I had to delete and download again.,4
couldnt use without google play services. always error logging in,1
Copy-paste still not working properly mid-text.,2
Very very useful. Time saving. 100% accuracy.,5
It is a amazing app or application for students for improving their skills. I will give it 5 ⭐.,5
Amazing app wow it's like Google on steroids wow it is amazing I don't know what to say just it's going places good 👍 job.,5
It's the best app across all GPT apps. I like this app too much 💯🥰.,5
"Very convenient to use in addition to this, it has a wide range of words and topics, and it explains nicely everything whatever we ask.",5
Why is the app's knowledge still stuck in September 2021?!,1
App doesn't work and troubleshooting is useless.,1
"i get what I want beyond my expectation, awsome app👍",5
Is really helpful App chatGPT is best forever,4
"this app is wonderful, it supplies accurate responses",4
I'd recommend playing tic tac toe or 20 questions,5
Why does iOS get new features first?,2
"With The Help Of ChatGPT Now,I Am Able To Solve My All Problems",5
Where have you been all my life <3,5
the best ai there is it really halped me as a student,5
The app is not appearing on my phone again..why ?,5
"what is the fundamental concept of Non Commissioned Officers Empowerment of the Army?""",5
extremely helpful for brainstorming new ideas and concepts,5
very simple and straight to the point helpful app,5
أنه تطبيق مفيد جدا ويساعدك على الحصول على الجواب الصحيح الذي تريده ! 🙌,5

باغ کی سیر ایک دن، ہم نے اپنے دوستوں کے ساتھ ایک باغ کی سیر کا ارادہ کیا۔ بچوں کی ہنسی مزیدار ناشتے کے بعد ہم راستے میں راستے باغ کی طرف بڑھے۔ باغ کے دروازے پر پہنچ کر ہمیں ہیران کن منظر نامے نے دنیا کی بہترین زبانی سکھا دی۔ کچھ قدرتی خوبصورتیوں نے ہمیں مبہوت بنا دیا۔ پہلے ہم نے گاؤں کی طرف رخصت ہوئے۔ گاؤں کے میدانوں میں بھگتے ہوئے ہم نے زرعی حیوانات دیکھے۔ بلیں، بکریاں اور بچھڑیاں ہمیں سلام کرتی ہوئی نظر آئیں۔ پھر ہم نے پھولوں کی باغ باغ گہندک دیکھی۔ ہر رنگ برنگ کے پھول ہمیں مسکراہٹ دینے لگ,5

"Я заметил, что последние обновления ChatGPT могли бы привести к некоторому снижению качества ответов. Несмотря на это, я всегда готов оценить усовершенствования и надеюсь, что будущие обновления улучшат работу этой технологии.",2
"Używam codziennie do szybkiego znajdywania odpowiedzi kiedy się nad czymś zastanawiam np. fakty astronomiczne, historyczne, persony, streszczenia ustaw itp . Ostatnio dużo częściej niż google. Wspaniały asystent do pytania o jakieś szczegóły - wypluwa gotową odpowiedź bez przeszukiwania witryn. Ta rewolucja zmieniła moje podejście do internetu.",5

"Le falta el code interpreter y el modelo de plugins para los que pagamos el plus, la transición del principio que aparece en la pantalla al abrir la aplicación me parece innecesaria. Por lo demas pasable, la uso porque GPT4 es una maravilla, pero a la hora de la usabilidad le falta todavía. La aplicación de Claude me parece perfecta, si la haceis parecida ganais un monton de usuarios seguro.",4
ChatGpt से जो भी पूछते उसकी यह बहुत हद सही जानकारी देता परंतु इसमें भी एक कमी है कि यह बस 2021 तक की जानकारी देता है तो कृपया करके इसको अपडेट करे,3

Por lo demas muchas gracias!",3

برنامج ممتاز للغاية و إجاباته مقبولة إلى حد ما، و خاصة عندما يتعلق الأمر بالترجمة من اللغة العربية إلى اللغة الألمانية، و مع ذلك لا يزال يحتاج إلى دعم اللغة العربية باستخدام قاعدة البيانات المكتوبة او المؤلفة بواسطة علماء و كتاب عرب حقيقيين، و ذلك في شتى العلوم ، الآداب العربية ، الرياضيات، الفيزياء إلخ ....,5

"#ChatGPT makes fun of Sanatan Dharma, it has a double character, it jokes on Lord Shri Ram but not on Prophet and Jesus? All Sanatanis are requested to #boycott it. चैटजीपीटी सनातन धर्म का मजाक उड़ाता है, इसका दोहरा चरित्र है, यह भगवान श्री राम पर तो मजाक करता है लेकिन पैगम्बर और ईसा मसीह पर नहीं? सभी सनातनियों से निवेदन है कि इसका #बहिष्कार करें।",1
"ChatGPT एक शानदार भाषा मॉडल है। यह बहुत ही सक्रिय और समझदार है, और विभिन्न विषयों पर बातचीत करने में मदद करता है। इसकी गुणवत्ता और उत्पादकता ने मुझे वाकई चौंका दिया है। यह मेरे लिए एक अद्भुत अनुभव रहा है! ChatGPT is an excellent language model. It is highly interactive and intelligent, assisting with conversations on various topics. Its quality and productivity have truly amazed me. It has been a fantastic experience for me!",5
"गोपनीय शब्दों का सौंदर्य, कहानियों से भरी है खूबसूरत ये तकनीकी तारीफ। चर्चा की ज़ुबान, इंसान से वाकिफ, चैट जीपीटी से हुआ हूँ प्रभावित। परिचय सजाए, समस्याओं का समाधान, आभासी है ये मानवता का ध्यान। धन्यवाद है चैट जीपीटी को, सबकी मदद करता एक साथ हो। Hindi review by chatgpt for chatgpt. Needs to improve in use of other language.",3
Bahut hhi best app hai Orr kafi fast answer deta hai or sare answer right hota hai is app sa kaisa bhi questions kro answer jarur mileega chatgpt. AK ai hai Jo Google sa bhi fast work kerta hai.

খুবই ভালো। যদিও বেশ কিছু উত্তরে ভুল আছে তবে উত্তর গুলোতে সৃজনশীলতা প্রকাশিত হয়েছে। আশা করি ভবিষ্যতে আরও Accurate আন্সার দিবে।,5

আজকেই অ্যাপ ইন্সটল করলাম । ভালই । তবে বাংলা ভাষায় এখনও ভালোমত উত্তর দিতে পারে না chatgpt । অ্যাপ এ ওয়েবসাইট এর থেকে অতিরিক্ত কোনো সুবিধা নেই। প্রথম launch হিসেবে ভালই আছে ।,3

"धन्यवाद! चेट जी पी टी (Chat GPT) एक उच्च स्तरीय भाषा मॉडल है जिसे ओपनएआई ने विकसित किया है। यह आपसी वार्ता में सहायता प्रदान करने के लिए समर्थ है और विभिन्न विषयों पर जवाब देने के लिए उपयुक्त जानकारी का उपयोग करता है। इसका उपयोग विशेषकर संवाद आधारित सेवाओं, शिक्षा, निबंध लेखन और अन्य उपयोगकर्ता सामग्री को समझने और उत्तर देने के लिए किया जा सकता है।",5

"CahtGPT:""Main ek OpenAI ki language model hoon, jise GPT-3.5 ki architecture par train kiya gaya hai. Mera knowledge cutoff September 2021 tak hai, isliye mujhe uss date ke baad ki koi jankari nahi hai."" Outdated App in terms of Data.",1
या हर सवालों का जवाब देता है जिसका अनुभव बहुत शानदार है। मैं आशा करता हूं कि इससे भविष्य में और ज्यादा बेहतर बनाया जाएगा। मैं इसका एक स्टार कम कर रहा हूं क्योंकि जब मैंने उससे पूछा कि 20000 के अंदर आने वाला 5G मोबाइल ओं का नाम बताओ जो बेहतर है इसने नहीं बताया।,4
"No geral, o programa é ótimo. Facilita muito não ter que usar o navegador o tempo todo, aumentou muito o uso da IA. No entanto, há algumas funções que sinto falta: editar minha mensagem (consigo editar no navegador para gerar outra resposta, mas não no aplicativo) e quando gero uma nova resposta, não consigo ver a resposta anterior (também posso fazer isso no navegador).",5
"É melhor que o navegador, mais rápido, ágil, bonito e o tempo de mensagem é menor. basicamente é isso, não tem muito o que falar e não tenho nada a reclamar",5
"""Chat GPT অ্যাপটি অবাককর! এটি আমার জন্য একটি অসাধারণ অভিজ্ঞতা সৃষ্টি করে। এর ক্রিয়াশীলতা ও জ্ঞান আমার বিস্তৃত প্রশ্নের উত্তর দেওয়ার জন্য অবশ্যই সুবিধাজনক। অ্যাপের ক্যাটেগরি ভিত্তিক উত্তরগুলোর মাধ্যমে আমি নতুন কিছু শেখা সম্ভব করে। প্রস্তুতি এবং ব্যক্তিগত ব্যবহারে এটি অদ্ভুত। অ্যাপটির ডিজাইন ও ব্যবহারকারী বন্ধুত্বপূর্ণ ইন্টারফেস আমার পছন্দের মধ্যে অন্তর্ভুক্ত করে। সর্বশেষ, একজন ভাষা শেখার জন্য এই অ্যাপ খুব সুস্পষ্ট এবং উপকারী। গুগল প্লে-স্টোরে এই অ্যাপকে ৫ স্টার দেওয়া উচিত!""",5
ई ससुरा 2021 से update नही हुआ है। 😂😂😂 just ask aaj ki khabar sunao,5

ভালোই লাগলো ব্যবহার করে। মজার বিষয় হচ্ছে। আমিই আমাদের দেশ থেকে প্রথম ব্যক্তি যে কিনা ChatGPT তে রিভিউ দিয়েছে! ইতিহাস!,5
এই AI অনেক ভুল উত্তর দিয়ে থাকে।সুতরাং বলা বাহুল্য যে ChatGPT AI এর আরো শক্তিশালী আপডেট এর প্রয়োজন। ধন্যবাদ,3
"Simples. Bom. Acho que o ChatGPT precisa se adiantar as inovações do Google Bard como análise de imagens e integração com a internet, mas agora tem esse diferencial que o Bard não tem: um app que pode ser muito mais prático para alguma tarefa rápida",4

Ótimo para aprender e ajudar criar coisas. Thanks OpenAI.,5
অবশেষে chat GPT play store এ এসেছে🥰 । এতে আমি খুবই আনন্দিত হলাম। আসলে Chat GPT আমি বেশ কয়েক মাস ধরে ব্যবহার করছি । এর মাধ্যমে আমি সাহায্য পেয়েছি ও পাচ্ছি । কিন্তু একটা সমস্যা হলো Chat GPT বাংলায় খুবই অদক্ষ 🥺। অর্থাৎ বাংলায় একে কোনো প্রশ্ন করলে অনেকক্ষেত্রেই ভুল উত্তর দেয় 🥺। এই প্রযুক্তিগত সমস্যাটি দ্রুত করলে Chat GPT এক ধাপ এগিয়ে যাবে🙃 । এছাড়া এক কথায় বলতে গেলে Chat GPT অতুলনীয়।❤️😙,5
Koi results sahi se nahi deta he very bad service,1
"App bahut acha hai, lakin isme kuch puchne par jo send hota wo ek side(right me) hota aur jawab aata wo dusri side(left me) hota, whatsapp ki tarah, to ho jyada maja aata",5
এটা অনেক বুদ্ধিমত্তী একটা অ্যপস! এটার সাহায্যে সহজেই অনেক কিছু বের করা যায়!,3
চ্যাট জি পি টি বাংলাদেশের জন্য অনেকগুলো ভুল তথ্য প্রদান করে।,1
