Good graphics with a very generic base/troop timer upgrade system. The game gives limited information during the opening tutorial and cluttered the screen with a ton of sale items that it blocks your view and cheapens the over all game. Between the cluttered screen none existent story and the standard game play that feels like a copy and paste from dozens of other such games. This wasnt for me. Need to clean up the screen and streamline the game play.,2
"From the starting screen, that filled me with nastolagia, I knew it would be an amazing game. I was right. Not only are the art styles beautiful and the culturally accurate story very enticing, but the gameplay is also spectacular. While in other games, there's only so much you can do in a period of time, you can play forever in this one. It is not pay to win, and the strategic part is definitely there.It's both an easy and challenging game. You choose which. Exactly what I've been looking for.",5
"The lagging is killing me. Every. single. tap. creates the spinning ball of doom. Poor engine design. The graphics are great, but the lack of a dismissal/skip ahead option, is tedious for those of us experienced in strategy games and hate being forced to follow a storyline. All that, I could cope with. But it's the lagging that really wrecks it for me. It's my only phone game that lags. I can't see me playing much at all, at this point. Too annoying to wait up to 30 seconds, after every tap.",2
I've played a few games now that have this exact same format. Started out fun with lots to do and build then BOOM you hit the wall and everything slows down and progress is a chore unless you want to pay to win. Shame because it has the potential to be a great game. I've played too many games and invested time and occasionally money only to see developers cancel the game and you lose all the effort you put into it. Sorry it's just not worth it to me.,3
"About 90 minutes into game and so far I'm impressed with the speed that I can switch through menus from the HUD. Overall, graphics are pretty good (running on medium on tablet), although I'm a very spoiled Elder Scrolls PC gamer so I have pretty insane standards for what gets a 10/10 on graphics. Overall, the story pacing is awesome for an Android game, not too fast, not too slow. I'm HOH so I can't speak to sound or music as I don't use either, but the captioning is awesome!",4
"This has been a fun game. Originally, I began playing it due to affiliation with a game that pays you to play games, but this one I really enjoy because I haven't had to use a single penny! I have been able to progress, though finding all the ways to upgrade your warriors and troops was confusing at first. Too many interfaces. Other than that, Lots of fun!",4
"Cool enough game for medium-to-fast paced strategy. Still miss this type of game in the laid back style of earlier civilization style games that let you build and explore at your leisure without punishing you for it, though there were still plenty of rewards for those who chose the ambitious route...",3
Very soothing and puts your mind to work. But I would do a 9.5 because it take a long time to get in but other than that it is really fun! I would recommend to people who like to be a little challenged 👌.And there's absolutely no adds so no interruptions very addicting hope you enjoy if you install!!👌,5
"Graphics 10/10 Music 10/10 Gameplay 10/10. You can easily play this game for free they give you a tonne of resources and speed up's for free, yes the building time's get longer but that's with any base building game. Micro transactions are fair. Big fan of the game, job well done Devs. My only issue is the app icon would look better if it was just black with logo instead of the trees.",5
"It's annoying, when I start playing and it's in the loading part, it doesn't load and it doesn't enter the game, it just stays in the intro part, I tried to reset the app and re-download but it's still the same, it sucks",1
"I fin this build game pretty good for jumping in and out as you need to build/farm . there's lots to do at first and it grabs you in . this is what I'm finding at the moment anyway. I just wish these games would let you free play and crack on with the game Instead of taking weeks to build a tent ! . I get they do it for the money but not everyone has money to play a game on a 6"" screen at best . but Yeah this is 1 of the better ones I have found",4
It is genuinely fun and pretty easy to do stuff you can play for a couple of minutes and then it works mostly in the background and the music is great especially if you like Viking games and it has voice acting which is pretty decent. 9-10 would recommend,5
"This game is great and I would recommend playing it on newer phones for optimal performance as the game is big and needs space. I've read many reviews of irritated users saying the game is poor quality and is very laggy, those sole reasons mostly trace back to old phones that aren't able to give top performance thus leading to angry users and 2 or 3 star reviews. In all I would suggest giving the game a try and seeing for yourself on how well it runs on your device.",5
"At chapter 26, we need to defeat 10 niflung leaders, it is so frustrating since no tribe members are willing to join the attack and it is compulsary to complete the task to go to the next level. I am very frustrated. I am just stuck because of this option. Other than that i am very impressed by the game play.",2
"I like the gameplay style of this game. But there's a big flaw in the game. An exploited hack allows player to randomly switch from tribe to tribe at any moment. It creates an unfair advantage to larger tribes who create multiple tribes and then switch players between them. This allows them to create a monopoly over the server to control or destroy small newer tribes who don't obey. There needs to be a grace period, perhaps 3 to 5 days, for players to switch between same tribes over and over.",1
"At first I thought it was ugly to play it didn't work it was just a waste of time but of course if you don't try you won't know that's why I tried it and I was surprised that the game was very satisfying because in terms of graphics, gaming experienced, there is a lag issue but it's not that serious, maybe low end devices just can't handle it. Thank you for making this game even though it was just released when the game was obviously The game was very good, that's why I can say this game is 5/5.",5
Pay2Win. It's harder to play events because I got put in a server with mostly foreigners. By the time you get enough info to see that's the case it's too late to go to a different server. Can't participate properly and can't enjoy the game fully because of that flaw. Not being able to play the game properly just because of that is ridiculous.,2
"Very poor. Not explained well? Starts OK, then gets confusing, so you are selecting choices you don't even know you need? Supposed to keep you amused whilst on transport, etc, but you just end up endlessly pressing service buttons for repeat outcomes, to take 19 or 27 hours to build something! Not engaging at all. Wouldn't choose anything by this company again. Advert was misleading, too! Would give 0, but one is minimum.",1
"Very nice to play, but the Law of the jungle event should be more leveled. Low might players against some 15M of might doesnt make it fun to play. Also, some timed quests just have their items disappeared or too far away to be practical to play",3
So far I'm loving this game and loving the open world map. Easy to understand game and goes with the flow start up and of course your always going to hit the slow progress with building and research but apart from that definitely give it a go.,4
The game has great graphics and interesting in the beginning but after you finish 4 village enemies their nothing left to do then collecting the resources and updating your village the game gets super boring after that I have the game in my mobile and now I don't even feel to open the game even if I'm super bored.. The game is dead itself...,3
Didn't get bjorn because none of the other kingdoms wanted to attack and they had no incentive to. Weird how other people's involvement affects your game so much. I'm on track to finish top 80 out of a possible 200 and I won't get anything for it. If you don't spend tonnes of money on the game you'll always be behind,3
"Very good game to play when you have a lot of time to waste..it's a pay to win game, and when you spend a lot of money in the game and have problems with the game there online support are the worst you won't get far with them. They will send you the same email over and over .so basically if you download the game don't spend money please",1
"The graphics is great for a mobile game, the stars are only for that, unlike any other game there is no resource production building in this game so its very very hard to gain resources to upgrade or research or training, which is an huge obstacle for f2p. If you are someone who willed spend money, a lot on my mobile games then opt in.",2
"It's a good game but the troops you need to overcome the enemies as the game progresses is taking way too long of my the players time, it's ez to upgrade the buildings and all but the troops... NO! Plz lower the enemies difficulty or make it easier to raise troops lvl",3
"Can't move foward early on due to being unable (the game will not give the option) to clear the first archer enemies from the gate. It holds all progress hostage. I've only been playing for ten minutes. I'm a game reviewer and I have to say, the is the fastest a higher ranked game has glitched bad enough to prevent progress. Graphics: 7/10 Storyline (what I could get): 5/10 (Will change if ever fixed) Ease of use: 7/10 (not counting the glitch) Fight graphics: 3/10",2
"Despite having several not bad features and being nice overall, the game is wildly imbalanced: if you play it without investments, you can be attacked by players much stronger than you, with an obvious result. It should be noted that it's not only one single random case, but a practice. Of course, you'll be pushed back in development after defeat and will lose part of the interest in this game (once again, the game isn't terrible in many other aspects).",2
I really really really like the gaming format of this game of a simple yet strategic strategy of patiently working to build up resources and experience to become more powerful and defeat the enemies. It is pretty very well laid out and I love that. I just do wish that a different version of this game existed that didn't involve devinations and spiritual power of the magic kind and such. I would love to request one be made but wouldn't know how to get the word through so I'll just leave this.,3
"Extremely tedious and boring 💤 Plus the amount of little red notifications you have click on is insane, it's ridiculous how many there is, it makes the whole game annoying and tedious. After level 10 you get mostly fed up of clicking on little red notifications and it ruins the game. The thought of having to open the game up first thing in the morning, and start clicking on all those little red notifications again all day, makes you simply not want to open the game at all. It's far too much.",1
"It's simply, wonderful, just one feature I would like that would certainly help new players(I had difficulties when I was new), so add some in game tutorial videos like codm have, that helps players to understand the features well. Apart from that it's wonderful game It would have been no. 1 game if you worked on the graphics the way, your video is on Play Store",5
"Please play this game. Far above the other similar games like this with grown-up graphics, fascinating range of challenges that update regularly, excellent activities when in a tribe and, if you want to spend, affordable and rewarding extras. HOWEVER, you really do not need to spend as it allows good progression anyway.",5
"Total dissapointment after around 9 months playing. From being excited in the begin to total disaapointment and what i can read on other portals looks like i am not the only one. During kvk event ppl from CE ZT ( UTC +2) are most neglected ones to make some points and progress. And still so many unsolved issues from before, complete ignorance by developers. Thinking to make a break again - for good this tame. From big pleasure to big waste of my time... one star is way too much.",1
Its got a theme i like and great music but the game itself LAGS HORRIBLY and unbearably. I put up with it for about five levels and i got into it far enougg to see that i would LIKE TO invest more time and possibly money into but in its current state i cant see it having a future at all. The whole thing needs drastic revamping and optimization. Theres a lot of clicking and waiting for stuff that doesnt even need to be taking place.,2
"it is a very nice game a lot like clash of clans but a better version as it has many things to do and many monsters or enemies to attack so you won't get bored. But once you reach cheif hall lvl 21 it is very difficult to upgrade more especially if you are free-2-play as you will be attacked and lose your resources. the remaining resources will be used to train troops. also the research time for t5,t6,t7 troops are very high.",4
Fun game! Not attacked by adds. It appears that you can play for completely free if you want. Or speed up with $ if you choose to. Runs very smoothly also.,5
"Easy to understand, tutorial is descriptive, I just wish you could actually battle instead of just sending a squad. They should see if they can make it more strategic with real battle. Allowing us to decide where our troops go and when they attack.",4
"Strategy game. It was fun at the beginning, but soon you will get bored of the events that were launched by the developer. A game that you can make friends with all over the world, the bad thing was when the strongest tribe controlled the kingdom, conflict/ racist/ arguments/ occur and made you feel tired/ frustrated to quit the game. Some pay to play players are too serious on the game, which will affect the free to play players.",4
Constantly loading...just has loading symbol in the middle of the screen. I looked for support and they give generic answers telling you it's your connections fault even though all other apps and games connect perfectly fine...works fine when I make purchases but won't load properly when I actually want to play. Won't be spending another cent on this rubbish,1
Game has good graphics and interesting gameplay. But higher level players keep attacking you continuously. There is no chance you can defend them. They loot you and you use whatever remaining resources to heal your troops only to be obliterated again by the higher level players. Cannot continue playing like this. Bye,3
Fun but slow. Just started and it limits what you can gather by putting up enemies in the way. So you let's say you need 100 wood to do something they put enemies that need so many troop to beat that take 150 wood to train. So it takes awhile,3
"What a great game, but unfortunately, I come from server 45 where nclr wants full control , and destroying every competition, developers is this the plan?I know people that have quit game step in and do something, I will probably quit soon if nothing changes, I even payed to play but I won't pay anything anymore, till yall fix this problem , there is no peace in kingdom",1
"Good but got annoyed by the fact you can't get rid of the chat at the bottom. If there is a way to get rid of it, I'd definitely start playing again. No ads, tutorial is good, graphics are awesome. Time based not energy based. As soon as I sort the chat thing out I'd increase star rating but settings are the only thing I'm having trouble navigating",3
Don't play this game or waste your money. It's like most... they do not protect the excellent game play in the early levels. Greed and money take over and fare play go out the window. I dropped $200 probably just to find out .... same old same old.,1
"I enjoy the graphics, the story, and the building up of my base, but i think it is ridiculous that literally 10 minutes after starting i was attacked by someone in a clan. Obviously 10 minutes in i am not even in a clan yet, but am getting sacked. Not cool. There should be some sort of limitation to attacking, maybe setting it so only clan members can be attacked.",3
"Graphics, gameplay overall quite good, lots of tasks, missions, battles. However, it is clumsy, difficult to navigate, high clicker. At times difficult to progress. The heros let the game down, very hard to upgrade skills, talents, very difficult to obtain, be warned, no way of protecting yourself from attacks, little rewards, cannot use buildings when being upgraded, eg: can't research or train troops when upgrading building. Needs improvement, no incentives to keep playing.",3
"This game is a MASTERPIECE. Every detail, every mechanics, every rules, everything is way beyond my expectation. There are a lot of players from diverse backgrounds too, great way to make new friends, I'm not even talking about the translator yet. There are also new challenges every once in a while which is exciting. This game makes me feel like a viking everyday. VIKINGS, RISEEEEEE!!!",5
To unlock more characters you have to use hero hall and meat wood and stone are vital its a good game to try out im impressed by the detail and war challenges could have raids but im an amatuer to VR but it has in game strategy which is a new twist i think as long as you are fighting to save villages and recruit new people in your clans it does well in the game,4
"Warning: video ads for this game do not reflect actual game play. The tutorial parts are intuitive, step by step and fun. The art is nice. I like that the female characters are strong, cool and empowered while not being weirdly sexualized. The voice acting accents could be more consistant. I stopped playing a week later because progression slowed down a lot, I couldn't find any tutorials when stuck, and every team I joined was mostly inactive",3
This game is the best for any one who is always bored looking for games to play out there .this one is cool Has a lot of fun quests And anyone can play it it doesn't matter about age or gender it's so fun I don't sleep 😂while playing this game I love it so much you guys have really out done yourself with this new cool game I feel like a good Viking chief who knows how to rule and command and survive and lead,5
"Game is hard to comprehend and makes no sense at times. How I can have an army of 16,000 soldiers and can't use them to level is nonsense. I quit playing because I couldn't level because Viking Rise wouldn't let me use the soldiers that had finished training.",2
"I enjoyed playing this game for a few weeks, but now it’s become unplayable. I’m constantly attacked by the same person every day, and tens of thousands of my troops have died. It costs millions to heal them. It takes days to collect enough resources to heal your troops, but by the time you collect enough resources, you’re already being attacked multiple times and you start all over again. For the past week, all I’ve been doing is collecting resources and healing my troops. Deleting this game.",2
"Fun & frustrating. This game isn't as p2w as most in this genre. There are still the high level cashers to deal with, but a lot of people participate & contribute without spending much or anything at all, & still have fun. There's a ton of info to keep up with at first. Of course, it's not all readily available in game after being explained just once. Unfortunately, it's not all found with a Google search, either. There are plenty of guides & tutorials, but good luck sifting through all that.",3
"Oh my gosh I love playing this game! I have fun with a balance of idle and strategy civ game that is visually appealing, graphics are available for low-end devices and the experience isn't grueling without p2w.",5
As with most games there is a learning curve. Still learning and growing. I have been playing roughly an hour and thirty minutes and totally am sold on this game. I find it to be challenging as well as fun and rewarding. The best Viking game that I have found yet! Go ahead and try it out for yourself.,5
"Another game ruined by multiplayer. This would be great if horrible people weren't allowed to attack you unprovoked and slow down progress. It's a stupid, unnecessary part of the game. Make a single player server so people can actually enjoy the game",1
Awesome game so far. No intrusive ads. In-game purchases if you want buffs. Story line is pretty cool for a flash game. I could see it as a PC game upgraded. Either CandC style or Assassins Creed. Good game. Recommended for the RPGers,5
"I would give this game 5 stars, but I don't like the simple fact I gotta create another account in a different kingdom! In order to escape from other bigger players. Why can't I just move my first account to a different Kingdom to be able to continue growing instead of creating a new account and start over again 😡",2
"The first week I enjoyed it but now I think this game is a joke. It's impossible to keep developing when people with millions power over you constantly attack you and take everything you have. I can't even go gathering resources without my troops getting attacked on the way! I spent the last of my diamonds on resources to heal my troops, now I am completely hopeless to advance in this game. Why don't you make it so you can't attack people that are so much weaker than you? Or some free shield.",1
"Sorry, but this is worse than watching continuous ads. When you collect items it almost takes a minute to collect per item no different to ads. If I could give 0 stars I would. You developers really make me sick.",1
"Game is magnificent, I wish that city can also be teleport to another kingdom, upgrade days must be reduced it's boring to wait upgrades. I hope developers try to reduce numbers of upgrading days/period cause some players will loose interest in game.",5
"I'm not really a Viking enthusiast; however, I find this game quite enjoyable. Nothing is overly complicated, and the game does a pretty good job of explaining everything, unlike some games that are similar to this one. I like the pacing of the game. The graphics aren't great, but it doesn't take away from the overall experience. If you're on the fence, take a chance on this one.",4
"It is not free to play, we either spend money to grow fast, or get dictated to by those that have. They strip the fun out of the game by disbanding our tribes to grow there own, or get attacked and destroyed. How about start a free server with no in game purchases and give everyone the same chances to actually play the game",1
A good game. It has alot to do. It has been keeping me occupied for a while. Although it takes a while to upgrade you're buildings . there for there is a lot of speed up tokens around the base,4
Finally a different and good strategy mobile game. Out of all the dozens if not more that I've played this game trully feels different and makes me wanna play more. Mobile games normally no longer captivates me for the sole purpose that most of them feel the same. This doesn't and that's great!,5
Could be a good game but unless you spend lots and lots of money buying packs the game grinds to a halt where developing is so slow. You can see this in tribes that have lots of members but are really dormant and do not participate. So belonging to a tribe is pointless as nobody helps you develop and they do not join in the rallies. No idea what the developers are trying to achieve apart from trying to make lots of money. Worst of the chat section is becoming very racist and vile,3
"Well, it was fun for about an hour. Then, you get to a circlejerk, where it requires more troops to defeat the enemy, more food to create the troops, and in order to get the food you have to defeat the enemy. No possible way to advance.",1
Good interesting game. A lot of info tobtake in at first but the menus help you keep on track of tasks. Like the armed combat aspect.,4
Misplay not giving full reward. I downloaded through the rewards app Misplay and it's saying that I'm not getting full rewards because the game isn't giving the app full credit. It said it was a high reward game so that's super disappointing.,2
"This is game is best for both p2w and f2p👍 You don't have money to spend no problem! This game is totally free and a lot of fun , Amazing graphics and Battle experience Best of all strategy games ,and when you enter in the game you feel like you are part of community. You can make a lot of friends, enemies and allies it's depend on you. Play the game and have fun🤗",5
Clunky at times. I would like to see a clearer path to upgrade soldiers. And still looking for the button to drop my tribe so I had to start again hope to avoid those bumps and find the right tribe this time,4
"😡😡Everything in this game is great, it just needs to find wood, stone and meat automatically. Not having such a feature is really annoying.😡😡",1
Hello 👋.I give you four star because everything is perfect awesome 🥰 so HD graphics HD game Play ▶️ everything is HD I like the game but please decrease there internet this game need fast internet so please solve them .and troops take so minimum time chief Hall take 2 days so please 🙏🥺🥺 solve this solution please 🙏. I am the ranking player not a small player.. thanks 😊,4
"My experience with this game has been an exceptional one. I'm new to this game, so I'm still learning, but it's super interactive & fun to play! I'll have to check back in once I learn a bit more, but so far i'm really digging this game & I think you will too!",5
"Just another boring ""press build, and wait"" game. Nice graphics, but that's it. Uninstalled after a few days. These games are all the same",2
"Pretty decent all things considered, less begging for money than most games of its kind. Good art and graphics, enjoying it.",4
Just started and so far so good. I just have limited freedom on what I want to do with my village as I have to strictly follow the tasks otherwise I won't have enough resources to complete them if I manage them on my own.,4
Terrible Lag. Almost unplayable after the last update which makes kvk impossible. It is not my connection because i still play RoK flawlessly! IGG response not helpful. Game lags so bad you cannot do anything.,1
I love that there are no incessant ads. It is slow to build up but I am fine with it to avoid ads.,5
I like it. Viking rise is very intertwining! And it's also mind blowing when the things you have get upgrades that is very interesting and cool.,5
"Great game, very addicting and could/have played for hours. So much to do with many great rewards so quickly! This sounds like such an AI comment :/",5
So far I played for a week and it has nvery nice graphics and good level of complexity which is hard to see on mobile phone games.,5
Hello I have problem with disband my tribe when I go to options delete I write delet but nothing happened!! Also if you could make this game more strategy... Because whos high rate his always win !!!,4
Absolutely love the game! The graphics get better and better. There are a ton of events to do so you don't get bored. I got in with a top 5 tribe and their great! We are family. You can spend real money but don't necessarily need to. Big KVK event on now. Lots of rewards to it's great. The video with Peyton Parrish is awesome! If you have any issues you get a response right away. You guys are doing a great job keep up the good work! Skal🍻❤️,5
Great game awesome adventures and very good team play options very good visual experience a few drawbacks paid to win and o yeah loads of updates regularly way to many. has a few glitches particularly the troop marching it's so annoying come on guys fix it. 5 star game but can't give at the moment will review again later stage,4
Absolutely a game that's hard to stop playing Graphics are amazing The only bump in my interaction with the game is that I found myself amongst players on a totally different time zone who speak a totally different language that even when you push the translate button..it's beyond me what they are discussing I am impressed that this game keeps up the maintenance and if you are logged into discord under the Viking Rise chat you get great tips and help for the game,4
"Great game with great team play and graphics, unfortunately though the game has been overshadowed by countless bots and players using scripts to illegally acquire resources. Even when reported,.little to no action is taken against the players in question. It was a great game until this situation was allowed",3
Started off well great graphics but as usual went down hill pay to play as standard games the lower level you are the more top tiers destroy your troops and village costing in millions of resources which you can't get because the output from fields is pathetic whilst to repair costs are in the millions. It started off with potential but I would steer clear of this game same as others just nicer graphics its so unbalanced unless you spend hundreds you don't stand a chance .,1
Really good game a base builder with quests and so on not a pay to play neither!!! Its got a PC style to it that reminds me of playing games on my pc as a kid lol!!! Great game and storyline too!!! Keep up the good work guys thanx!!!!,5
"Why is the troops so expensive to heal? What the hell... I spent some money on the game to progress faster and easier, but then some individual attacked my army during gathering and literally it costs MILIONS to heal 100k units... And I was gathering because of struggle to accumulate 1 million for building.. Now I need 4 millions for units I just had 10 minutes ago.. This NEEDS BALANCE! Unit heal is TOO EXPENSIVE!",2
"- Graphics: Incredibly beautiful and detailed. If you phone can handle high graphics it's a treat to eyes - Frame rate: It's smooth and not laggy. Again, if you have a high end device you can increase fps in game settings - Gameplay: You don't get bored at all. You finish something there's something else ready. So many things, errands, exploration, wars, management of city, villages, upgrading heroes... It's endless. So there's no space for boredom unlike other strategy games.",5
Way too long to train and upgrade! A whole day for level 9 chiefs hall is ridiculous. And 5 hrs training too! I was Loving it! But no thank you.,1
"One of the best games I've ever played (I'm a full time gamer) got the best concept, and there's always something for you to do. Best community over any communities. You'll never get bored of the game. I'd suggest the developers to reduce the training time and increase the marching time too. Also let us have the T3 and higher tier troops easily 😭 it's so tough. Overall it's the best game out there and the reason for me to give four star is I said it already. *warning* ""extremely addictive""",4
This is the best royal tribe game I've ever played in my life. This is teaching something unique and different information that you can rise something Tommorow and it's really fantastic 😍,5
"The game resembles an ant game I played before, with the exception that I have found some of the buttons on this game with the caption ""This feature is slated for a future update"". I like the single player aspect before getting into the multiplayer version of the game, and the multiplayer section isn't as cutthroat as some war games which works for a casual player like me. This has potential, so I'm giving it a shot.",3
"Nice story and gameplay. Fun and interesting to play. Not like other games, it's different everyone try once.",5
"Very good game but we need update on this tpic,,, my many heros talent was maxxed,,, but i have 100 more shard,,, what i can do with him,, hes just garbage for every one,,, you have to solution",5
"Definitely a microtransaction trap. Game difficulty shoots up like a straight cliff by the time you hit lvl 10. Summoned hero upgrade smoothly only up to 6 (6 out of 60) after that it takes anywhere from days to months for just one level.skill upgrade is impossible. The only option you have is ""pay to upgrade"". If that is not bad enough to grate at your sanity, if you ever get attacked by another player, the admin will actively give you false coordinates of ur attackers. stressful trash!",1
Don't invest your time into this. The single player is very limited and in clan wars it is a winner-takes-all style.,1
"Suprisingly, this is a really fun game! I'm new to this type of strategy game - not new to them completely, but new to it in actually sitting down snd giving it a try and figuring out how to play. Once I started to get the hang of what to do, I started to really enjoy it. The only thing I'd change is the level of violence and a more graphic depiction of it. That would likely change the tone of the game, but a darker, more violent tone and gameplay - with gore and blood - would be it really.",4
"I've read many reviews stating that it's not p2w game, so i tried only to get disappointed. Build and battle games are more like, money spending competition game. Buying things in game is like buying cheats. While it doesn't matter in player vs bots game. In real time pvp(player vs player) games it ruins any chance of fairness. This game is also no difference. It's gameplay is almost similar to rise of Kingdom. So, i wouldn't recommend this for anyone, unless you wanna waste your excessive money",1
"Beautiful graphics, story and gameplay. Worth 5 stars in theory, but the game hasn't even started and our tribe has been bullied by some 12 millions Might out of nowhere 🤮. Either one of the developers or someone spending thousands of dollars in the game. It completely ruined the experience and I cancelled the subscription and payments. I still play for free on my own because, again, the game itself is amazingly good 👍",2
"I like this game, because when I'm playing it is like I'm watching vikings. But I want to see more characters include floki, Bjorn,lagather,etc",2
I love the wild nature. it's like I am back in the times when Kings and Kings were fighting to conquer areas. Love it,5
"This is a great game, but if you want to play with your friends try another game! They put you into servers when you get leveled up and you CANNOT change servers at this time because they never thought that people would want to suggest the game to their friend IRL. Looking for a solution so I can play with my friends instead of the weird people from other countries.",1
A lot of fun and strategy in this game. Just started playing today so hopefully it continues to woo me. I'll add more layer.,4
"First, I was put in a server where everyone seem to have a big jump start and I've spent like over 200$ and there was made a king and they was all about letting you grow and they just kept plundering me(l ( the # 1 tribe) and I had no chance. I think I should get some kind of reimbursement or something. This is straight robbery and not cool. I think I'm going to report to better business bureau if don't see some kind of compensation.",5
"Hello. The Viking game is unique in terms of graphics and game hardware. But this game, as a strategic and long game, should not rely so much on in-app purchases, this is the only drawback of the game.",5
Nice graphics but boring and slow progress. hard to understand and hard to get gold/ rare heros.,2
"Love the game, been playing since server 48, have multiple accounts in multiple kingdoms/servers and made some great family along the way. Kvk is a blast to.",5
This game has rules that are just lame. If you want to join a alli if they don't have a fort u have to wait like half a week for it to be built. Or u can't teleport over lol. They should change the name to DMV rise cause you will be waiting for ever to enjoy a alli based game to play graphics are garbage and chews up a ton of memory. Game play is ok at best don't waste your time there's a lot better strategy games on here.,1
"It's very complicated. And you also feel very disconnected from your team and the game. The graphics are great. Lot of potential, but for me? Even after a Week I get the impression I'm missing something. And gameplay has become dull. Just sitting around waiting. Collect resources, click on anything with a red dot on it, etc.",3
It is a nice game but it takes to long for loading and some times it does not load in. 4 out of 5,4
"Played this game for 3 months now and still haven't gotten tired of it. You can play and advance really well without having to pay for it, which is super appreciated.",5
"Down from 5 to 1. I played this game constantly for a year, and it has gone from being a good, fun game where you had to work for your upgrades, but could always achieve them, to being so P2W that it's not funny. Even if you join a fresh server, within a day, there will be tribes that are already breaking 100 mil might. The game is no fun anymore.",1
"What makes this game stand out from all of the rest would be it's amazing game development. You can continuously adventure and have fun and not have to wait for the army to walk across the screen like in other games. Plus , not that you will have any problems because the game Play is smooth, their customer service is exemplary. Thank you for ur patience w/ my issue unrelated to ur game & for looking into ( double sign in). I started getting my experience points to level up my players xox 💋",5
Overall its a good game with a lot of things to change . 1- let us change our kingdom 2- make it more balance so some body with 20 milion might cant attack a 2 million might person 3- even at the begining tou cant join all tribes only few selected one 4- 2 or 3 tribe in every kingdome has all the power and all the good members even you are with them or you should delete app And lot of balance problems that i personaly said to team in instagram DM and Comments and still no change Thanks,4
"It's ok ...too many delays getting stuff done ...without spending money, that is. It would have been better to buy the game and not have any restrictions during gameplay.",3
"IGG You really need to sort out the in game Energy levels after 10min of game play it goes far to Quickly,Energy buffs are few & far between unless you pay for them!! Me like many others are not paying anymore money like other games when it's all about the Money you tend to kill the game.can you sort this out please. If this gets sorted Ppl will carry on playing if not it will die a death.",2
"I was listening to Peyton Parrish who did a cover for this game and all I can say is an hour of fun flew by!! Assassins creed Valhalla is an amazing game and this feels like that but crafting and building for a family. This game is great, and I'm pleased they put Eivor in. Great job on this game!! Can't wait to see what you add in the future!!!",4
"Just started play, and my tablet is slow. Great graphics, especially Dire Wolf and other monsters. Will rate it again after a week of game play.",4
"It's good strategy game but with the one thing I really disappointed that is research takes too much time and that's making game boring, I want to advise you think about it and reduce time of it, it will be good for Players and fun will remain the same.",2
The idea of needing like 40 players online and have them fight all at the same time following a strategy to do anything worth wile is nice..untill you do it. Immagine trying to to a 40 man raid in WoW Classic...back in classic. Have fun spending an hour waiting for everyone to show up then you realize 20 are undergeared 10 are afk and the rest went to the wrong raid...,2
"Exceeding poor customer service. Failed the test of deleting an account on request, been a month and still not deleted. It doesn't fill me with confidence if I had a game issue, particularly with money involved.",1
"Interface is a bit clunky, but that may be because I'm just learning the game and how to navigate. There seems to be too many choices at the begining of the game, it's difficult to know where to apply your resources efficiently ... but again, I'm just learning.",4
"I've only played for a few days, but it's obvious that a lot of thought and a lot of user feedback has gone into the creation of this masterpiece. Be warned: it's irresistable, and you're going to spend a lot of time at work or school totally exhausted, but smiling while you mull what to do next in the game. ;)",5
"If you are a strategy game lover you are 100% going to enjoy it. The graphic, character and everything is awesome. I will give 5stars when there's an option to visit your Alliance or scout to check their camp/village i know that would be possible so i am hoping to see that soon.",4
"The usual build a empire game with better graphics, early game play rewarded amply, and a clear progression of challenges . Would like a guidance for recommended game progression",4
"The game is actually decent but the same group dominates every kingdom with unknowledgable and egotistical leaders that spend enough money to threaten and harass any players they don't want. Honestly, save yourself the hassle, time and especially any $ you have to spend on gaming and find a much better player base. This is the worst one I have ever had the displeasure to play with. 5 kingdoms in 6 weeks and literally the same idiots dictating every one of them. Just not a fun game environment",1
"Thoroughly enjoy this game. I had expected not to like it but it reminds me very much of civilization, but soooo much better. There doesn't feel like any stop, I can continually grow in the game without paying",5
"Really enjoyed the game. Stuck on chapter 26, as it requires joining a tribe in order to complete the required task. Don't have to the time to join a tribe as I only log on periodically to complete things and most tribes seem like they boot people that aren't 100% dedicated to this game.",1
WHY am I unable to listen to music on another app while playing??? Every other game allows it. But this one shuts the music off each time it loads. REALLY annoying...,2
For a few nights know multiple players is expierencing alot of lagging and is unable to play at night. From 19:00 UTC till early mornings. Very annoying. Other than that the game is nice,2
"This is amazing i love it, the graphics are really awesome and its easy to play, no bugs and smooth game play no ads and etc, i wish this game will never ends. ★★★★★",5
"Good adventure game. Especially the locations are Likes more,,,, need to improve more story characters, love, friendships, enemies,,,,",4
"The ads for this game are totally fake. The game is not much awesome, cool and fun like the ads, moreover it is repetative and boring. Wasted my data",3
I used to play lost empires. But that games devlopers didn't much cared about and the games server died. Been searching for something like that for a long time. My search finally ended here.,5
Need to maybe shorten up the waiting period on researching and upgrading. Waiting forever makes it harder to want to continue to play.,3
"This is the closest game to AOE I've played on mobile, not accurate to the ads, and not as serious of a game, however fairly playable without spending real money.",4
"Great game, it's challenging and has plenty speed ups for upgrading that makes it a lot more fun playing rather than having to wait forever, two thumbs up",5
"Enjoying the game, then another player 3 times more powerful repeatedly attacked until I had no force, effectively locking me out of the game for 12 hours. Sorry I spent money with you guys.",2
"There is a lot to do in this game, and while it may be overwhelming at first, you'll grow to appreciate the variety of activities and quests. It's possible to play this game for free and to advance at a steady rate, but I recommend finding an established clan to help protect you from the P2W whales who will prey on you. (If you do choose to make in-game purchases, you get your money's worth.) The devs are very active, so if you run into a bug, join the official discord, and they'll help!",4
The network issues are unbearable and growth after sometime just becomes stagnant not to mention one to many events that one never wins coz there I p2p players that are too powerful.,1
"Could be a really fun game, but typical greedy game makers, make it impossible to compete, unless you pay dearly, no matter how much time you spend on the game building",2
There are so many advertisement on the main top screen which is very bad. There are so many heroes whose shards are unable to get by f2p heroes. Valor doesn't give legendary heroes even after 1k tries.,2
"Ive already rated this game, Its a good city builder/management game. The same as all the rest, eventually it takes 48 hrs to upgrade buildings. You all know what im talkin about. Only ratin again for the 2 gems.",5
"The game is perfect just need no fix some lag problems. 4 starts for now, i just can't wait for the update so the players can use mount.",4
"It's my first time playing a game like this one, & so far, it has been really fun. I don't know much about world building, but the in-game characters are very much helpful & I'm finding my feet quite nicely",4
Horrible game!! You run out of resources almost immediately and it's impossible to continue without spending real money for resources! Uninstalled after 2 days of playing.,1
"This is a very good game!The graphics,compared to its game size is very good!The battle styles,the heroes and the enemy designs are very good!",5
"Good storyline so far, only played an hour. The time flew. Waiting to see what happens next.",3
"Hello, have a good time... Thank you for your efforts... I had a request from you to add the Persian language to the game... Thank you very much.",5
"About over 90 phone crashes every week for the month!?! Not sure what you have done with the last updates??? 120 days in. Thinking about quitting, play is impossible",1
"Well paced and doesn't comstantly beg for money via ingame purchases. Nice change to see the usual flaws avoided. Sucks the phone battery dry, though.",4
P2P over over complicated back story and user face. Not sure how long they keep their player base but random kingdom I'm in full of Russian players who don't talk and don't want to engage in fair play,1
"They should add a building and research progress bar to the screen. It's happened a few times that I didn't realize I wasn't busy building or researching something. Also the resource gaining is weird. There's no resource buildings and you have to gather constantly, even then it's not enough to train, build and research all the time. Eventually you're going to have to spend money buying resources, which is a waste of money.",2
So far I like it. Easy to play and the tutorials are helpful to understand the game play. Won't take too l9ng to get the hang of it.,4
its got a lot of house and the land is too vast that you forget you own it. i've enjoyed enough of it. its a good game nonetheless,5
"Unlike what it seems this game is not about war, fight, attacks and defences, or strategy and tactics. It's all about farming including some snake eating dots. Actually, it's a new version of SIM CITY farms. There is the least possible back and force between players and tribes, there is no actual compete and war between them. Everybody is farming and attacking nocs. It's so wierd that defeating troops, bases or buildings has no exp and it's only neverending in game challenges to get points",2
I'm enjoying the quick pace of the game and the minimal window pop ups to claim rewards. These types of games usually create hours in total spent waiting for window loading and pointless clicking for rewards in other areas away from actual game play. So extra star for developing the game around more focus on traversing map and more immersive interaction on map,4
The game in itself is really good all the features and how the game works I really like it but there are some things that can be improved but this things are a little huge like when I am marching towards enemy the graphic can be more realistic and in 3D like in more better quality and when they are moving on the ground so it should look more realistic and when fighting also the game developers can improve these things thanks 👍,5
"Brilliant graphics, wasted on a slow klunky endless locked interdependent loops game. Far too frustrating for beginners even those experienced in other games. Need ress, need to kill monster, need more troops can't because need more ress to make troops etc etc etc etc. Don't waste your time. Or money. If only it moved like the advert.",1
"I'll have to agree with other critics that the game has an incredible lag. I can't decipher if it is a memory leak, which is what I'm leaning towards, or simply a really bad ping between servers and user. I can say that it is taking up an incredible of both memory and bandwidth. Without those two problems, I would've given the game 5 stars. The game is engaging and great in tutorial. I hope further development happens to refine the issues presented.",3
Really disappointed. Spent over an hour playing before I realized participation with other players mandatory! What a waste of my time! Thought I'd give a review before uninstalling. The advert didn't show any hint of teams. I'd rather slam my hand in a car door daily than play with other people. Really wish they had been upfront about it.,1
"In game name ""Canada"" server 4. It's a new game destined for hours of fun for anyone who likes rts games. The mechanics are simple enough to enjoy but there are tools you can use to your advantage. The only thing to watch out for.. is when you attack a player, you cannot protect yourself for 17 mins or so, ultimately making the end game a pay to win. Be careful who you make foes with & have fun!",5
"Overall, The Game is so good, And It is quite fun, However I keep finding a problem: 1. The Game lags and I can't see anyone other than me, 2. When I try to log on, It is says: Unable To log in due to Network problems or other problems. 3. When I usually move, There is that spinning circle that I have to wait for to stop. But Overall, Viking Rise is The Best.",5
"A game I enjoy playing, majorily, because I can interact with others. There's lots of micro transactions, that will tempt you a lot, if you want to buy the packs, I won't Stop you, but at least take a moment to learn a bit or ask other players whether the pack is worth it. The game is fun overall with all the multiplayer activities you can have. There are Pay to Win elements but it will become imminent only in the late game stages, as a result, no 5 stars. Some might argue the 4 star also.",4
"This game is really,truly amazing where you can be a team and work together and also interact with other players.HAVE FUN. This game teaches you about planning about how you can use your resources to upgrade your city and have better might. Finding tribes that can help you get stronger, taking down beas and claiming rewards is the BEST. But developers I have a SUGGESTION can you add a delete button for accounts that we dont' want anymore or a feature that can delete an existing account :)...",4
I hate rating because you always get asked too soon. So far it's very good no issues as I play more ill try to update this Update. Love the story mode and gathering of materials. Dislike the attacking of other players. It messed with my anxiety only have one piece shield and was attacked shortly after it expired. If you like these games you will love this. Sadly I have had to many bad experiences with games like this so I have left.,4
"Lots of buttons to click in the first week's gameplay loop to get you hooked. Progress slows down as levels progress unless you want to dump piles of cash on speed-ups and boosts, which doesn't really matter because like most other igg games there will be a Chinese guild with literally 4x the power of the next closest guild bullying the entire server and acting like it takes skill to enter a credit card number. Don't waste your time, or your money.",1
"The game is really good and engaging. The graphics are amazing , all seems fine. The only thing that I would like to say is the attacking strategies which is very simple! I would have loved it more if we could attack the enemies in a an actually strategic way. Currently your winning chance is 100 percent dependent on the number of troops that you have , not the way you attack the enemy!",4
"The reason I didn't give the game 5 stars is because, there are still too many bugs in the game. The game has potential to go far, but these minor issues should be addressed by developers first. One of the things I'm experiencing in the game is all my buildings continue to glow in a very bright yellow color. This make it hard to determine what building is what.",4
"This game is the best game where you build a civilization out there. Graphics are incredible, performance is very smooth, and realistic colours make the game far more immersive. I like it! And the best features are the support they offer and the fact that anyone can play it! Free!. The game is also the same if you are a f2p or pay2win. Something I like is it can teach you how to save on resources when you are a f2p in both the game and real life when you are in need on resources/shelter. LOVE IT",5
"Honestly Angry Came back to the game after just reaching level 8 to find a high level player with over 3,000,000 might had just consistently fed off my resources. The single player attacked me 28 times, in a 6 minute time span. After killing my whole army it was easy for him, after the 4th loss the proceeding 24 attacks were so easy for him they were seconds apart. Reached out to support thinking this couldn't possibly be how the game works, was indeed told this was how the game works🤷🏼‍♂️",1
"Promotional ads and showcase photos on this app does not reflect actual gameplay. However, graphics are somewhat accurate. Gameplay mostly consists of waiting, gathering resources via waiting, fighting which damages troops leading to injured troops that require waiting for healing. This is not a good game if you want to play it all day. However, if you want to spend your free 5-10 minutes, you can do so with this game.",3
"This game is very good and addictive too, but here a big player kills and loots a small player easily and there are no resources so that small players can recover again, some people pass the time in the game map. Like gathering resources, doing activities etc. But the big players have made it difficult to enjoy the game, now I don't want to waste my time in this game. Also, there is always an error of network.",1
"Fun game. The map is a bit confusing at first. Some other minor issues like there aren't icons for some side missions on the screen, they appear over the building instead and it tends to drain my battery when I'm not playing during the day. Otherwise Im having a decent time",4
"Quite fun up till one finishes the single player campaign, after which it turns into your average pay to win mobile game. Has some good ideas, and it's visually pleasing, but in its current state it is but a waste of time unfortunately.",2
"By far the best, cleanest UI and most polished build and battle game available. I've played a few and this one is really growing on me. Wonderful atmosphere, good graphics, awesome heroes and it keeps you engaged in the grind. 10/10. Only thing I hate is the ads in the right top corner for purchases that these games always have. Why not just a shop button?? It really distorts the gaming screen.",5
"Its a decent game, I enjoy the building and all the tasks alot i mean its a decent game. But the reason it gets 3 stars is because 1 its super like laggy you would say it keeps popping up with a loading screen when my wifi is perfectly fine. it may be because my computer but it might not be i cant tell you because i dont know.",3
"Congrats on Development as you now understand I was never wrong about the aspects of security. Cannot Believe though you still insist on hiding data on this device. Crazy how the twisted players data is handed in Bot formula. Players understand we have a different map to that of the underworld. Still carry on with the excellent work. PS thanks for allowing me to write my own script 🤣 Corrupt data pool, Request Developer Delete and install updated version. No in game delete option available 😂",2
"Initial install ok, guided tasks served as tutorial, occasional graphics corruption on my Android tablet until I reduced graphics setting to ""low detail"". Game hung when trying to summon hero, frozen until force-quit. Restarting game results in fail/retry loop when loading settings. Uninstall and reinstall, clear cache and data, nothing changed. Abandoned effort - maybe your experience will be different.",1
"This game has been addicting from the start, I absolutely love it and there is no need for microtransactions unlike most games unless you really want to support the game and developers. I made a purchase because I enjoy it so much and it's a nice change of pace unlike other games that force you to make the microtransactions. The graphics are beautiful, storyline is great, voice acting is pretty awesome, I have no complaints whatsoever.",5
"This game is 100% money grab. I did make numerous purchases to increase my might. I was attacked, for no reason, 10+ times by numerous accounts that I have to spend weeks repairing or spend even more $ just to get back to where my PAID $ got me to. Support was absolutely no help. There is a ""kill event"" in which that is the intent but not during normal times. Get attacked on way to gathering or during a quick nufling skirmish. Want to lose your money for nothing, play this game. Horrible.",1
"So far, so good :) - I'm updating my review: from 4 stars to 1: This game looks great, and that's it, lol. It's a pay to win game, and that really sucks. I spent $100 dollar on it, and i didn't improve at all. They just want your money. At this moment, im just farming resources, unable to improve anything until i finish farming for like a month or much more. Who knows. They just want you to buy resources and it will never end because you need lots of it to improve. Stay away! Lol!",1
"It has been a rather good game so far. The playthrough is nice. As with all games it does take a number of hours or days to upgrade your buildings but that is something we see in a lot of games especially famous ones on Android. It takes a a while to build yourself up, I suppose it part of the story and you start from scratch. It's been a good game so far but more work could be done to make it better and improve the overall experience and playthrough.",3
"1- again i want say you must solve it the need for be Smoother and more stable, and also to improve the frames (FPS) 2- And also make the game more fair between those who do not pay and those who pay and add the advantage of prizes through ads 3- Add the automatic translation feature, because it is really difficult when pressing the translation button at each message",1
"The game is created wonderfully. Graphics music extra. The issues of this game is in first stage everything is free so it looks easy to you,when it gets next level everything will slower and it get paid to complete the game.",5
"It would be better if the tutorial wouldn't force you to waste a 5 min speedup on a 1 min wait. There aren't very many to begin with, so it's something that passed me off right at the beginning. There are also very few resources to gather; so most of the time you have a bunch of workers wandering around doing nothing.",3
"It's a grind,but fun builder,what can I say?They use a viking theme but it's no different than zombies,or vampires,or WW2 themed,the design is to get a base and heroes levelled up, story only so far,till you get to tne player versus player portion.Then it's wallets versus free players who then get farmed by the spenders , who wait sometimes a week to get research,or village huts levelled just to 15,because as usual,shields cost big",1
"Overall it is a good game. This patch I think there is a bug on the notification. I don't receive notification that my gathering troops have returned unlike before the update, FYI I didn't change anything on the notification settings in-game. Please fix the bug thank you.",3
"This game is good but also sucks.. in this game ive experience some technicall issues like crassing, lagging and un-able to log in even with good internet connection.. ive rated it 2 ⭐ because i like the plot,wars,troops, and the clan help... But little problem is that everytime you rally an enemy even if you had a 4x the ammount of warriors to rally the enemy you would lose easilly...... So pkease fix this app properly☺️☺️☺️",2
"Theme, art, story are all really good so far. The gameplay is a bit formulaic and is like many other games out there but I like that it hasn't (so far) asked me to join a guild or do pvp battles. It is a bit system heavy and drains my phones battery pretty quickly.",4
"Amazing Graphics and story mode You can explore new areas(Villages) Got lots of new option like killing mosters, securing tower for new Village and more (It's like new genre of 2.5D multiplayer own creation game)",4
"By far ___ [not going to say the best because something can ALWAYS be better] one of the better 'mobile based' games in it's category. I will say it's the 'best' that IGG has developed standing up to it's description, trailers and in-game video {certainly blow's away their disaster ""Lord's Mobile""} However like ALL GAME'S it's only as good as what (effort and yes {a little}p$p is involved)you put into it, that and MAKING ABSOLUTELY SURE you get into a good tribe; for it makes ALL the difference",5
"Not perfect, but not bad either, it's a good game, keeps one sorely focused on objective if you ask me",4
It took a little bit to understand it but it's definitely fun the more you play in the more you learn definitely a lot of aspects to the game give you plenty occupied,5
"The graphics in this game are amazing and the gameplay is good too. The reason for the 2 star rating is the game is so slow and keeps crashing. I'm thinking of uninstalling it. I've now changed my review to 5 star as it's working fine now, with no problem's at all.",5
It's pretty cool so far. I'm not much of a buld your city kind of game person but I'm having decent fun with it. Easy to play on down time,5
Game is visualy great. Game mechanics is interesting. Story is well written. On the other hand any game that allows one player with 2.000.000 might to attack beginner with 49.000 might and keep attacking for 8 additional times is a big pile of dog turd. It simply isn't worth the effort.,2
It's a great game and the subtle hints to use real cash are not has bad has other games in this genre just remember with these games it is a business for the makers who intend on taking what they can get,4
It's your standard build to survive and fight. Great graphics and of course the more money you spend the better you will be,4
Hello i can't play with my pc. Something went wrong....I tried to install in two different directory. But nothing changes,3
"Not impressed. To much tutorial to start, then not enough. Not very intuitive.",1
"its a reallly good game, decent graphics. only thing confused me is why does this ivor looks pretty much identical to ivor from assassins creed valhalla",4
Bad servers. and services. game crashes all the time specialy when there is a event,1
"This game is fun and addictive to a point, I would give it 5 stars but I've been playing this game for 3 days on a brand-new server, and there's some sketchy stuff going on. Within the first 24hr of the sever an entire clan of Koreans were in the millions with individual power. 90% of the server at that time was just breaking into the low hundred thousand range. I can't say for sure but it looks like there's. A boatload of hacking in this game. SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY !!!!",1
After watching the series vikings on Netflix i must say that ive grown to really like and enjoy this game quite a bit i would definitely recommend downloading and watching the tv series as well if you have not lol,4
very fun I like how the game just gets more interesting and it's real great my only fault is it's just like every other game and you have to build stuff but takes 1000 years just to finish,4
I have high speed wifi and full internet in my jio after all this. I am having Always network issue with this game. Game nice but very poor maintenance.,1
"The amount of 5 star reviews is definitely inflated. You get a reward for giving 5 stars very early on so its not representing how people really feel about it. I'm changing my review to 1 star because the game isn't good. It's boring, not sure where the strategy aspect of the game comes in since you don't have control over your troops in combat. I went to sleep, woke up to 120 messages in my inbox saying I had been defeated 120 times by one other player who had significantly higher might.Lol?",1
Unless you have super eyesight good luck reading the dialog. Game is good otherwise please up the font of the game thank you,3
"The games is good , the longer it takes .. it's getting more fun to build your kingdom",5
"Nice graphics however it is the typical pay-to-build-faster-to-win game. After a few stages of the tutorial, attention is drawn away from the 'dark forces' and more towards other players, leaving one to wonder why focus on monsters in the story.",3
The idea of collecting resources is really good and I feel like this strategy game is in front of its time and at the same time I like the combat styles and how you unlock new characters in general so I really like the game one little issue though is that the game kind of does lag but has its ups.,5
"Great game. It gets 4 stars for now. I've been playing it for a week and love everything about it so far. Graphics and gamplay are epic, although it requires a lot of resources, so in saying that, I hope this won't end up being a pay to play as you level up as per usual. Will rate again after a few months. Thanks",4
Very fun. A few bugs than can be frustrating at times but nice rewards when the developers fix them. Great graphics. Takes up too much memory though. Easy to lose the day on this one.,4
"Overall just another copy of war games with long build time and scarce resources. Level 12 buildings will likely take you days to complete, and resources you will need to hoard resources for days in order to build them. Gameplay is also not great, mostly you sit and wait, or you get bully clans who just like to spoil the game for others. So unless you have tons of money, or tons of time to waste, on a game which is full of bullies, just stay away...",2
My experience is good.. but you should include a feature to change a kingdom too ... As sometimes tribe stronger in Kingdom make use of their powers in a harrasment manner.... They keep on attacking a same person in case of personal heat up in chat .. so that person has no choice left .. he will delete the game for forever or start game from level1.. .. if this thing Happens with level 22 -25 bases ... Person feel broken and left the game...,5
Another pay to pause game. A game that requires shields to pause is not a healthy game. My money goes to better games.,1
"Game is fun for the first few hours, but as you progress further you'll find it to be rather slow and tedious. But that's typical for pay to win games like this one where a large number of the player base has access to mommy's credit card. But, other than that it can be quite fun early game. Late game, as I said, gets tedious. I have a strong hatred for P2W games which is why I'll leave a 1 star review. No game should reward their players for their bank accounts. The game also lags a lot!",1
I liked the game but after some time things just starts repeating itshelf and to me this game felt like loop of repeatition of doing same thing again and again.,4
"Love this game. Storyline is engaging, game play easy to follow and like that we can have two chief profiles per Kingdom.",5
It's really good it's keeping me intrigued alot more than other games. but 5 mins in I would have quit already where as in this game 3 hours later I'm still playing it and enjoying it,5
Great strategy game. Good story lines. Love the game and YOU WILL TOO!!!,5
"I found this game so far too be addicting but, it does take too long to up grade buildings at my level of only 15 and to long to re-energize once you've run out there's no place to buy a potion. The lag is bad I have to close out the game and load it back up.. but I love the tribe feature and the events almost like everquest.",5
A good way to spend time i love graphics and the concept of this unlike other dtrategy games where its pay to win and hard in leveling waitkng for more days unless you accept their offer of purchasing additional items to make u stronger,5
"Very detailed, great animation and audio. Free so far and im 9 levels into it.",5
"Thought this was a very cool game to start and I am still hopeful, however something has occurred that concerns me. I built a tribe ""alliance"" rather than joining an existing one so I could make it available to my irl friends playing with me. A random player joined which I'm fine with, but I log in this morning to find that the game says I've transferred leadership to him which I didn't. If it's a glitch that's fine, I understand bugs. But rando/automatic transfer of leadership is not cool.",2
This game provides a very good amount of germs and the times for upgrade the buildings are also limited. I am very impressed with the game but it will be more better to lower the rate of the upgrades. Rather than that every thing is excellent and amazing.👍👍👍,5
"Without a doubt the best mmorpg game out there. The progress in the game takes place really quickly and one doesn't need to spend real money to compete with other players, wise usage of free rewards and a little patience is all that the game requires and you can compete with anyone. Really can't thank the developers enough for the effort they put into the game.",5
"Really enjoying the game. Excellent story line, great strategy for increasing strength, units etc.",5
"Awesome graphics, it's just that sometimes it gets laggy. I have to agree with other reviews that it's not a PTW game. Would've given it 5 ⭐ if it will become an engaging battle instead of it being dependent upon your Hero might and number of battle troops.",4
"This game is pay to win. Active free play alliance 2 months into a server and can't beat NPCs. Drop rates of useful items is virtually non existent. Event rewards are terrible and not worth the investment it takes to finish them. Overall I recommend never installing this game unless you have $50,000 to invest on day 1. They made things harder for spenders but don't care others can't even begin to compete.",1
"would not play if i were you, game screens are not what they are, leidolf is not a legendary, the boat with the reticle is not how it's played. it's fun for a while but the game is not nearly finished. a month and it's boring +there is no migration option, so server dead = game dead .. would ask for a refund of money, but not possible (even though it can be perceived as false advertising)",2
The gaming experience is great. Visuals are on point. I love how they keep a balance between paying and free users. I hope this game does not become a pay to win. Keep it at a balance and try to limit purchases so cheaters or money spenders don't get ahead too much. I've only seen chinese big spenders or hackers so far. Keep up the good work!,5
"Really enjoy the game some things can be a little hard if not used to the game but overall really good game, im more of an offline person myself, id like to say that the game would be better if you could choose your weapons and gear and mounts to use at your choice and id really like to see more famour vikings to be able to use and beserkers would be sick also or to be able to use shield wall type moves in battles thanks for the enjoyment keep up the great work",5
"I would enjoy the game so much more if it wasn't based so heavily around joining the right tribe. It would be really nice if tribal things were a nice optional extra, but it seems you really can't progress in the game without. Griefing also seems to have very little recourse. May die like ""Rust"" did if you're relying on a community being good in a game like this.",3
Nice game. But it takes a much long time to get stronger for free to play players compare to pay to play players. At the en 'money' mstters.,3
"The visuals for the game is great, sending out workers to gather resources changes the game up a bit so you dont need to waste tokens. At times the game maybe slow but I find it worth it.",4
"I have been playing this game for over a month, and it has been mostly ok, but as with all these types of games it becomes very repetitive and they of course allow you to be bullied by players with higher power making progress slow and frustrating. Hopefully, one day, a developer will have the decency to stop this unfair game play, but they won't because you need resources to rebuild, which usually means money being spent",2
"Was introduced to this game by my friends, I didn't think it was cool until I started playing it. Damn everything about this game is cool but I still feel like there's something missing in the game that's why I gave 4 stars",4
"Kinda fun, except for really being able to do anything it's a pay for play. Often preyed upon by those that spend alot",3
Nice game. It's amazing to not have ads. Pretty simple and straight forward game for civilization game lovers.,5
"So, a bunch of us left a dying Space game for this, We're only low lvl but so far, it's like Age of Empires meets Clash of Clans...Mobile edition(yeah yeah CoC is mobile but AoE and it's many sequels are not silly!), Anyway, we're having a blast so far, that other game is dead now since we've been having fun on this one. It does have Vega Conflict style ""Rush-to-conplete"", but what mobile game doesn't?? All in all its great so far. If I/we were farther in the game I'd feel justified in a 5 star.",4
"This game is amazing! It has no glitches it is wonderful game it has alot of adventures it has wonderful designs I haven't stopped playing it this game even keeps me up at night I do not think I am going to sleep again because of this great game.(it is from the series ""VIKINGS"")",5
"I would really love to play this game the idea is great But, I can't tolerate games that make you start again from scratch because you've been invaded and destroyed every time you go back into the game. If I have to constantly play a game so I can keep my progress, then that game is not for me. This game reminds me of ground hog day with my previous efforts being all for nothing. I can't comment on anything else with the game because I haven't been able to get any further then the first fight.",2
"Seems like it's going to be like RoK, CoD, etc. though this is first I know of to do a different thing with the map and first I know of to be based on a show or movie. Can't really rate it, for some reason the fad is to have players rate a game after 5-20 minutes of game play, before they even have the full game available for them work with to decide on such things. Edit: Unlocked alliances and scouting, etc. Yes, it's like those games, including the pay to win aspect and toxic community.",1
Very unfriendly environment and people. It's very hard to get in top active guilds. Server that open today and already mean cash people in active top guilds. It's unpleasant to try to enjoy and discover this game. Definitely not for beginners. It have too many things to do and very slow to power up also Drop Hero rate is trash.,1
Graphics are cool and the instructions are perfectly fine for the new ones playing the game. Awesome,5
"""You won't do great unless you pay, but still fun if you don't mind grinding"" Previous 5* review as I was enjoying it to begin with. Dropping to 1*. Grind all you want, you won't do well at all unless you pay hundreds or thousands of ££$$. Game is geared for the spenders. Terrible lagging, especially when switching accounts, Thrown out the app several times a day. Also for a war game there is no war. Top tribes band together to take all the pve capture points. PAY LOTS AND BUILD. That's it.",1
"Typical war game spenders kill off all others, resources almost none very long builds, events only for top 4 alliances and let's not even talk about sheilds and teleports they are a joke",1
Doesn't relocate city in tribe area. Alway say clear surrounding area but no way to clean it. Frustrated as not able to play game properly due to this🥵,1
"Bit of lag and kind of annoying that you need to be a sertan level to clear woods. Trees don't grow, limiting even more the scarse resources you have.",3
It's fun for a while but essentially the same as so many other games that you eventually have to pay to get anywhere in.,3
I just started playing this game I like game's whare I can build up my own village. I don't like when the game all the maclly what's me to jump in to alliance. Rushing a player in a alliance . Is not how I like to play it takes time. No rush just play every day play events grinding is not a bad thing sometimes we do have the money to spend. When I hit a dead end I just update my barracks when there dune I get a notification I'll hope back on there's and there will be something to do.,4
"Good game, able to play and progress even without paying into it. Great graphics and a nice story to start with. Things get interesting as you progress and interact with other players in the kingdom. :)",5
"Most realistic and with good story line , Works perfectly until now , i downloaded this on 28/8/23, if anything felt laggy I will reply i shifted from Call of dragons.",5
"I love playing this game because I can meet new people and having fun teaming up with other players. But I am only giving 4 stars because I can't handle that the game keep on crashing. I have other online games on my phone but they are all running smoothly but when I am playing this game, I am having problems. Please fix this as soon as possible. Thank you.",4
"So far the game is good and actually very fun alittle slow at first, but that's ok when you got the time. The game it seems like it furnishes the stuff for you in order to progress building is very slow, but it's not a big deal it dose crash sometimes and surprisingly there's no In game store wich is great or maybe I haven't found it yet. With some tweaks and updates this will be a great mobile game so far its fun and addictive well see how it gose. I'll update my review if there are changes.",5
The constant log in errors due to technical issues on your side is terrible! And always happens in event. If this happens in kill event you should then compensate all players with resources enough to heal and retrain lost troops!,1
"All pre existing servers should be getting in mail compensation with first time occupation rewards for indestructible tower. Giving players only 12 hours to build to towers that just randomly appeared on map is a bunch of bs. And this requires compensation. I spent alot of money in this game, but I won't spend a dime until they make this right.",1
The game was fine and enjoyable until for some reason one day when I opened the app it started from the beginning. For reason my data was lost. I lost months worths of progress and I'm not doing that all over again.,1
"It's great,because I'm looking for a game that a real persons voice are used,and true season and weather.",5
"The game is great,and the details are amazing, and it's cool how the characters read it to you!",5
"It's fun, different from what I usually play. I'm don't normally play games like this, but it came up on Mistplay so I thought, 'Okay, I'll play long enough to get some units then uninstall it' ....yeah, right! I couldn't put it down! I played until 2 in the morning! I installed it at 9 pm! Loving the game needless to say. Lol",5
I am really enjoying Viking Rise. It's innovative and a great way to occupy your time.,5
"'Till now the game is enjoyable and is very great, but one tiny little problem..it does lag a bit, does the storage play a role on this lagging?",4
"Graphics are kinda cool, I got to level 5 in about an hour. But it will get harder as you progress.maybe an update later. No ads, which is cool and has no glinchs so far. But it does take a while to load in parts. Mixer",4
A good game. It's fun gathering resources training sholders and gaining new heros but can be upgraded to much more smoother version,4
"I only play this game for mistplay points. The game is bland and nothing new to the MMO genre. The aesthetic of vikings is cool for about 10 minutes in game then you realize it's the same game, different skin. The game gets old fast and too many young children having conversations with adults and exposed to toxic behavior. Not my cup of tea",1
Great experience was expecting to be let down but its actually a fun game could do with a better way of moving your city around though but thats a small pride to pay for a good game and the micro transactions are in the middle of the screen at least put them in one area in the store or something its a little annoying,4
Keeping it a four...just started a new after barely playing. Will give 5 stars when lags are optimized,4
Fun to start. Very helpful tutorial sequences. Has not asked for money yet! Could use a bit of magnification for light gray wording on white backgrounds - at least for these old eyes. Very engaging so far.,4
So far love it I haven't found any lag in the game at all as of yet and the visuals are great,5
"Honestly, this is a really nice game, I like how it stays fun, and nothing takes hours to complete",5
"The game couldn't be more confusing and it's stupid. The power of the leader doesn't mean a dam thing when attacking the only thing that matters is the amount of troops which is dumb and from there you can see how they want you to play this game. Waiting unnecessarily long amounts of time just getting troops or pay to get them faster and if you wanna advance the story, you know the reason people actually play games for, you gotta invest that capital if not don't bother. Smell that greed from em",1
"Enjoying the fluidity of the game from base building to troop movements without loading screens. Map exploration without loading screens, straight from base. Side quests along with the normal advancement goals.",5
"A very nice game, met some nice and not so nice people but a very fun experience so far, i do have a thought about adding a feature to the game though, how about adding roles? Like: raiders with boosted attack but debuffed gathering, scholars with boosted research skills but debuffed attack and shippers with boosted resource gathering and shipment of resources to allies but slower marching speed",5
"Game is fun but note that there is only a relocation option until your chief hall is lvl 8. any progress made will be lost as you have to create a new character to change kingdoms. This pertains to joining a specific tribe that a friend may be in. ALL money spent and progress made WILL be locked to the character it was made on, Purchases are NOT linked to your account but to the individual character that made them.",2
"Very interesting game and the storyline is great. What can I say it's the most lovely game. It's not addicting and the happiness you get from capturing or upgrading is priceless and fun. I never thought it would be this good,if you put the graphics to medium or high it's 🔥 The attention to the graphic is more than ever. I promise I would never get bored of this game in lifetime. I might be over-reacting but if you don't belive me just check out the game. I don't pay attention to my games -Yug",5
The graphics are stunning compared to other similar games and I really like the concept of conquer your own land within your base part the part I don't like is being forced to join a Corp and attack other people like every other MMO because then you don't get to enjoy the single player part because you are healing wounded and rebuilding your base you have a great single player part it should be kept as that and not attack other people for the petty amount of resources you could of had farming .,3
"So far, just a few hours in, good game. Fairly easy to follow, quite a lot to do. Haven't seen any obnoxious ads for $$$ yet, a pleasure. Sure there's a shop or something but so far so push to spend. Stay tuned, I'll upgrade in a couples of days.",5
"I like the game. There is a lots of things to do with great strategies you can increase your might. I don't know if IGG team will read this or not but I have one suggestion that you have to add on trade option between players where they can trade anything, gems, experience books, etc. It will help to grow the beginners. Thanks a alot for this amazing game.",5
"Would of been 5 stars... such a great game, ruined by the Chinese players who have unlimited wallets. The top tribe is over 500 million power more than the tribe in second place. There is absolutely no balance whatsoever. I've played for 2 weeks straight all for me just to delete it Purely pay to win, and if you don't pay hundreds of thousands, you can't even compete...",1
Slow start kinda. Would be nice to have to choose upgrade path more to make game aittle more diverse. But so far pretty enjoyable. I've only put a few hours in so it's hard to tell how this game diversefies later on..,4
This game will let you play for only a limited time without registering an account to purchase items. It logged me out saying my log in had expired and then erased all my progress over the last couple weeks and restarted the game. Don't waste your time!,1
Game doesn't load since 2 days. Graphics are great and good gameplay. If it's fixed more ⭐,3
Great game so far tutorials are fun and comprehensive. Lots of different things to learn.,4
This game is slow for some people who are used to doing things faster but it has good graphics and you need to grow,4
"One of the worst game so far in this category. All events are for p2p players only, 1 or 2 days to complete events not much rewards. It's just p2p. U can play for a week and upgrade till 14-15 level after that u hit a wall where u can't do anything. Nothing interesting also since the events don't last long and u need to be at above level 10 to play some events and the heros need to be 35 and above like that's easy to level up to 35.dont know why they boosting in reviews telling it's f2p.",1
"Awesome, great experience playing this game and would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in vikings.",5
P2w very hard to level up hero's and skills and horrible lagging and frame rate drop not smooth game full of lag and bugs,1
"Recently, I've been playing this game and enjoying it immensely. However, I have now decided to leave this game and no longer play as it is a waste of time there are a massive guild on here known as TOYS this guys are the lowest of the low they basically are exploting in game events by joining low level guilds or clans and then multiple times rinse and repeat mechanics doing it to exploit the gem farming system so there stealing not only from the developers but others who are progressing honest!",1
"It's honestly really good, and I really like it. However sometimes when I try to mine something it's unresponsive and takes a while before it can be mined or it tells me I need to clear the area other then that really good",4
"Challenges are what strategy games are all about.....and this game gives big time. Challenges is what it creates on a higher level,",5
"Honestly , Really great game, The Reason i give 1 star is that it's reallocation system , i dont have words to describe how bad it is , it's simply terrible. I download this game for the sole purpose to play with my friends. But i cant reallocate my city to another territory. If you're thinking about playing this game with friends, dont install it . Other than that it is really good game for single players.",1
"I was looking for a simulator to capture what I love about them. A good story, tons of upgrades, strategy, and your own base that you can customize. This game is awesome",5
"Man I gave this 5 stars at first and I still would had the game not been so greedy and actually care about the players. This game shouldn't be rank 44 in Google play. It should of stayed in the top 3 but as long as ONE PLAYER can hold all the gates and CONTROL the whole kingdom, this game will keep failing and dropping in ranks. Please fix it devs and listen to your players.",1
It's not a bad game it's actually quite fun until you run into someone who dropped about $500 like most of these kinda games. They need free players for the whales to beat on. There is an event that fires about 10 days on new servers. There are whales that dropped so much money that they have troops 2-3 tiers ahead of you and 100k of your inferior can't beat 10k of them. Normally that is fine months into a game but 10 days into a game they finished tech that takes a month or two. If you got $$$,3
"I just started my 2nd character. I have throughly enjoyed playing this game from day 1 and have had no issues. Gems and game currency can all be found or harvested. Plenty of task to keep me busy. Animations are unique and fun. Highly suggest downloading, this isn't your average city building game!",5
A little glitches even on a newer phone but a bit better story wise as it's not all about unrealistic hot girls and just basically good old vikings so good game in my books,5
"It gets a little slow at times. Graphics are good and characters interesting. Just an update I can't get my relocater to work to get close to my tribe, what gives. The relocation problem has been fixed thank you.",4
Viking Rise is one the best strategy game I've ever played in my entire life and it's even getting better and better ..so it's a 5 star for me..no doubt,5
"The game itself is pretty good, and is similar to other kingdom building games. However, I saved 1000 gems to start my own tribe, and over the next couple of days, people started joining. Then I check to play the game, and I was removed as clan leader from my own tribe that I spent gems on. I can't even talk in chat because the chat function in the tribe doesn't work, so I can't even try to get my spot back. I put a lot of effort into building the clan, and now having nothing to show for it.",3
"Poor gaming experience. Standard fare with little to recommend it. Slow to progress initially, clunky interface and lagging issues making it virtually unplayable.",1
it is really fun to play and bunch of discoverys. So not as the adds but still fun And really not pay to win.,5
Honestly this is probably one of the best games like this. It almost brings me back to the PC game age of empires.,5
"I've been playing this game for several days. However, after the ""cannot login"" problem that ocurred yesterday, I cannot enter the game anymore, as the game is stuck on the loading screen. I hope you can fix this problem soon.",2
"Dear Developers: about the excess hero shards, is it possible to open the function of exchanging to general shards? such as 10pcs hero shards in exchange 1 general shard. as we do have lots of excess hero shards lol. Thank you. Looking forward to your feedback",5
"I really want to give this a better rating, however, after a couple weeks of playing and lots of hard work, I was absent 2 hours longer than a day and lost my Tribe. Sorry, but no. That's a hard walk for me. So much potential, but not wasting my time setting up and running a second tribe from scratch.",1
Lack of buildings makes this frustrating in terms of development I get the simple approach but my village city whatever it is looks very bare at level 10 fun somewhat entertaining just needs more options to make it resourcefully worth while collecting and sitting active on game for long periods however I find always something to do,3
"I can't enter the game, it says ""checking resource updates"" and freezes for ever",2
It's good it's fun but it's so laggy and there so many bugs hope you fix it soon,4
"It's hard to stop playing, addictive, really enjoying the game.",5
Amazing! speed upgrades and wonderful concept!,5
Please declutter the playing area! Game is good; a lot to like here. But I've had to move on cause there are so many cluttered items on the screen. Other games in this style and category do this much better than this one. Kills the game for me.,3
as an older bloke some of it is a bit hard to read and understand but overall not bad. well done,4
There's lots of network problem....my network is full nd other apps work but This game is so much struggling for run....,3
Very good game but it is highly pay to win. You cannot compete with anyone unless you pay .,3
"Good game ,but am still trying to figure out how to upgrade troops from one stage to the other.also resources sometimes get scarce",4
"It's just like ever other empire building game out there, just with a different theme. I'm not impressed",3
Best choice of gaming I downloaded. The waiting time is my only problem. Theyre to long to wait.,4
"Horrible game!! Don't waste the data to download. Limited resources, no shield for beginners to start, farming, and ego maniacs exist in this game. Total programming game developer fail. Glad it's a free game. Bad enough to consider asking them to reimburse me for the time I wasted trying it out.",1
"Finally, I've found a rehash of that one game I promised myself never to play. But this watered-down version really speaks to my Caucasian roots. I give it five stars because I'm hoping for ingame currency in another game. Basically, I'm speed running towards the requirements to get the simcash from Sim City BuildIt. Thus far, recommend.",5
Love the game but once you get to a certain level you have no protection from other players who are way beyond your level. Should be some peer to peer rules. I had to start over after getting completely wiped out.,4
From 2 fown to 1 star.. the game is totally unfair.. all the whales has infinite resources. 1 person with t7 can wipe out the whole tribes of f2p players .. which only had t5 and a some t6s.. when the whales lost battles.. its take them only 1 or 2 hours to get their 2m t7s infarmy fully recovered.. f2p players took 1 or 2 weeks gathering to recover 1m t5s in the infarmy.. whales get infinite resources from third party..,2
The game is very relaxing. The only thing I've can take away is that the beginning is very overwhelming with things to do.,4
"I like that there are no adds and that the deck is not stacked against players chosing free to play.......now, just come out with a Loki character and you might be on to something",5
"I love the game, but our server is absolutely awful. My alliance is a great team, but those that pay tons (3rd party) are ruining the game by putting their own rules in place and just burning you every 5 minutes, the top 4 tribes. More needs to be done about the bullying, really. As you can't grow. I wish we could swap servers away from these lot. Nothing is done about purchasing resources from third parties or people selling accounts.",3
I really am into this game. I only started playing today and I am already on chapter 9 it is so fun and really addicting I feel maybe only at the beginning they need to add more explanation on how to play but even if they don't the game is very easy to learn I found no faults in this game so if you are into building games this is the right game for you 5 stars from me!!,5
Well the game is kind a good with graphic and overall things. But the maine reason I'm giving 2 star is because game lag way too much every minute. This make difficult to play and affect game experience.,2
"Playing this game since the global launch, absolutely love this. Just to point out that after the recent update, the mall has disappeared from the game screen, kindly fix this.",4
I come from State Of Survival looking for a game similar but funner. I think i may have found it. I've been playing SOS almost 2 years straight but have been getting targeted by one pay to play player and its stopping me from growing and having fun. Pure menatl abuse so I've come in search of a better experience. So far im loving it! Will update soon.,5
Great game. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because some of the text is a little small (although that might be my eyes!),4
"Completely PAY TO WIN. There is no point in playing this game unless you pay. You will put hours of work in only to be plundered by a p2w player you have no chance against. Besides that. I really love the game. Fun theme and beautiful aesthetic. The events are fun and engaging! One critique would be time mechanics for upgrading increase quite drastically and too soon. I'm on level 13, and it already takes about 3 days to upgrade. Usually, this happens around level 22.",1
"The game is good when you start, however to progress you need to be part of a tribe or you just get attacked constantly. I've joined 3 tribes so far and all have had the leader go inactive after a few days. The process to dismiss an inactive leader needs to be made significantly easier otherwise I would say this game is unplayable long term.",3
I downloaded it only because of the word 'viking' I don't love it nor hate it. You might attack random people but you get nothing in return. It's been a month but i still don't get the purpose of the game just keep building up that's all. After killing the dragon you don't have any other missions left.,1
"It's good fun of course you have to eventually buy a few things but if you stay on top of it, it's a while before you need to purchase anything... But be careful because your enemies could and most likely will attack you when you aren't playing the game 🎮",4
"Very fun to play ! Graphics are pretty decent as well, definitely a game I will keep on my phone 😊 You Should Try it! If you enjoy viking stuff, and like having your own town to work on with other quests and side stuff to do, this is definitely a game for you👍",5
I really do want to give this game 5 stars but there is one problem. I simply cannot type. Whenever I tap on any text field the keypad will pop up for like2 seconds then dissappear. Fix this for easy 5 star.,1
"This would be a good concept, but the lag kills it for me too. I've verified for network issues, my connectivity is fine, emptied cash, updated game, no avail. I can't find the submit issues button either.",2
Playing on 5G kept coming up with connection lost would press ok which restarted the game. Checked my connection and was fine,1
"Really nice game. Nice graphics too. Friendly environment and easy to play. For me, the only problem is there's so many buttons. 35% of my screen are all buttons. Overall it is a nice game. 😁",4
"This is a very good game. 3D graphics, realistic wars, many islands, big army and a very very good starting screen. Very very very very very good game",5
"Only 2 stars because the game is glitchy, laggy and constantly freezes up. Cache and storage are clear. It's not my tablet, it's your game. Can't enjoy a game that doesn't run smoothly. Very annoying. Would give 5 stars if game worked properly.",2
A little obscure but dig around and you find things out to move you forward. Like many sims but different in a unique way. I just like the pace and tempered mystique... not an obscure chaos... great game!,4
It's a great game for when you're bored with amazing characters and awesome backstories for each. It's easy and fun to collect resources. I haven't gotten an ad since I downloaded it also.,5
"Excellent game. Great graphics, fun to play, keeps me entertained for hours!",5
"Very week game so disappointed. You can not develop as a jarl. You are always underatak by others. Not like Vikingard. Soon I will leave this game. So, so disappointed.",1
"It's perfect you download the app, it's really good for long car rides",5
It's a really good game but it is too complicated for me. Played it for 2 weeks and I have no idea what I am doing. Too much info all at once.,3
"This game is good in graphic and control, with storyline and great animation",5
"Ad for game doesn't match actual game, looks and acts different.",2
A nice game with very high graphics and stories better for devices having Android 9 or more,5
Now i cant upgrade any buildings..dont know if its a glitch but not entertaining at all,1
Clean Graphics. Refreshing approach to a grand staple of strategy gaming.,5
"For a new comer it whas a bit difficult to fallow the game, but wirh the prompt arrow I managed",4
Seems pretty fun so far. Made by igg who made castle clash too which was fun.,5
Problems with lagging freezing and being removed from game.,3
This game is simple but great I love graphics and battle system,4
"Very good game, easy to understand. It's a game you can get engrossed with",5
Very good game can play all the way through without much purchases.,5
"All good so far, please to reduce the bugs for old mobile phone that using 3gb ram",5
The game is superb but need any work on the graphics,4
Very impressive! I like that I can tap where I want my guys and builds to go!,5
I think they want a rating too soon I barely got int it before I could even think about playing it.,3
Best experince. Need a lil updates for controls.,5
"So much fun and things to do,, the villagers also involved much, it's great",5
"This is pretty entertaining, enjoying it so far. I like the challenge.",5
"Seemed good at first but keeps throwing a bewildering array of meaningless and unexplained stuff at you, ending up with you just clicking and waiting for you're not sure sure what... which just gets really dull.",3
The game is awesome. Hope that it can improve more so that many people would be satisfy to play this game.,4
"Awesome, lots of fun. Graphics are really nice and it runs very smooth.",5
"Beginner First Day, 4 Star Tomarrow im pos. 5 Star Rateing. If you are a Build and Train do Research,Gather Resources, And Battle type player this is the game for you. Oh also Adventure ,Travel ,Hunt, and more, much more. Pay attention to the Guides. Follow instructions they give and learning the basics about how to grow faster. Research and Technology is the key to Greatness.",5
Pretty straightforward It's very early in the game summoning seems all right I will continue to play and see where it goes on five,4
"Excellent, although a little complex at times.",4
I love it it is very interesting and i can play it anyway anywhere it is so much fun,4
"This is, as most other ads, are promising nothing in the ad actually ever happens until they have either spent actual money or have advanced to very high levels. Therefore if you don't have a expendable income stay away from this fraudulent site.",1
"One of the better strategy war and civilization games I've played and I've played a lot, but I'm still learning as well which is good. Most of these types of games are easy to figure out but this one has many facets that make it very entertaining. I think I've found a winner here !!!! I've been on here for a while now and the only issue I have is why it boots us off the server every hour or so and it does it to everyone but we deal with it because we love the game so much. But would appreciate",5
The battle scenes are the best and most user friendly of any games that I have played from this genre,3
"I've only just begun playing. Given those circumstances, my overall opinion could change. As, of now I currently enjoy the different references to the religion. I can only hope that the further I go. The more my religion is referenced accurately. Thoroughly, intertwined with the storyline of the game.",4
Not bad. Could use clearer interface though.,3
"Overall great game I enjoy the concept of it and getting to build. I appreciate all the extra supplies I get. It is slightly glitchy so that's why I put 4 stars, if only there were a 4.5 option.",4
"Much like others say, the lore in this game is absolutely insane. Very well made (also seems like theres a few women in power too!) and pretty idle if you just want to manage stuff. I saw the staff respond quickly to issues too :) Overall a nice experience, hoping to see more development in the game. Love mythology in general.",5
"This is a war game, not strategy. They don't even hide the fact that it's for powerful spenders. If you aren't careful all the time, literally glued to screen, you will be harassed by bloodthirsty whales. Farms can be destroyed easily. Gameplay is lacking balance. Game is really well made, but it's ruined by devs and players themselves. Frequency of IAP popups is sick. Also, game is overwhelmed by russians and arabs, because it's machine translated into their languages. Total language chaos.",1
"One of the best Battle game in this current world, Epic Graphical design is a great way for players to experience",5
It's another time consuming game which you can falow only way haw scenarios are designed. It's not a strategy game to me,2
When I first started playing I gave game 5 stars there was alot to do and was able to progress quickly but after reaching lvl 17 game started getting boring same old quests same old map quests same old everything now im lvl 18 build times are extremely to long and take to much rss research times are atrocious and no new anything now I know this is a game designed for pay to win players and I've spent $300.00 to date on this game but honestly it's BORING.,1
Was able to play game now it won't load. So I had to DELETE IT.fix the bigs then I might try to play it again,1
"The inevitable conclusion of the game is going to be misery for those who don't pay for the game, and for those who do pay only if their enemy is paying more. A game of throwing money on the screen to get tools for bullying others. If bullying others is your shtick and your credit card is loaded? 6/5 stars. Otherwise -2/5 stars.",1
Overall very good game. Only complaint really is I wish I could zoom in on the map a little more as My phone screen size is a little small. But all in all I say a solid 4 out of 5 stars. I usually don't play games on the phone and this is one of very few to hold my interest.,4
This game is so cool the voice acting is amazing and the storievl line is so cool best Mobile Viking game ever!!!,5
"A bit overwhelming with featured, necertheless mechanics is on point and is visually pleasing!",5
By far one of the greatest mobile game I have played. Definitely recommend Viking Rise. Keep up the great work.,5
"Edited: sorted. It was only control in itself. Had to tap the hammer to finish the construction. Original post: Seems good fun, but for me, fun ended before began. Can't build camp🤷‍♂️ it remains unfinished and tried everything i could think of. Any suggestions?",5
I really love this game. It's not hard to understand and really fun. I've played for a couple of days now. The graphics are amazing and the gameplay is smooth. I'm glad I joined the Easly Access period of this game. Best game I've played in a really long time. 10☆.,5
Great game if only there was a Freeplay where I don't get told what to but I have to reach the objectives on my own,4
Easy to get into interesting story and game play is over all fun worth trying if your looking for a clash of clans like title,5
"It is still quite derivative in my opinion. Feels like a pimped version of lords mobile, still playing I will see how it goes.",3
"It's good but higher level kills the newly joined player's and it's very hard to play in this conditions, I don't mind it cause I am in a big tribe but it's still a problem and I wanted to play with my friends but since there is I don't know what restrictions, we are in different server, well aside from that all is good, I have a levl 16 village, 1.5 mill power, I am not a pay to win player, I used something that's called patience haha but overall nice game... ❤",4
"Thanks so much! Game has lot to offer, but if your not careful some of the time you invest in it, could be another persons gain! I asked for help, didnt get any. Thanks so much. I'm done. Thank you for Responding. I will probably come back in the future just to see if things have improved and if they had then I'd probably say around a while. Thank you for reviewing the information and taking it into consideration.",3
"This game is an absolute delight. If you start playing this you ll understand the developer has put some thought into this. It is not pay to win, the game gives you a good amount of resources, speed ups, resources are available, the games needs a lot of patience buf that is the magic of such games. This is very very well developed. The paid packages are very well packaged and there is no ads 😁",5
"Great build & conquer strategy game. Easy to use and fully guided if needed. Beautiful buildings, scenery & sounds. Perfect for beginners & seasoned players. If you love battling monsters & clan's, this is a must have game app 😊",5
"Totally engrossing, dynamic and loads of fun",5
"After the update, my newly trained troops are stuck at the training buildings. No matter how i tap on it, the troops arent ""collected"". I cannot collect, train troops or upgrade my building. Help.",3
So far a good game. Good graphics and sounds,4
"This is a very good game, Graphics are really good and the events also good. You can Free to play, But your need an active alliance to clame the rewards on the events, People who are saying its only for money players don't know how to play the game and are wrong, HOWEVER!!! F2P will get you so far, after Level 20 Hall the ress and times increase, Level 25 wall will cost you 141 million in stone. Impossible if your F2P. So makers are also wrong that it's fp2. Research also same deal, So be warned",5
Graphics poor Game theme area too large according to task.,1
"Super addicting game, I just wish there was a more immersive and in-depth story.",4
It is a good game with realistic graphics and more like a adventurous challenges for Viking,4
Doesn't automatically link Google account to a game account so resets progress. It has reset my progress twice now and I'm not willing to progress again. Annoyingly it's actually quite fun to play with good graphics and a good story and activities.,2
"Everything is nice and graphics,controls are great. At first it might be hard to adopt everything but eventually its easy to understand and play.",5
"Fun game, good graphics, easy to play😊",3
Very bad rules... I started a map few months ago from the beginning... I can't explain why are so many tribes with almost maximum level all affiliated to one tribe that rule everything and it's not chance for me to rise up or even to cross the water. They acting like a cancer till will affiliate all clans and game over. I can't even change the map becouse of the chief House. I become a farm and obeying stupids rules from other. No more money in this game its waste of time and money,1
The game is fun to play and give you a fun feeling to keep playing it I love it,5
Fun solo experience. I've been looking for a game like this. With no online invasions or anything.,4
"Lovely graphics and movement, but I don't want to join up with strangers. I want to explore on my own. There's no way to do this & the global chat box covers too much of the screen to be able to ignore it. Sadly, I am installing. I had hoped this would be a great game for me.",3
"My favorite part right away was the fact that Ivor is a reference to assasins creed Valhalla, and that he's a guy. Alot of other things depict ivor as a girl. The game play is pretty chill. Just looks like the graphics could have been a bit better. I normally rate 5 stars on things cause if I enjoy it at all it deserves it. Most mobile games suck nowadays.",5
Keep auto put me into a random English chat room. Keep auto put me back again after I exit/delete the chat room. Super irritating. Unable to permanently exit from it. Just so similar to getting spammed. Not going to change the 1 star rating until this useless feature is removed.,1
This app is a cheater. I played this in earn money app. It promised to pay after reaching a specified level but it is not paying. 👎👎👎,1
Like a lot of these games. It's kept me interested so far. Usual build-up and attack games.,5
Addictive game right from the start. Can't wait for the next level.,5
Really love the graphic.. honestly im shocked how well the storyline revolved,5
"There were a lot of people talking about how the chat box was taking a lot of space on the screen even before I downloaded the game, but they still didn't fix it. The game itself was fine, it was very engaging, but the design of the controls on the screen ruins it. It just looked very clattered and looking at it was stressing me out. I hope you focus on that on your next update.",4
"Game is pretty decent, but since the new update. I got very laggy, please helpe to fix this..",4
"Great to a point. Thankyou for replying to the original rating, but typically, this is an advance as you pay game. Not advance as you play. Good to start. Drops dramatically if you choose not to use your wallet.",1
"Honestly, I'm really loving this game. Graphics are nice gameplay is pretty straightforward and there is plenty to do. It's honestly, probably the best ""City Building"" type of games I've played. 4.5/5 stars!",4
Takes to long and you have to pay to play if you want to get somewhere in the game,2
It was so fun and when you lose a fight Your base doesn't break,5
"Awesome so far, easy upgrades, keeps you busy. Will update in the future.",5
"It feels like pushing your to lvl up so you must spend money. I haven't experienced any pvp interaction yet. What I feel missing from the experience. Overall is not a bad game, good to spend some time with it.",4
"Great game so far, I hope we get new heroes soon...",5
"The graphics are really good. BUT, 1. The advertisement and rewards section are in the main screen and it's annoying. You have to play the game while there is advertisements popping up in the rewards section. They literally shove it up your face. They should move it in the shop section so we can actually enjoy the game without any hindrance. 2. The game is laggy even though I have a pretty decent phone. The UI of the game stutters quite often. The game missions gets repititive. Uninstalled.",2
"This game was great. Until my base was randomly moved away from my tribe, and I had to spend 3k gems to move it back. I reported it to the customer service team who then wouldn't explain what happened or give my gems back. Terrible game DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. Edit - I did submit a ticket and yall did nothing. Didn't give me my jems back or even explain why it randomly moved me. You guys suck.",1
"Its nice to play, but i rate it 3 for now because i still not play all the mid story yet 👍",3
This game is really good😊. I am enjoying it very much. There are some many things we can do. But please it's a request don't change this game 🙏. It is perfect. There so many games that were really amazing but after some updates they got worse. So please don't change this game. Really enjoying it😉. Keep up the good work💯.,5
So far so good. I'll give most Viking games a try. I'm glad I did with this one. It really helps to have the flashing drop pins to show me what is needed to be done next or to help explain things about the game for the slow learners like myself.,5
"Great graphics but that's about it. Gameplay has so many bells and whistles it's all very overwhelming. I've had years of experience playing rise of empires, so I can only imagine how first timers would feel playing this style of game for the first time. Hero development seems complicated. Game can only be played in landscape mode which makes things tedious for various actions. Have uninstalled game and returned to playing rise of empires. It's simpler.",3
So far it's good. A little bit wordy with some in game descriptions but overall it's good.,4
"Fun game, great to pass the time on road trips and then secretly attack my wife's village. Hahaha having a blast",5
It became frustrating to play this game as I would always be stuck at loading at every touch...train troops? Loading...do errands? Loading...gather resources? Loading...Fight? Loading...it's always loading to the point that I can't even do all of it...,2
"Well,only crashed once but not after I reinstalled. Will add more when I'm further in game.",4
The game quality is good.... The problem is from the beginning there is too much resources required in order to upgrade buildings and train infantry.... Don't even get me started on research. And as a free to play player you are doomed to be left behind due to these constraints. This game has potential but a ton of improvements have to be made.,1
At the moment disappointed because the game hasn't been able to update for several weeks. I've more attempt then I'm deleting,2
I'm liking it so far. It is like other games I've played. Having g no issues at this time.,5
By far definitely one of the best games that I have played in a very long time even for mobile far as like being able to upgrade your troops or anything like that I like being able to do it myself and not like have to have like be told to do it I like doing everything you know but definitely a good game recommended for anybody play it bro might like it,5
"Was really fun, I love the story and building up my tribe. But other people got in the way, love having this one rando target me six times or more in a row and leave me unable to do anything, had to rage quit and undownload because they wouldn't stop",2
Several hours in and it's really fun. Build and conquer no BS in-between.,4
Almost nothing like the video of the game that this is supposed to be the graphics that are shown in the demo has nothing to do with how the graphics are in the it's a little bit fun of fun but nothing like what they showed us I just wish that they would be honest instead of lying.,3
"Compared to a possibly more popular app, this one is better! You can build/craft multiple things at once, it's generous with rewards for doing tasks- even though I've only just started playing, i can tell I'd play this one more than the other. I can also tell that this game has more heart to it so keep at it!! :)",5
"Crashes ALOT... Edit. Uninstalled due unable to play, freezes,lags,crashes.",1
Well I'm figuring it out.. not that it's complicated as just knowing what to tap and when. And it seems as you go that gets better not more boring like other games there's always more to do I just have to find more time to do it,5
"excellent game you should add a group multiplayer battle mode so we can get more gems,coins or hero points.",5
"Good game graphics , easy to play.. This the best game i played ever among this kind of games. Faster growth when you join a powerful tribe. @IGG kindly do some better on next update Add the 'Mount' feature. @sometimes when we are scorling the game it's lagging do some fix of this issue.",5
Fun and addicting. Love the viking play in it all.,5
"You don't have a means to restart the game from scratch, therefore this is the worst game I've ever played I even deleated the game and info off my phone and reinstalled it and ended up back in the game I was previously playing instead of starting new otherwise the game might have been ok",1
"The game is fun at start, until you realise how much it is p2w. The game will throw you $10 - $20 packs everyday almost, and while it's fine to spend a few dollars here and there some people take it to the extreme. In our kingdom one guy maxed out completely, he's might is 100mil and he can solo tribes that are 800mil by himself, and even if he loses half his troops he will just heal again with $$$ and continue on. Where's the fun in that? P2W is extreme, stay away from this game.",1
"This is a very easy to get caught on game, nice narrative and graphics, easy to get a lot of resources to keep you playing for hours without purchase.",5
this game is getting boring... the rewards from the missions are not worth it and not seen as a strategy game.,1
"Good game. People complaing about lag, get more powerful phone/tablet. Also, u can only be logged into your account on one device. So if you're using a tablet, and want to continue playing on your phone you can't. Unless you don't mind logging out of your tablet. And you can't enjoy this game on a small phone, so you're kinda stuck playing it on your tablet 100% of the time. And if you don't create an account at all, your phone will think you're starting fresh and start you from the beginning.",5
"I'm struggling to get into the game for nearly a day already. I already spoke with the contact staff and they said it will be fixed soon... Within one week I've had several failed attempts to login. This is not a good start as a new player. If we can't actually play the game, then its not worth our time or money.",2
I waited for a game like this for ages. Classic strategy in the Viking era. The only thing what is missing are English and French maybe to fight them. All in all an awesome well optimised game. Hope the log in problem will be fixed soon.,5
"I've been playing for only 3 days, so what i can say so far is that i enjoy the gameplay and storyline so far. Things are getting more and more complex so i look forward to see how it evolves. Good job devs!",5
Forever to level up. One fight and all the troops are gone. This a money grab.,1
"Please change the 10 hero exp. button, we would like to upgrade our heroes, in my case, I have tons of hero exp., especially 10 hero exp. It's hard to upgrade using it.",3
Very fun to play keeps the mind busy....awesome The only issue I have is that its not PC compatible,5
"Decent graphics, unique events and some useful features. However, cant share screenshots in the chat. Rally enemies cant be searched on map. Very LOW hero xp gained to lvl up, no xp gained after gathering. Always vulnerable even inside territory. Expensive healing with 18-20K wounded troops you'll have to use over 1M of each rss so good luck trying to have fun. No equilibrium between Whales & F2P players so average you'll be a farm for others because defenses as bubbles are rare/expensive.",2
"Great strategy, great plot, characters and everything is worth 5 stars i find myself addicted to this game inplay it every day as it's fun but what makes it more fun is the community inside the game. I am in kingdom server 36 and we established an organized kingdom with 4 ruling tribes and a discord server.",5
"great game, good graphics, easy to play",5
"Fun...until the whales show up. Just another game that's ruined by people with deep pockets who want to show off their e-peen. Found a fun clan, was enjoying scavenging and clamoring for territory, then the whales showed up and destroyed it all...like they do in every game where you can buy power. I know, cry more, right? It's just another game to take your couple weeks of attention and a few of your hard earned dollars before the lack of content and super e-peeners ruin it and you uninstall.",1
It's a good game but my friend is in other kingdoms how can we play together we want to make the clan but we can't because we are in different kingdoms this is not right you have to make a way so that if some friends want to play together they can play.plz give use one time to relocate if we want to play with our friends u guys give it but only for lvl5 what about other those are in higher lvl this is not a good thing,1
Wonderful game but dan you add more realistic graphics and It has many bug but I am not giving 4star I am giving 5star because you do your best😁😁,5
"One of the best strategy game I've ever played!.the graphics are excellent,gameplay is wonderful.glad to know that the Dev Team are working really hard into this game.I hope more good stuffs are waiting for the players in the future!.Kudos to YOU all!!.cheers and salute!.",5
Game can be fun. But will get repetitive fast. Progress will slow 5o a crawl after so many levels. It makes for a good time killer,3
"good thing you improved the lag in updates on android but it's still crashing sometimes, and the keyboard are too slow to appear after playing for 30 minutes. Please improve this :/",3
"Addictive. The only problem I have is that the heroe's capacity to hold troops is very low and it really spends time for upgrade, so annoying",4
Still new and in the beginning but so far so good just don't like that I always seem to run out of supplies quickly without really getting to upgrade much.,4
"Good game , having fun playing it but it's sometimes hard to gain hero's level after 40 levels too much points needed for those who dosen't buy, otherways it's good",3
As of right now it has been way better than Clash of clans I feel as if I'm progressing at a much faster rate and gaining materials faster as well. Hopefully it keeps getting better as my progression continues,4
Not bad to me at all. Love the graphics game play Is cool. It's a little different than the other games that just want you to pay to build. 4 stars from me.,4
"Actually pretty fun, downloaded it just to get some points on mistplay but have genuinely enjoyed the aesthetic and the ambient sound is quite good I just leave it running while I'm making food sometimes",4
Very good game make more graphic or upgrade village or going in ship or attack on enemy make more interesting please 🙏,5
So far so good easy to progress so far and there is always something to do at the start but for now no complaints,4
"So far, it's good with the potential to be great. Love the graphics, the theme, and the music. Pretty user friendly UI; can't seem to find a way to delete any of the private messages in chat. I've had trouble with a little lag, but the worst part is it's been crashing over and over. Still working with support on this issue.",3
"The game start to lag out of sudden since yesterday,its very annoying and i cant play,pls fix asap...",3
It's fun so far as long as it stays free!,4
It's a great game keeps a person feel the tribe atmosphere but add more trees and speed ups.,5
Fun easy to play nice graphics.,4
No real way to gather resources only what tiny bit on map after leveling up main house total waste of time,1
In starting its nice but after few days later when we enter the its loading only even I have full signal and data its just irritating,1
"Fun game, same format as other games. I like the fantasy, norse enviorment.",4
I like this game good graphics and awesome storyline and one thing that makes it great is it is online,5
"Viking rise is one of the top best strategy games I have ever played there's tons of cool characters and the graphics are beautiful, I await to see what the future holds for this game shout out to the developers of this game I love the game so much and thank you for making this game I hope you continue you're great work and yeah that's it I rate it ∞/500 because I just love it🤩❤️",5
"This is a great game (especially for fans of Civilization/Age of Empires, etc.). The graphics and gameplay are very good. They desperately need to improve how you move buildings in your city, and I would recommend they decrease the amount of things there are to do, as it's overwhelming, especially for more casual gamers. I think the global map could be streamlined, as I dislike how complicated that aspect of the game is, although I'm still learning. The single-player gameplay is perfect.",5
This is an amazing game it doesn't lag or have adds its so fun to play,5
"No ads, yay! But once a server dies or is overrun by tyrannical tribe leaders set to ruin everyone else on the server, it becomes unplayable and you can't transfer your progress to a different server. So if you've paid for packs and purchased heroes you lose it all when joining a new server. And FYI, the game isn't anything like the ads which is misleading. I would have kept playing if server life was fair & balanced, more like the ads, and you could keep your progress when changing servers.",2
"Very easy to play. A little on the slow side right now, but I just started. Hopefully it picks up a bit.",4
"The developers were too excellent to create such masterpiece, also the graphics and gameplay were interesting and unique. However, the combat system was too plain and blunt it seems like I'm not involve on the combat system and just letting my heroes and warriors die without my help. I can't even use their skills or know what kind of enemy are their facing. However, the game was excellent and I rate it a 5 stars",5
Very nice game. The graphics and the story. Adventurous.,5
Begin is fast and awsome but end game is super bored unless you have money to burn and easy to overcome any f2p grinder in any event.,1
"This is a game I could really get into. I'm enjoying a lot so far. Not very far in, but I think it's a keeper.",5
Enjoying game. It will keep you busy. Alot to do.,5
Still learning but having the best time so far. Thank you... All blackhawks matter!,4
"A game without ads... theres a surprise, reminds me of CnC mixed with AoE...",4
Lags and freezes way too much even after update. Bye bye,1
Great everything. Very much borrowed from Rise of Kingdoms and thus has improved on the latter's experience. This game has great potentials.,5
It's really fun and enjoyable game. Especially to pass time.,5
"The game has become very annoying, gets stuck, and does not work as well as it did before",5
"Lovely graphics, easy to follow story.",5
Sooo much fun! Keeps your interest engaged. Nice work Devs!,5
"Grown up in the 90s, this kind of reminds me of age of empirish. What's the little bit of a modern twist to it?",4
"Very poor and badly copied game, is A Pay To Loose, there's no win, poor pve, very poor pvp, poor management, maintenance in wrong time(During Event) and all things in game is developed for you to spend money",1
"similar to other games, same buildings for upgrading things. just a way to waste your time and eventually when the concurrence comes you quit the game and go to another",3
So far it's fantastic everything is good about this game reward system is also awasome,5
"Cool gameplay, storyline, and adaptive to user preferences.",5
"The graphics are nice. But ultimately this is yet another grind to win/pay to win game. Take your choice. There is almost no skill or strategy required. Battles are one dimensional and depend on troop numbers or hero level. City management is repetitive rounds of endless upgrades and pretty pointless side quests that just require clicks to solve. The number of things to do seems great to start with, but soon becomes repetitive. The intrusive upselling of micro transactions is also unfortunate.",2
"Amazing I would give it a 9/10 great graphics amazing gameplay well thought out, decently paced game",5
It became so good if you add some more battle fields instead of some islands.....,5
"So funn and enjoyable, the gameplay is nice and I love the narrating storyline. Enjoying it a lot I highly recommend if you want to play some fun yet not stressful games",5
Not enough food and wood to building. But it feel empire.,5
No cap this game is great it brings out the joy of the old viking day's and the way it is it's just amazing no complains about it,4
Fun..im in my hall 5..hoping the game will be fun until higher level of hall and im still learning,5
Nice graphics. Good strategy game. Made lots of friends!,4
"it's a superb game. you should give it a chance, even the graphics r good",5
Pretty in depth and no ads!,4
Great hard game. You have to build and upgrade a village. Rescue people and gather resources. This is one of my favourite games to play when I am bored. Well done to the developers for creating that great game.,5
It's good as you find out about movement and battle at the same time,5
"It's an addictive game, lots of good people, and I love it. But it would be nice if it had a tribe voice chat.",4
Why am I being logged out time and again... Is there some issue with server? Rest all apps working fine.,3
"Good graphic, good gameplay, simple to follow.. enjoying the game.",4
I love this game because is have a enemy but honestly i lose that alright see you this time i want to play again (rate 10000/100) ⭐⭐⭐⭐🌟🌟🌟,5
A very good game so far. Will come with next feeds let me do some couples upgrades on my missions then will comment.,5
Its very nice game. It does jot annoy you with ads and its rewads are very fare.,5
"Good, but it's too expensive to continue playing. Shame really because it looked promising. So, my search continues",3
A really great game and it has improved since early access. Keep up the great work.,5
"So far so good not been playing long, very nice graphics everything working as should so far",4
Nice game but you can add more features like tax and sawmill farm quary.But great game keep it up.,4
Great game but lacks a little lower the graphics so that everyone can Play easily,5
The coolest.and funnest build your own city game. A mix between survival and castle building game,4
"if you are playing this game to get rewards for another I wouldn't bother,I am waiting for thousands of gems for reaching certain levels which I obviously ain't gonna get",1
This game is a very good game and with excellent graphics the gameplay is very good and the story lion super I enjoyed the game,5
It starts loading itself amidst the game and it is quite annoying...fix it guys,3
"I just started playing the game yesterday and fell asleep not because of the game but I was sleepy but so far so good, hats off to the devs.",5
"Well polished, graphically pleasing and a nice learning curve.",5
"Great past time, graphics, and easy play. Well worth it",5
The Mount Features can't unlock right now.. So I am requesting you please unlock the Mount Features asap,4
The best. So addictive and very good for strategic simulation.,5
Exceptional quality of product and quality of game play is superfluous Vikings onwards!!,5
it is a really good game but kind of a copy of rise of kingdoms still a very fun game for those who like vikings,4
Graphics are good but i got glitch when start the game so now I unable to play this game,1
"Amazing game, fast growth at the start, and alliances are active fast growing and fun!",5
I Am Revising My Review Of This Game It's A Lot Of Fun If'n U Have The Time A Bit Slow But It Makes Up For That With The Fighting And All Of That Jazz $$$???!!!🫡🤔😊🤫🫣🫢🤭🤗🤑😝😜😛😋🥲😙😚☺️😗😘🤩😍🥰😇😀😉🫠🙃🙂😂🤣😅😆😁🤡👽👾👹👺💀☠️👻👿...,5
Game is kept on loading again again and able toh perform any function in the game.,1
The graphics are pretty cool it is hard to gather resources,4
Nice game and keep you bussie in different situations never let you bored Really addictive game.,4
It's very good game grinding game and power grinding etc and suggestion keep your work like this game will grow next level,5
"Graphic design is very nice, but game play not uotp the Mark.",1
Very good game and very much enjoyed it so very useful to the team and a great team and a great deal of all the time and effort taken into account and to keep in contact with you as I am unable to connect to the Internet without a phone or phone number is on my phone and I am not sure if I can get a phone number or call you 5 I am not sure if I can get a phone number or call you on my mobile number on my phone and I am not sure if you have been able to call me on your mobile phone number as it,5
I love it every thing is perfect but one thing is that is hard to level up 😭,5
Reminds me of age of empires III. Plus who doesn't like Vikings? Great job developers!,5
Easy to undestand the mechanics of the game. Highly recommended,5
A little like Rise of Kingdoms in gameplay.. a little laggy but it's something to get by,4
Beast pen needs to be add in your game i unable to access the taming area because of this.,1
"Easy to pick up, smooth, and inventive.",5
"Game works but it's just the same thing with new skin, nothing new, on rails.",4
Very good game just wish you could zoom on the characters better that's all,3
it's a very fun game but it can glitch and it's really annoying but apart from that it's a very good game.,4
It's ok... Not the most exciting though .. and kind of slow going..,3
"Game is good. clear bright graphics. Its smooth,I like it",5
So far so good a good game not bad easy to build gather and attack others I like it.,5
Good game but it's a pain to click gather things and having to find my collecters then click to do it,5
Like this game but the one issue is if you put on hight or medium on grapich you stuomaticaly get kick out,4
Cool game upgrades takes a bit long but actually pretty good for a mobile game,4
"It's a good and interesting game, just some few bugs but it's not bad at all",4
"Excellent experience.Nice texture and graphics.Better than that fake game ""Lords Mobile "".",5
I have been playing from 3 months advertisement on main interface are irritating,4
It's cool but I would like it if the enemy's would be easier to beat,5
Good game disappointing developers. Developers do not care about any issues you raise but more outrageous they do not care about player safety. The do not take action if you report inappropriate or threatening behaviour. Think twice before downloading other games care more about players,3
The rate of player growth on new servers to fast very unbalanced,4
"Great game, loads of fun, just a slow start, but you'll get there",4
Just started to play. I like the building and battle features so far,4
"Hello, this game is wonderful, please add Persian language to the game for us too We can improve our village in a better way",5
I am not able open the game and it's throwing an error.,1
It's helping pass the time at work and not too monotonous.,5
"Super fun to play so far, really enjoying the simple game play",5
Only just started so still learning. I'll update later but so far seems smooth.,4
This game is basically a mix between Age of Empires and RPGs.,5
"New, fresh easy to play the game and makes you think strategies",4
Nice game but i have a problem in the first place i didn't know that this game need a connection and the game was so lag,3
Good game and doesn't push you to spend money constantly which is refreshing,5
I've only been playing for about a week but this is a really fun game that does a lot of things right.,5
Pretty fun + no ads and that makes it an amazing experience,5
A bit hard to get resources at the beginning so it's hard to lvl,4
Still the best game related even with live customer resolution service keep up the good work.,5
"So far it's moving steady yeah, decent handles and quality. Waiting on seeing more of the story line but I've just begun. I may or may not be back with another review.",4
"I liked the game at first, but at my 3th day I log in I lost motivation to continue, because there is too much to do so I don't now what to do. City management, two different maps to conquer, worker management, clans, research, clan research, city resources, clan resources, hero management, some random another map with some quests and many more... Don't get me wrong, I like all of them, but I had feeling like playing 3 different games in one. Reduced to 1* for stupid and false advertisement.",1
Love this game reads to you and love the story line and the guided quest,5
I guess I like it so far. I've only been playing for less than an hour. Maybe they should wait a week before they ask us to rate it.,3
Its a very nice game if ur searching for peace or quiteness but the main problem is the ads,5
"It's basically a carbon copy of the zombie game, the ants game and the spaceship game. It's free until it gets fun than you're stuck either waiting days or paying for stuff meanwhile at the end anybody who just pays an obscene amount of money is going to essentially own the server with the highest level cleanse and will be able to dictate rules. Since you can't solo the game and need a clan you're basically stuck playing high school politics with prima donnas in order to have an experience.",3
It takes too much time to work. This makes it boaring game,1
This game is pay to win. Don't download this game it requires an absurd amount of money to win in this game or else someone else will overpower you. Other players abuse you just because you are not in there tribe.,1
Great game so far! Keeping me busy and didn't even spend a penny.,5
"Fun, keeps progressing at tolerable speed.",5
Nice free trial of the game and a good story bylined,5
For everyone complaining im a free to play player and I have top 2 tribe And is highly respected Maybe just get better at diplomancy and politics,5
Good game. Fast but understandable gameplay. 4.5 stars.,4
text is a little small but good game,4
It could be better if it's not buffing. But that's my bad Internet problem,5
"It's a Viking themed p2w game dominated by huge clans with platinum credit cards and bad personalities. Avoid this game if you dont wish to spend hundreds every month. If IGG would create a non-pvp side where people could just be left alone and resource build, even create a single player empire builder, then I'd throw money at this game. As it is now, I'm not interested.",2
The grafics are great and it's a great way to become part of a tribe and make friends,5
Smoothing background music 🎶. Please give it a try to this game really enjoyable,4
It's a bit slow to when you open the app but other than that it's a great game,4
"It has all i need fighting,building,disovery and everything else so thank u",5
"The best so far... A totally P2W game, good at any aspects & Server 9 give F2P to come & play, gathering rss in peace... 5 stars for the richie...",5
I enjoyed it! This is the kind of strategy game I'm looking for! It got history!,5
This game is actually good. But the characters only few and inactive players,1
"This game is a masterpiece with the best graphics and a lot of functionality. I would ask that you include hero battle arenas with enemy hero and include some hot hero characters in the game. Finally, I'd like to encourage you to download this game because it's fun and addictive. Developer can you please add ROMANCE mod?",5
"Im a pure (for good and bad) Norseman, direct decendant, so I wear my ""viking"" heritage proudly. This game doesn't start out good. The names of the characters are slavic and modern English names, not the correct northern germanic names we had and still have. The accent is also very wrong when they talk, also more of slavic nature and definitely not our old nordic way of pronouncing word. So, the feel of the game from the start was not at all a viking game feeling.",3
"It might be fun, but there's too much dialogue to start. Then I just see a drawn out tutorial taking place and me tapping where it tells me to tap. No thanks.",3
Oh my god this game is incredible as soon as I loaded the game and heard the music I knew I was in for a good game the graphics dialogue and features are awesome I still have so much more too do and already admire this game if you like medieval kind of games this is the one for you!,5
"I've been playing this game for about 2 hours now. So far, and I'm really enjoying it. There's not really any ads or anything like that. Pop-up and it can be completed quickly. I really enjoy that, and it's a very fun strategy game. I enjoy it, and it's not pushing me to spend actual cash so That's extremely pleasing.",5
Would be a good game if it wasn't a copy of another. I've played a game exactly like this. Would be even better of a game if it wasn't a multiplayer game and people didnt attack and taking your stuff. It would be great if it was more like the tv show it wanted to show it had to do with. Definitely a disappointment. Loads too slow.,1
"Pretty cool game. I joined it a little over a month ago can't stop now. Plenty of stuff to do. I played for free for the first few weeks, since I have dropped 5 here and there. Free is definitely a little slower, but doable.",5
"Big massive lag at the moment, everytime I log in in the past 30-45 mins been nothing but lag followed by the inevitable kick from the game back to my homescreen, it needs patched up big time, also still waiting for the patch that allows you to have tameable beasts that you have unlocked within your city (in which I had to free from the Niflungs in order to advance) and yet doesn't allow me to use them, not nice at all, please fix ASAP",2
"I really hope that there's a certain minimal changes in the buildings while you upgrade them, so that you can feel it. Great game tho, I'm really enjoying it.",4
gameis run by the orientals in the far East and they jamming everybody's game on purpose to where they can't play.Game freezes and locks you out . Have. To restart phone to do anything. Will not let you exit game just freeze your phone were you can't do anything. Stay away from this one . Has scammer's written all over it . Another thing foreign game very few English speaking player's.. And they do not help you with advice on nothing. Terrible game,1
"Great game, kind of like Whiteout Survival or Lord's Mobile but less cartoons. There's always something you can do, unlike other some other games with similarities. It doesn't have crazy wait times or anything.",5
"Game's great. Spent most of my time playing it but there's one thing i need to suggest. Instead gaining nothing when you received the same hero you already owned, can you atleast exhange it for hero shards? I'll be a great help for us.",2
"As game it's OK,I played 7 years ago exact the same game but instead of vikings it had medieval knights. Anyway the big problem is the pay to win system and the Bots. The bots don't help the game,players pay some peeps that know how to use scripts, and the deal is 100m rss per 10 dollars.. they company has to be strict and not allow these things to pass. 1/5 because in this game they are not rules but instead the players makes the rules",1
Just started and I simply love it. So far graphics are very good and points are easy to obtain. Having fun with free jewels too!!!,5
"It's so boring game i hv ever played,,for upgrading player's or building it takes 2-3 day's,,nd upgrading level of the players requires a lot of energies,, it's so freaking boring game,,never recommend to install it...jst waste of time...",1
"This game is really fun, but it's not like the ads. The ads make it look so much fun, but when you download it you will play it for hours (maybe) it's better than the ads. And the best thing, it doesn't have ads!",5
This game is amazing high quality graphic yes that is very awesome it's just great the game but this game need some bug fixing and Leech fixing and plus more fixing and the game need more high quality and making characters female and male there bodies sexualize and sexy also make male and female characters beautiful and handsome if you just make that that will be the best thing ever so pretty please to that please and the game is 10 / 10 and very good IGG 😁,5
"After playing this for a couple weeks, it's great, a few time walls, but there is plenty of stuff to do to keep playing the game, can play free and not have game ruined by pay2win players",5
"The game is actually really good and surprisingly accurate to the ad! I have so much fun playing this game, it has a cool game play, good graphics, good upgrades and many more cool things.",5
This game is one of the best damn games ever. It's simple gameplay but they offer so much to do. This is a good time passer and it's fun when I play. Been addicted since I downloaded the game so props to the developers.,5
"I was born in 1979. Played all the different consoles, from. ZX spectrum, Nintendo, commador 64. Playstation, Xbox, pc. My 1st pc was purchased was for for age of empires. This game is absolutely amazing, enjoying every element. Great job.",5
This game is awesome man.. the graphics are next level. I played many games but this game is on another level . The games I played those don't have good graphics but this game have . I appreciate your team to make this . Thank you,5
"Learning and exploring in this game never stops . Warthy download , super graphics and love the game. Only the ones with brain can play it",4
Amazing storyline so far! I really love how smooth the gameplay is. It is by far not a pay to win game and has many amazing features that I have not yet tried. 👌,5
"Terrible game, this honestly. Don't waste your time ive spent £3,000 on this but no more the lagging is horrendous im in kingdom 81 and there's these things called scripts & plug in a lot of people use in 81 to get cheap resources when im buying them in the in-game shop lol I played a month & this is the reality it has extreme lag, people cheat buy resources from plug in & scripts, the full game is a robbery it should be illegal it lags so bad you have to restart in battle & lose everything",1
"Game is good but the system is unfair. If you have money you can just ruin others gaming experience. Their costing system is very poor. This game will not survive more if you can not bring fair gameplay. While other games whose are prospering actually earn by selling hero skins, base design etc. Not like yours.. Just buy everything to become powerful and destroy others.",1
Great ap might have played longer but apparently i didnt download it right so mistplay wont reward me for it might as well play ANY OTHER RTS. Tho this one has amazing graphics and the story has spoken audio dialogue. 5* but im bitter i had to quit the game lol,3
"looks like a good game, graphics are cool. but, before i go any further to meet my disappointment is this a game that i am gonna get squashed by people that r 20 levels ahead of me and pay hundreds of dollars to kill the rookie. is it worth the effort?",3
Firstly i give it best strategy game review but now i am so much disappointed because many times it doesn't start on my 4G network and showing message that network error....now i have given it 2 star and even the problem will not solve i will decrease the rating...,2
The game is good but the only one thing i find annoying in this game is .. to start any rally you need to wait atleast 5 mins and for multiple rallies it's way too much ... Please give option of 1 minute also so one can choose as per his/her requirement,4
"After spending about more than $100 in this game, took a nap and got wiped out by someone who paid 10x more than me. Im talking about Might/Power Score here. There are no resource producing buildings here and since its a Viking game, it encourages you to raid other players for their resources. Im done with this game. The ones who spend a lot here are at a huge advantage. Imagine you spent hours training your troops only to get wiped under 10 minutes by someone who paid more than you.",1
"Fun game, I actually found it to easy tho. Got bored around the T3 troop level. Only took 3 days as a F2P player. An my T2 troops killed the entire T3 PVE zone which was kinda lame. Its a very balanced & fair game tho. Better than most in this genre!",5
Still to new to game to give a review..so far is interesting. This is another of the Many pvp town/city bubble on a big map to clan up and attack one another. If into that and don't mind IAP to keep up its a decent looking game.,3
"This game is quite exciting.😁I've only played it for a few hours but it's given me a good idea of how the whole game works.I'm able to make my own strategic planning to ensure my clan stays safe, if otherwise it's becauseI didn't make good enough planning.😁",5
"Game progress can be bought by paying which is not fair but understandable. But all the events you can earn points by just paying which is pathetic. No strategy, no viking, it's about who clicks the pay button more.",1
One of the best game after clash of clan. I like graphics and all statistics about this game. Have played this kind game before. But compare to that this one is amazing. I am so excited to discover more in this one.,5
A very fun way to pass time. This game is not only easy to learn how to play the graphics are great and the sfory is good too. A great viking experience,5
"NO POINT IN CONTACTING DEVELOPMENT. TRASH CAN GAME! Freezes, crashes and full of bot accounts. Development team isn't worried about anything other then developing more content for a cost. They need to fix their game.",1
"Graphics is good. No map, where you have to kill level 1, etc. enemy. Everything is in chapter task.",5
"Worthless game due to hard to get resources and extreme research times.. 11 hours for a T2 warrior, after having to spend time getting previous research to level 3.... UNINSTALLING FOREVER AND NEVER PLAYING AGAIN",1
"Atleast its advertised to what its supposed to be not a bad game good graphics, city building is good too the wait times can be extreme, but it's a good game with only a few flaws. Ps. I'm writing this review for gems but I thought to atleast be honest",4
This game is seriously fun I can't stop playing it lol... definitely would recommend highly with glow praise and adoration!! If your on the fence rn about installing this game or another game then I would strongly urge you to take this vikings game out for a spin if you enjoy world building strategy action games then this is your jam!!,5
One of the best game I have played ever. Looking for more updates and different seasons. Night mode is awesome 1000 times better than clash of clans. Love the game very much.,5
"I like the game for the friends that I have made, and it has some fun stuff to do. However there isn't much strategy because as with all these games, money wins. Maybe one day we will get a game like this where we can actually see who's the best and not who can spend the most. Today isn't that day.",3
"Great graphics, gameplay, and start, it gets more time consuming after awhile with all of the building queues but good game all in all.",5
"I love this game. If I was to critique it I believe there's not enough death or killing. In a game of war/ divide and conquer, you would think there'll be a lot more death in a lot more killing.",4
"Good graphics, interesting to play (already 3 days). However, the gameplay sometimes doesn't look like common sense.",4
Multiple attacks on same enemy is so much time taking that's why troops loss their energy and loss battles and this is big issue 2nd thing is that hero's traning is so slow very less experience they gained in long time.game is going boaring now,2
Still in the midst of playing but enjoy the content so far.The UI and game play remind me of pretty much everything else in it's genre on Android. I Will edit my review when I've formed more of an opinion later on.,3
"This game is difficult to upgrade, especially when you are already level 19, to reach level 20 if you are a free player it feels impossible. How can you upgrade if the highest RSS is only level 4? And limited stamina",2
"I was enjoying the game, but when I logged on to play a 2nd time, everything was gone, all of my progress, gone, plus I'd rather skip the story telling, but cant.",1
The servers die too quickly People leave about a week and its very boring So few battles are fought in altars and lairs. Most of the alliances are dead only the big ones are alive due to lack of players! Please fix this issue! We still need people coming in servers! You are making it too quickly.,1
"Really good game, but it's not fully working properly when i am building, upgrading, or training the timer doesn't work properly when i am not on the game and how hard it is to get ivor shards and how much you have to pay to get ragnar other than that i cant really fault the game please sort this and make this game amazing",3
"I love the theme, I'm in a great tribe, but it's stupid expensive to upgrade. Also it got really boring really fast, most of the server has left within a month out boredom",2
"A great game, absolutely amazing from the graphics, gameplay, story, characters etc. you can't stop playing.",5
"Aristotle believed that motion required a continuous external force and that objects in motion had a natural tendency to come to rest. Galileo, on the other hand, believed in the concept of inertia and that objects in motion would remain in motion unless acted upon by an external force.",5
"Major issue with bugs, after updates and cleared cache still bugs, after restarting reloading the games several times. Still have issues logging into igg account from switch accounts screen.",1
A very good game I had no troubles but the only problem is the recource it is very tough to get and someday you will need to spend gems (Gems are free) to buy troops that's what im going through right now overall good game no bugs/lags and glitches good work devs,5
I really enjoy your game I am having lots of fun playing it. But I did notice that when you guys sent out the last update I have noticed that the game has crashed quite a lot since the last update I'm wondering if there's still something. Would enjoy to still play the game,5
"This game has very good graphics,clean fights and it is entertaining but the only reason am giving 2 stars is this game is pay to win.I have spend weeks to get to certain might but some random guy who spents money gets millions of might in just a week.Not only that those money spenders are toxic and bully the week players.The game could be the best build and strategy game but these pay to win feature need to go.I had a great entertaining week but got ruined in matters of seconds.",2
Please add new Landscape to explore feeled with new Challenges to? Also I think you should create a part 2 of the Game for the all Ages. Thanks for letting me play with the Game.,5
Loving the game play everyday just to upgrade the village. In this game being attacked this not so bad. It also has perks . Very interesting to play and loving the updates 🧐,5
Wish they would add an option to turn off night. The screen just has a dull look across everything and hard to see on a mobile outside.... just horrible,3
"Game graphics and features are outstanding 😜 but need more actions on key's like age of empires types, I'm enjoying this game, great work by developers.😘",4
"Enjoying it so far...typical play style of other games in this genre but, the viking look and feel is pretty cool...more of a storyline...interesting and fun.",5
"I'm two days into the game. So far it's been amazing and exciting. Well developed world, game mechanics and most importantly - the graphics.",5
"19/05/2023 Seems like a awesome game, but it lags terribly on my device and eats my battery power and DATA. Deleting after only a few days of play. Too frustrating to wait for everything to load.",2
"It's a fun game, with a lot of promise, but it is definitely based on high-level micro transactions to really keep up with player growth.",3
The developer authorises purchases you didn't purchase. Google then issue a refund and the developers then demand you pay them directly for the purchases or they will block you leaving you unable to use the content you actually paid for. Customer service are terrible.,1
"I can't stop playing it it's amazing and graphics are excellent, the voices are charming. I am already feeling like a Viking...",5
This one of the best games I've ever played in years the music the story the overall fact that the adds are similar to actual gameplay it's amazing and also...NO FRICKING IN THE MIDDLE OF GAMEPLAY This is the best feature of all all I have to say Peace Out.Ima child BTW,5
"Bigger tribes overrun smaller tribes. Not by playing smarter because they only fight small players instead of other big players. There is nothing to go for for smaller tribes who enjoy smaller groups for the interaction... even buying things in the game, you still get overrun. It's time developers do something about it.",1
"Nothing like advertised, constantly crashes- even the ads crash. Not worth the time or effort to download.",1
"Not really sure what the negative reviews are as this game has been amazing. Graphics, no lag, no pay to win. Easy to grind a little and level up.",5
"Game play is okay. Night mode is hard to see to play. Also a summary queue of what is idle would be helpful (training soldiers, builders, etc)",4
It's a fun game and all. Gathering all the resources is so easy and simple. I would recommend this game to everyone. The only problem is that there is barely any way to heal the lightly wounded Vikings.,4
"Love the game but stopped a month ago due to busy times at work. Came back, and all my progress was reset. Supports only suggestion was ""keep trying all of your accounts""",1
"Looking good so far, have not gotten very far into it yet but am enjoying making my little viking outpost. Good time killer for bus journeys, and there's alot more to it than I thought there would be.",4
great game. love the texture and the way it auto upgrades the village at times when all achievements are finished.,5
"It is a fun game but it is so much like all the games set up like this. I give it 4 stars, I would have givin 5 stars if this game would have had something unique. Overall its a fun game tho.",4
"Almost there. The app just needs to be optimized, the frame rate is also a problem, lags often occur but it's a fun game.",4
The game was beyond amazing. But let me do everything solo. I have to beat 10 niflum level 1 but after 2 weeks no teammate or any other tribe will join to help. If not changed asap I'm uninstalling,2
The game is good the main problem is updates every few days this for a game is unacceptable I've spent more time updating than playing this game I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone the paying players bully the none paying to the point there's a handful left the developer doesn't want to make a good game just money pitty it had potential,1
"Hello. It is a very good game. It was my only hobby. But he has not entered the game since half an hour ago. While I was in the game an hour ago. The system says your login is disabled. I tried for the overall game. I am very interested in the game, but the game does not allow me to enter",5
"Its not showing the exact details of increased might of today's quest, i upgraded tribe hall to level 17 and got 30000 might and upgraded walls to level 19 and got 150000 might and trained some of my troops for mobile tribulation event and got 71000 but its showing only 171000 for today's might, they took off 80k might how i should play it again I'm going to uninstall it",1
"Unplayable. I can't even login! Each time, I wait for a few seconds and then it says ""Login expired.""",1
"I enjoy the game as itself. The whole Vikings pov is the best part, the game play is to my liking and learning w the tutorial made things easier to understand the realm I'll be playing on.",4
I started playing this game from today and I have reached the city hall level 6 but I can't able to complete chapter 12 [at specific I can't able to Hire Machinery from Machinery Guild] because of that I stuck in Chapter 12 if anyone knows how to solve that issue pls tell me or I need to uninstall this game and move on,2
"At first i gived this game 4*. For few months i enjoyed playing the game. But, this game does not matter how good are you. If dont put serious amount of money u cant do anything. Sadly there are players who do that. It is irelevant how much resources u colect. Paying players gather only 50% of those i do, but they are 20 times stronger, to the point where they are untouchable and become game bully. So if u dont plan to invest 2000$ per month, dont even start it.",1
Game isn't bad saying that I've not been playing long obtaining decent hero's is a pain as summoning stones are not as abundant as other games of this type unless you buy them and there's plenty to tempt you to spend but there's not much in the way of free gifts to attract more people to play developers should think on this,4
"Why not just make your ad show EXACTLY WHAT THE GAME IS LIKE? WHY MUST EVERYONE PLAY ADS FOR A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GAME? might be a decent game, but I'm 1 ⭐ voting and uninstalling because of the false advertising. THE GAME IS NOTHING LIKE THE AD!",1
Best RTS game but the game becomes very hard after chapter 27. Few tasks are there which will take more than a month to complete.,5
"I have played these type of games before and i never really liked any of them until now, because I don't just like this game... I Love it. True Story. Thanks to the makers. My only wish would be that I wasn't so poor so I can actually purchase things from this game.",5
"Same pattern as various other buildup games, Zombie-war or similar. If u like that, this one has esp. refined graphics.",4
"Love all the ability increase wealth in game, but lots of opportunities to use money. The game play is beautiful and voice acting is on par. Free-miume game but kind worth it",4
"I like it, but twice already I started the game stopped and when I come back I start back at the beginning with everything erased even with logging into my Google account, uninstalling.",1
Fun game enjoying it with building troops and buildings with upgrades very addictive and enjoyable also. Having fun with also fighting and training your troops and more.,5
"Great game until you are open for PvP attacks. Having a player with 3.5 million might attack me repeatedly while I have 75,000 might and burning 4 days worth of game play resources each time has stonewalled my chance for development. No longer playing it.",2
"REALLY ENJOYABLE. Gently paced game. Love the Viking Norse based visuals, although the American accents were a little jarring and unexpected given the theme.",5
"Every time i start playing the game i loose all progress made, can't advance more than a days game. Also impossível to login with any account so back to the beginning.",1
"aso your latest update has really slowed the game, it's taking more battery and the resource gathering speed has slowed down by at least 50% we are uninstalling the game is not interesting anymore. You are being greedy.",1
"It was not at all as advertised. It's a base building game, but the ad showed it in a better light than the typical multiplet PvE city builder game.",1
"Yes, you got a winner. This game is definitely on my hot list for sure. I could play this game for 8 hours straight if my battery stayed charged",5
Been playing for few days.... I think that the bulidings should be made differently as they all look the same and also there is a little lag while playing. Rest it's great timepass,4
"It's funa and all but there are paywalls you reach, and not only that but a 35,000,000 power player can sit there and farm you( I was at 200,000) and all the resources you spent money on and you can't do anything at all to stop it. I wish they would fix it so people who just want to bully and raid low people get banned on god. It's not fair at all and if it's not fixed me and my friends are definitely switching to a different game🤷🏼‍♂️😂😂",3
From what I've played so far it seems pretty good. No annoying ads every jem purchase so that's a definite plus.,5
"A decent game, it has very similar vibes to other city builder games such as call of dragons, with the ""summoning"" and ""build speedups"", althought I never had a good experience with these games as they are pay to win.",3
Great game for your Mistplay units/gems. Very fun and interesting game play and story line. If you need paypal cash through Mistplay this game currently has the faster rewards. Also great promo code rewards. Just download this game if you like cash and vikings lol,5
"Don't play this awful game, it's nothing but a trap to force you to watch ads so the dev team can get a little more revenue. The gameplay is boring and derivative and not worth the ad spam",1
"This is a very good and entertainment game. I had so many fun with this game . And i love so much these type of viking games, And i can say that this very good nice game , But there is some issues when a update came game is not working properly . This is the only issue of this game as i can see, Otherwise this is a very good game",5
Developers ABSOLUTELY SCREWED THE GAME TOTALLY... Brand New update and took away MULTIPLE BUFFS update including these things were NOT ANNOUNCED nor were enough put in to have more than 3 big clans Running a Server... We HAD 10 working for us until this Update destroyed Several buffs without warning.,1
"interface is so complicated, screen is full with text, no visible difference when upgraded to higherlevel.",2
"Not at all like the add, uninstalling. Gave it a chance. Also not really playable on a phone screen.",1
"Terrible developer... I had fraudulent purchases made on my account, Devs refused to refund and when Google refunded it instead the Devs held my account ransom telling me I had to pay back the fraudulent charges, effectively scamming me. Don't waste your time with them.",1
It is very awesome very fun it has features like leveling up your heros and get troops there are monster where you can fight and has enemies.,5
I've only just started playing but I like the graphics and function. We'll see what the players are liking this game as I progress.,4
"Fun game if you ignore the fact, you have to restart the app every 20-30 minutes due to lagging and unresponsiveness. Probably should look into that sooner than later.",3
"Suddenly stopped. And back at start, what happened. I enjoyed the game but having to start over again made me delete it.",1
I'd like the ability to click on individual workers and troops rather than clicking on commands or resources. Overaall a really good game though!,4
"Early days but yes, not bad. Learning curve is steep, but achievable if you listen and stick at it.",4
The dialog is amazing and the graphics are outstanding along with so many different heroes to obtain.,5
"Amazing. It's slightly laggy at first, but get sooo but better! I've only JUST downloaded it but I love it. Can't wait to explore the rest of the game!",4
It was awesome feeling... I always like strategy games as i m fond of age of empires one of the most remarkable game and while palying Viking rise i was feeling awesome..and i love Vikings .. hope to see more of it,5
"This is, by far, the best game I have played in a long while. There should, however, be a menu option on the main screen to hide in game purchases. Not everyone wants to see them!",5
"I love the game, no ads, no money required, everything is earn while playing. This is how games are ought to be. Thank you, good job 👍",5
I will literally never put money into mobile games so it would be nice if the timing on stuff could go down. Waiting hours for something to get you to buy stuff is crazy.,4
The graphics we're great and the tutorial is very easy to learn and U can also communicate With People's And They are so nice👍 I recommend to play it But It have 1 Problems And it's the storage The MB is so High I almost can't download it I Prefer To low it down So More People Can download And play to see this amazing game I rlly Like it all Expect For storage So yeah😁,4
"One of the best game I have played, very interesting and enjoyable, but some lag issues should be improved, and world chat should be removed it makes game so much laggy. over-all good game",5
This game is awesome the graphics are good the game play is smooth. I just started playing. So far it's one of the best ones I played.In my opinion IGG is one of the best developers in strategy games,5
This is just another skin of a common build and battle template. Lame how no one can come up with innovative idea anymore just change the art and call it new. Deleted,1
"free to play friendly, amazing graphics, art, story. you can tell there is much kove put into this game unlike its competition",5
It's a good game. It needs to be optimised because it keeps closing down even on the lowest graphics settings.,4
Why I can't type in the main chat ? Can't see the message .😡🤬 Best of the best game . Highly recommended 👍👍👍👍👍very interesting . U must have a reliable high internet speed . 😜,5
"Works fine, not too complicated, text a bit small for mobile phone. Will keep enjoying this.",4
Too many issues loading and way to slow and freezing issues and just totally trash don't waste your time playing.,1
"This game is good but it lags in between and suddenly stops and after sometime it closes. Please, fix this bug....",1
"I'm enjoying it ,""hint "" I'm.a very seasoned mmo player, im not a cash player not even 1p or cent, im a totally F2P PLAYER, so.i get massive kudos when I achieve goals some pay for ,ill be getting on now . Otokar ,makes a valid point no need to double up research etc just 1 of each type of building is the norm except barracks hospital s rss tiles , I am returning to VR ,Michael watkins to play with friends might I suggest Evil Lands ;))JAAKARRH. Devs take players advice seriously, act on it .",5
"Very well done with graphics and info , though my eyes really have to strain. It would be nice if the font could be bigger?",5
I actually like this game surprisingly the wonderful game to play in your free time the graphics are amazing and there's a lot of different for bosses to fight,5
The game experience is so marvelous please make more developed in designs and game play by adding joysticks and graphics on natural circumstances.,4
Simple enjoyable building and battle,5
In your first play it's good the graphics is good and the game but when you are in the middle of the game so much lag bruh fix this.,2
Best game no bug no problem and adickting best game of the year 10/10000,5
Love it. it's really easy but kinda hard. You have to use strategies to eliminate the enemy,5
I only planned to try it out too see if I wanted to keep it on my phone or toss it ... I'm obviously keeping it because now I'm stuck addicted too it 😂 so very fun game to say the least .. ty Developers,5
"The graphics and game play were great, exactly what I was looking for. But the near constant buffering made me abandon the game. I tried changing my settings, wifi or mobile data, nothing seemed to improve the spinning wheel of boredom. If this ever gets fixed, I'll play again. But not before.",1
The flag on the opening screen annoys me. The hole changes sides when it shouldn't. Otherwise a good game,4
"it a very nice game, simple and nice graphics would recommend to a friend to play it. I haven't interact with any problem so it a good game for me.",5
The progress of the game is too fast. Not enough time for f2p players to develop. The game is not f2p friendly at all. The players that are on the top are always whale users,2
Its adventurous and exciting games towards great dynasty from before ages...,5
"Pretty good, but stop making the ads FAKE",3
"first time playing. Its actually good even though i hate having to follow commands,this kind of game. When the first fight come it will open an option where you can choose the commander. No matter how many times i open and close the app when it come to this part it just stuck there. Tried clicking everywhere in the screen and its still stuck. You can see where you click so you know you are stuck",3
"The game feels like P2W as we progress further. No other way to collect resources except collecting it from random spots or by unlocking new area. Also resources do not spawn much and hence leads to shortage. We need more resources as it is used almost in everything such as upgrading buildings, walls, watch tower, researches, training troops etc. And these requires tons of resources which is impossible to get through collecting it from random spots. Also, I lost my progress 2 times.",3
Very nice game can we improve the graphics to be like a real 3d game,4
Its a really great game but something is missing the profile u cant edit the profile and can't edit your own pictures and album hopefully in the future you can edit your own profile picture,3
Incredible game I first thought the IGG scammed people with the ads but no it's a great game. One thing is optimize this game for low end devices too like clash of clans and there should be an option to remove the chat and the translator in the chat is very bad. You improve all these this will be the best game.,5
"Fun to explore and vast features, but I want to be able to relocate to my friends kingdom, please make relocation among kingdom possible.",3
"Good graphics, hard to learn.",4
"Really ? Are you serious ? as long as I reach th 5, I got attacked from bigger player, without any shield or anything for new playee, really man... disappointed... un-installed",1
The game is intuitive instructions are easy to understand right off the bat you can do a lot they dont upgrade block you.,5
This has to be the closest I played age of empires and a longtime good graphics is it a follow the gameplay decent story and they're not trying to nickel-and-dime you to progress,5
Very interesting game! Wish it had more characters though.,4
"Love the game not boring, can play straight 3 hrs no problem",5
I've been having a great time. Constant action and challenging challenging beasts to defeat.,5
"Surprisingly few ads. Nothing like the ads shown for the game, but it's alright. Definitely not the worst timewaster",4
I like the game and graphics but it stalls alot.,3
"Game is great but huge frame drop is experienced even at the low graphics it still lags bad, constant updating aswell.",4
After the maintenance so much lag and glitch i wech you fixed the problem faster,1
"Way too much like lords mobile, many popups and complex",2
"Great game but you get to a point to grow faster in the game you need to buy more food,wood,stone using a credit card!!!",1
"Issues Downloading So initially it said my phone had no available space. Once I removed many apps, and tried again. It went thru the download process to 100% but when it went to install it said error accured. Im not sure whats going on. Very disappointed.",1
I don't want to review this game as zero but . Whenever I try to open this game it says network error though I have a good wifi signal . Yet not experienced but still giving you 5stars.,5
Super game.good vision and beautiful graphics,5
"Its ok so far, there's a lot i'm not sure how to do yet.. Update... 34 days in and this is a great game! Love it!",5
Game is fun in its self and there are some good players but too many a-hole players ruin the game. Better hope those players continue to pay since others like me will just quit playing.,1
"It is a really fun and great game with a good story and graphic with many goods voice line is perfect,The characters are awesome",5
One of the most addictive games I've ever played...the gameplay graphics is just outstanding and there is no no while playing.. it's a good tactical game,5
This game always fun I really appreciate it let's all download this game and some fun 😁.,5
It's very good. Ether tho it's not like in the ads but still it's a very good game I recommend you downloading it. And the graphics is just so good,4
"It's an ok castle builder, I found the wait times ridiculously long which is probably fine for the ptw's out there. But as a sensible ftp it's just not worth the wait.",3
Game graphics and concept is good game is smoothly I like this game,5
I think it is it is a really relaxing game and help you with thinking,5
Only just started but so far it is fun and exactly as advertised,5
I love how you can expand the teratory and you can upgrade you builds to a high copacity. This might be the most fun and strgiest game i have ever played.,5
By far its basic and time equivalent with multitasking,4
Fun game. Just that none of your progress saves even if u create an account. I do not advise playing unless u like restarting your progress,1
"Avoid this game if you just want to enjoy it,only 3 zones,full of bullying high ranking tribes.you can't just enjoy it,smaller tribes get forced into leaving,disbanding by the top 3,which is wrong.hopefully this game gets removed,never known anything like it.",1
"Nice game actually, but there is too many toxic players in the game that always constantly attacking your resource collectors and drains your resources until you dont have anything. Its time to quit this game...",5
"buggies release versions of a builder I have yet encountered. Server power is also weak,requiring constant reboots to restore cache limits just to have any chance of playability. I AM ON A 16 GIG RAM ANDROID TABLET. No way this app should be hanging at any point but it does. The pros of this are slim but it has some good graphics effects with the heroes skills in battle. That is about it. Rewards drops are pitifully small for lvl of difficulty,research times impossibly long for the low levels.",1
"Great graphics and it's cool that you can move the house not like any others that just place it on their. own I like sandbox and this is the Greatest one yet so far, over all 10/10",5
"Awesome game! Haven't stopped playing it, smooth graphics and game play, easy to learn and follow. Very addictive!",5
Good theme and very creative gameplay,5
Love this game. Game only 2 months old too so we in on the beginning. The opportunity to be a founding player... a potential whale... gotta take it.,5
0 ads and lots of gameplay! You can get incredibly strong in less than an hour. Always has more for you to play!,5
This game is amazing and bad too bad because in it ad it look we will tame all these monsters and attack other monsters but in the game and good because it is medium not too bad not too good 👍👍 it is purfect because we attack other animals and monsters and help other peoples,5
It was doing good now I can't get into my game it froze on my screen that says checking for on resources and it won't go any further please fix this so I can play my game,1
Won't move around. I can get to hunt and forage but can't move the screen or ppl. In the first screen.,1
"Actually quite decent of a game, was really surprised, lots to do and actually has voices for all characters. Great experience!",5
It's funny just kind of like the ads,5
Really cool game. It's like Clash of Clans mixed with Assassins Creed Valhalla.,5
Tutorial is best thing for this game. I'm learning so much from it.,5
Pretty fine game! Where the ads are actually telling the truth. Although it takes more time and patience later in the game,5
It's a fun base builder style game with a viking flavor,5
Once you reach the point of clans lots of visual clutter appears on screen but other than that it seems good,4
Really like the story it's nice and the gameplay is nice too,5
"A little bit ""sticky"" at times, have to come out and reload. Otherwise really good so far.",4
This game is very interesting and not boring the graphics is absolutely good and the sound is realistic.,5
It was good but my only problem is that when I fight something it will lag and make me leave the game I don't know if it's the phone or what is making that happen but over all it's a nice game.,4
Easy to play never ending staff to do easy guide,5
This game isn't awesome game? I'll let you build your own Viking settlement and rescue people. It really gives you taste to have vikings were back in a day,5
I enjoyed the game since I have just completed the Vikings season movie😉,5
"Nice game. Could add a little bit color to the environment. Please fix the chat, we can't copy the Discord link when pasted on chat.",4
Have been playing this game for a while and enjoy it. Can't log on today as it needs upgrading which it won't allow me to do. So tried uninstalling and then install which it won't do either. Not the first time this has happened. Obvious server problems. Suggest you find different game that runs smoothly. This one sucks.,1
So far not really good... Offering premium currency for a rating will give a rating. Bet a real one? Doubtfull!,3
"I am still early in the game , but I am looking forward to seeing what happens as I progress, great game so far",4
I am really enjoying this game. The beginning gives you enough guidance without feeling like it's holding your hand the entire time.,5
Getting tired of the 2 really high tribes starting fights just so they can steal all your progress,2
"This game is so addictive and fun! I'm obsessed with it! I have a great tribe and I'm so ahead thanks to the cheap packs! This is my favourite game, and I'd never stop playing it! I'd recommend it to all my friends!",5
"Enjoying it for the most part, but wanna know why my game is crashing when I use Bronze Bells, then I lose the bell? Now it's just gone, and I get no rally or rewards...",3
"Everything thing is ok but you can not play with your friend, because they don't give permission to transfer freely in any Kingdom ,you can't not goin the tribe if it's is not in your Kingdom,or it can can not help in creating a clan area, if you want to play alon than it good",2
"I enjoyed the movie and when I saw the game, I knew instantly what was my objective.",5
I love this game! The fact that you get to explore the area and harvest items and retrieve lost items is awesome,5
It's good for timepass and the map is big i thought i will be a 1$ gameplay and graphics but i was wrong it's 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000$ gameplay and graphics,5
"It's like all other games of that genre, after a while it's repeating the quests and it's only fighting. For me very boring. They don't provide the possibility to delete the account and city. Not enyoiable. There is nothing to talk about, I just want to be delete my account and city, that's all. You as the developer should be able to install the possibility of deleting.",1
"Still early in my experience, but very fun thus far. No lagging for me, but I don't have a crappel. Giving 5 stars as can't put phone down atm.",5
"Graphics is good like PC games, most important is no advertising and no need top up money. Just play as it is.",5
This game is fun in so many ways a narrative that sets the pace for action crafting and many more awesome features including heros of legend not just made up lore epic game to say the least for sure. 🔥,5
Mount feature is not available..you can't build monster pen,1
Great game I like meeting new people from around the world and this is where you can do that. Growing your tribe and building your army. Fighting monsters.,5
Please make heal free so we can fight without fear of healing since it costs alot of resources and please put a button for hiding id number it will be better for more user privancy,4
quick action game just fowwow the golden arrows to gain level required items and mission steps to advance on don't forget to train and recruit more members in your pack so yo can avoid defeats.,4
"starts to take a days for everything by lvl 15 and week+ after 20, p2w heavy with mostly empty servers after 2 weeks, hurry up and wait. With auto battle. Good if you just want to waste time",2
Wicked good to fill in time fun and interesting to play,4
When I downloaded Viking Rise and I played it? I absolutely loved it! The graphics everything! It's such an amazing game keep up the good work!,4
"Like game so far,don't like restriction on cutting trees",5
Very good graphics and enjoyed playing the game,5
Game is running smoothly good graphics,4
"Standard tutorial, which allow u to tap only in 1 spot, u cant skip it, u cant play untill u finish it, i have no patience for that",1
not exactly how the video showed it but it's alright,4
"Really fun, reminds me of old starcraft type games. Only 4 stars because of the need to buy in game currency to lower buff times.",4
Im from server 7... and wow where do I start... the king there is abusive... uses threatening manner to the entire server! Hes uses racial words frequently... basically uses bullying tactics to ruin everyone's game... been playing since server 7 opened and I did enjoy my time... but hes made everyone's life hell and being a paying customer to the game its put me right off playing... :(,1
"As, new member I can only give my assessment after playing for couple of days, as of now I'm enjoying😊 the game now.",4
"Best game of war yet. Not pay to win, hope it stays that way. The Devs are active in keeping the game updated.",5
It's just as good as I thought it might be and the different things to collect.Ahhhh.Best topveiw and action-adventure game ever!!!,5
Great games and graphics ..With strong alliance.. love it so much.. going to play this games all time.. Keep it up developers. Support you all guys. 😇🥰,5
Good graphics and art style.,5
Ok update it's gotta way better than expected except for some things shouldn't cost money to keep going other than it's awesome rockin amazing wonderful game setup s oh keep it simple please with future adds so playing is fair and fun,5
It's a typical builder game but this one isn't a grind like most others. The gameplay is smooth and progresses nicely.,4
"Nice game, good graphics, but only thing that bothers me that the area cant be developed much into a big empire.. 👍",4
Game is so good about stratigis and Statics are also so good I love this game so much and my opinion other have to play viking rise,5
"Great graphics though hard to see on a phone screen. A fairly complex game with lots of angles to attack and build, but I didn't find clear instructions to many pieces of this puzzle.",4
Still early stages. Enjoying the story line so far but will probably growing one of those pay to win strategy games later on.,4
After updating so many times I can't get access to beast pen and it is so frustrating . Please bring it fastly,1
"good game good graphics, you can work while playing",5
This game is the second best adventure game I've ever played but one thing is in one way is that in this game you can build your adventure so in that it would be the best adventure game ever,5
I have never seen a game like this I was just seeing playstore for making use of my leftover data . This game is super amazing It needs wify but you can use VPN too,5
"Nice game, I like the building and upgrading heros. 😄",4
Good game i would recommend it One of my friends told me to play it and I cannot stop playing lol,5
Yeah iv played this kind of game a thousand times but I'm enjoying myself. Expecially when I blocked the notifications. It's a good time waster.,5
Smooth graphics. Easy to learn and just great fun without too much waiting around,5
I love this game. it is very interesting and graphics are also good,4
everything's fantastic other than for some reason it'll give you a recommended troop number to do a fight but even if you have 4 to 5 hundred above what it recommends you'll still lose...,4
"Great job on the game, all it needs is more heroes, I keep coming back to the game. Awesome job guys and girls.",5
"Fun, and the visuals are good.",5
"brilliant set with different season aswell so realistic 10,000,000 out 10",5
Game is a lot of fun good upgrades challenges over fun,5
"I've been looking forward to this game coming out! Other viking games I've played were disappointing: Viking Rise doesn't disappoint! It's fun and addictive. The UI, graphics, character, scenery, artwork, are pleasant, along with, shortly done storylines. Con: a lot of buffering, but it’s expected being new. Suggestion: separate the hero, exp, etc, in the recruitment. Wanting a hero and receiving exp can be frustrating for the player. Also, allow upgrading troop buildings while training troops",5
"Well designed. Slow interface, responds after few seconds of touch operation.",4
"Actually, after playing almost multiple times. It's meah, nothing special 😩 It is hard to play , and it's a nice graphic👌",2
"In a general view, I can say that the wonderful graphics and different style with different items really make the game interesting",5
I always enjoy playing building and strategy games. This is different from games like SimCity but ancient times is where I want to live,5
"Best but not better, need high resolution graphics",4
"Love it! It's right up my alley with gaming and type of game style along with the fact I'm an Odinist. So it's part of my Tru. Good game, haven't really had to buy anything yet, so far so good..Hail!",5
it's a fun game... I'm only rating for the jems... but it's a fun game to pass the time,5
Great game lots to do and fight you way forward,4
I love this game so much it has no adds and is really both interesting and awesome 👍😎 this game has my approval 😸😁,5
"Still giving you a 1 star. Pay 2 win game, some people in game can sell resources. Not a competitive game. There's a rumor cheater and hackers. Just need developers to check it out. Please look for the issue., not just for profits.",1
Great game.. Felt like i am playing a modern age of mythology.. Just started playing so can't say much as I'm still trying to figure out game dynamics.,4
Slow to start but consuming in strategy and .,4
"Nice game actually, but there's two things bothering me. First, the game is too laggy like when I just try to press something,building structures, summoning heroes, and more, it randomly lags so bad that it kicks me out of the game. Second, so many bugs! Like after I fight with some enemies and try to claim my reward, it randomly restarts or I have to restart it on purpose because I can't press claim until I restart it again, but overall it's a nice game! Hope it's useful...",3
"The graphics are nice but it's the same kind of build and battle where you have to level up your soldiers, acquire heroes, look for resources, upgrade and train and research. It's very very slow moving however I've been playing it now for a couple of weeks and I've only upgraded to the second level of soldiers. You really can't improve in this game unless you pay money",1
It a good game but it takes a while if you don't have speed ups,4
"There's no doubt a great game. After I playd the game about one month, I enjoyed it very well. However there is too much lag in this game. Everytime I play it exit itself I have to log in again and about 8-10 minutes it exit again 😒. To add on, I uninstall the game becse my city was count attackd and all resources wer gone. I understand there are too many ways to protect it but the fact the shield cost too much gems and I didn't unlock laird whose good at count attack I was really left fuming.",3
"I've had to restart every single time I log into the app. I have tried searching for ways of saving the game, but each time it starts me at the beginning. Even when I tried linking my accounts to ensure my progress was saved. If someone could tell me how to save, I'd give it an actual shot",2
"Good graphics, one of the best in the genre on mobile. But, that's about it. The controls are clunky, you need to press buttons repeatedly. Lag issues are also rampant. Apart from that, what irked me the most was how stingy the game/developers is/are with respect to resources and items provided (especially early game). Being a new game it seems counterintuitive to be THAT stingy if your goal is to make more people play it. I'm leaving the game for good, there are lots of more generous F2P games",1
Just another boring copy/pasted war builder. Nothing different about this than any of the thousands of other games exactly the same. Not to mention the constant connection issues and lag performing even the most basic of functions. Utter waste of time.,1
"I would definitely not recommend this game to anyone. Why? The servers are essentially dead. A lot of the long term players with 5,000,000+ power are toxic and prey on the new players rather than fighting someone closer to their might. An example being, I have 750,000 might, 2 players, both with more than 5 times my might attacked me a total of 68 times effectively depleting all the resources I had collected (there is no passive gains for resources) I'd write more but character limits",1
"Early but was really enjoying the game. Good progress initially. Then you hit a brick wall, especially if you've been attacked. Takes ages to rebuild your army. Shields seem few and far between and very expensive.",4
"Gfx and Game are very good. HOWEVER, If you are not willing to spend a lot of money on this game (you can but you will loose to someone with deeper pockets), and a lot if time (things happen during the times you are offline, including attacks on you, likely a super strong player that spends a lot of money on this), this games is not for you. Have you ever played ""Stormfall"", a flash game some 12 years ago? This is basically it, dressed in a Viking theme. Improved, though.",1
"Amazing graphics and beginning of the game, is interesting. But afterwards it gets very boring, monotonous, and just like every similar game. I was looking for an ORIGINAL, not the same concept of their other games. Which I have played and did NOT enjoy. I'm playing a better game, so I won't be coming back to Viking Rise. Tried it, was impressed, but not for long. Goodbye!",1
"The experince WAS fun. Now it is just draining. I love being busy with life only to be attacked multiple times. Then because it has the awful gameplay mechanic of if you have been attacked, they take your resources. I had millions of materials only to come back the next day, from like 2 mil down to 300 thousand. If that is not a punch to the gut, idk what is.",2
"I really enjoyed this game and was looking forward to playing it regularly the way I do Clash of Clans, Dominations, and Rise Of Cultures. The graphics are great, and so is the game play. My issue, however, is that it keeps taking me back to the beginning of the game. I saw another review that says it does that when you've been invaded. I've had to start over so many times that I'm just not interested anymore. Sad because I can tell I would've had so much fun here.",1
The best game and best graphics of survival,5
"Nothing really stands out about the game. And the story line seems average. But there are no adds so far, so that's a bonus.",3
After one hour of playing it very good. Same concept as many games but different way of going about it.,4
Amazing story and realistic graphics,5
So far game play is easy and it's easy to obtain the necessary stock without having to purchase them to progress in the game,4
So far very good and very well made nice detail not like most free games,5
Love the game.love the graphics..awsome game...keep uo the good work..would love if you guys can make it so that a person can play offline also..wouod be great,5
"The typical build, raid, wait ""strategy"" game. But it's pretty good. I like the workers system.",4
"Great game, similar to other games in this genre but the optimisation is horrendous, I have to tap twice to complete any task. Very Slow progression where I have to wait and wait. No thank you.",3
Gotta say the builders speeding up the construction process is a refreshing take on this style game makes it a lot more fun and manageable to play,4
"The games is super fun to play, the grafics are so good and the story line is just great and upgrading your city is easy since you get speed up cards like ever second and it does not take a lot of battery life but the thing I hate the most is after a long period of time the games would start to lag so hard. It got to the point where my phone when on emergency mode and I had to restart my phone. The bad case scenario was if my phone had to reboot which did not happen tho",3
Still a lot to learn but the art is great.,4
Fun game good graphics have just started gameplay is good and haven't had any problems loading or freezing no lag seems to be put together well,4
"Was excellent until I found out it's multiplayer where you need to join alliances or clans. I'm done playing vs people, they always ruin my day.",4
At first since it was an ad I hated it but the gameplay was way better than the ad gameplay it's an amazing game for viking rise I just realised oversimplified sponsored it I love you and oversimplified,5
Super ! It's intresting and it's a good timepass,5
A thousand times better than the Lords mobile I really experience this game very good the graphics are very real and their some issues are but we should not avoid it birthday game developer mast update this game I have a wonderful experience,5
THE BEST GAME I HAD EVER PLAY AND SEEN ON PLAYSTOR HAVE TO FIX SOME BUG 1 . LAGGING ISSUE WHILE MOVING THE SCREEN,5
Just another slow and Boring game wanting you money. Don't waste your time watching grass grow is more exciting and entertaining than this pos.,1
"This game is good but less content, same just like Call of Dragons distroying each other towers, story mode is hard. So still Lords mobile Best",3
I love the storyline the animation and easy to understand. And it's reminders of isekai anime. Love this game.,4
Brilliant game. Excellent graphics,5
This can be a great game but it still needs some upgrdes in graphics and need to add some new guards Swords man etc,4
"Didnt work often of the time, so I needed to restart, ive also entered My Code for an Event called Arctic Warrior and sadly didnt recevie the promised rewards.",2
"So far it seems pretty good, easy to level up, hard battles. Good challenge",4
Great game just a little slow loading.,4
Very fun and unique. Awesome gameplay! Excellent game to just enjoy yourself while passing a little time.,5
"Was having fun with the game, however now it crashes during the loading screen and shuts down the app. Shame because i was really enjoying this",1
Keep getting lag issues so it's not a smooth transition and now I'm getting login id issues but I do see potential in this game.,2
"Just started play, it's great so far, easy to learn, great game play, it keep me busy an involved, thanks for the awesome game keep it up guys, THANKS AGAIN",5
It's a good game no coruupt no lag no glitch but I gave it a 4 star rating bcuz the waiting when upgrading or building is way too long. GOOD GAME,4
"This game is awesome and good job , it's just like clash of clan but more realistic and more spaces good job keep it up.",5
Haven't played much but I can say this is the most fun type of this game I've personally played!,5
"Powerful game, at first sight looks boring but a few minutes in, the game is extremely beautiful.",5
It's very relaxing and entertaining. I haven't found any issues yet. That's why I'm rating it 4 out of 5 because I'm sure there will be some issues. Keep up the good work and I'm sure this will be a really great game.,4
"This game is fun and addictive. Cool story line and very easy to follow. Lots to do in this game so, you're kept entertained.",5
Nice game but needs serious upgrade on the graphics and fighting scenes. The story line is interesting,3
Really good game totally engaged in it. However I wish it didn't take so long to upgrade and build stuff,4
Good story flow and character presentation,5
Awesome graphics so far no problems detected,5
"Good intro, great graphics and the story is well written, no nasty surprises so far, still fun after a while",5
"Ohh ya pretty much good game. But need some additional effect and seen of wars. Like a big army Coming with elephants and ships,etc.",4
Great tutorial so if new to game load and play it's pretty neat,5
It's giving the ages of empire vibes but need to get a proper hang of it,4
Fun to play graphics are nice.,5
"Was on mistplay and then it wasn't or at least I couldn't find it on there anymore. So, I decided to play it by downloading it on its own. I'd like to give 5 stars but I can't find it on mistplay.",4
"An enjoyable gameapp, which gives you plenty to think of as you update all buildings and I wish I had started playing from the onset.",5
Please add a option to autotranslate the messages in the tribe chat It is so hard to translate the messages one by one,4
Giving it 3 stars for now because still not understanding on how to join other teams been playing for a few days now,3
Please fix the chat in the game. Not appearing well.,3
Love this game! It's probably the best I've seen in this genre. The graphics are awesome. Advancing is easy. Feels authentic.,5
"It graphic is high and I love this game ,no laig no ping thanks",5
"Pay to win no skill needed just money, no way to hold balance in game and even if you pay on one character if you make alt your ftp on that one.",4
Very exciting and interesting game if you love strategy games like me. Development is slow but worthwhile! Thanks team!,5
Stated and was very pleased. Until it started to freeze up on me and I would lose patience and exit,1
"Seems fun at first, but then the lag hits around literally every corner. Doesn't matter how excellent your connection is, how clean or how new your phone. They don't fix the issue in any update even when it's been made aware on the game & in their official discord. Also every single Ad for the game is a lie, so whenever you see in an Ad for the game & think ""oh that's cool"" just know that the features you see don't exist. I despise liars especially lying developers, so enjoy the 1 star rating!",1
Ur game is very slow...i thot it was my phone but its not its coz of the game whenever i build or cut trees there is always a buffering...please check it.,1
"Buggy and power hunger, can easily drain handset battery power but quite addictive and great graphics.",3
"Love it. Very addictive, amazing graphics",5
The graphics are so realistic and awesome and playing it I feel like I am in the viking era.Overall it's very good.,4
I like the game very much but I dunno if it's pay2win.. but I did not get any ads and proposition yet I think that's a good sign 🤘,5
Just started pretty good so far but the resource rewards and speed ups could be better makes it hard to grow when you first start,4
Best game In Android History andgood voice actors what a game,5
this is a great game but the reason it got four star is because the music keeps lagging and glitches all the time but is still a good game for me,4
Really nice graphics but finding it a bit hard to defeat the enemies.,5
The game is great but i suggest that you should lower the cost of upgrading heroes because it's hard to obtain the upgrading materials same on skill upgrade,4
"Excellent, new device and game running a dream 😁",5
Its awesome it is indicates on how you do your strategy and build your civilisation,4
I absolutely love it No ads and great graphics,5
"good concept , aweaome game ,but its not updating for me , threres plenty space on my mobile and the network is also good . i hope it updates soon . i really love this game , it will be a shame if i have to uninstall it,. thank u devs. cheers from India.",5
"The game is extremely promising. A very good introduction towards it's gameplay. Quality effects and Sound Design. I'd also compliment the voice acting for the characters/heroes/legends you can obtain. It's also quite unique with no resource generating buildings (recently started an hour ago, might change/apply) which is quite quirky. Nevertheless, I did waited for this game to be available and I can say this game is promising. I'm excited to see the rest of the features as a beginner.",4
It's a pretty goof game at least in the beggining. It's sometimes a little confusing but otherwise just fun,4
This game is designed to force the user to pay money for stones. Otherwise you will be stuck at level 40 forever,1
Fun with good graphics,5
"I have only been playing for a day now and so dar i like the game,graphics its a good game",4
This game is sooo GOOOD bro I love it I want to play this game for years and no adds this is the world's best game EVEEEEEERRRR!!!😃😃😃😃🥰😍🥰😍,5
"A very good game easy to play, really like the game",4
Seems a bit more developed then the other similar games,4
"It's alright I guess, could be much better though for real",3
"Great campaign, can pause at times, love the base building and strategy.",4
Nice Graphic is not bad at all,4
I have spend 100 days in this game. After i realised that this game is pay 2 win.The person spending more money is way more stronger than you.No matter how much effort you put in the game. Even some characters in game is not free too.The better characters are to be buy.This is a strategy game and it has too much low resources on gathering as compared to other games.Also you can't freely change your server too. That is too much frastating. Two star just for it's better graphics.,2
"Super Game! It's a Enjoying Game where you can be come a King, And the fighter at the same time ! where you can Comand everything.",5
Great game to play its just fine the way it is now and I love it its really cool.,5
I'm really enjoying the spiking adventure right now everything seems to be when working order working very nice good graphics good sound everything about it is pretty nice,4
It is cool when you build base kill monsters collect heroes or RSS and repair ways to get farther away n different places,5
Fun but same old drawn out game,2
Good game so far. Love the story line.,4
keeps shuting down while playing. i gave up and uninstalled it,2
Very fun game not party to win. You can play for hours before you ruin it off things to do and need to wait for resources,5
"The text or letters is terribly tiny read I keep getting headaches everytime i read longer, the loading is terrible....",1
"This is a fabulously fun game if played the way it is supposed to be played. Sign up expecting a Care Bear like experience & you will suffer the consequences. Be bold, be aggressive & you will enjoy the game immensely.",5
"Terrible lag, the notification doesn't open the game, the game isn't clear on how to collect resources (no its not just tab the tree for wood, tab the shrub for food... there is more to it and the game doesn't make it clear). The buildings stops displaying their levels when you move the screen... I can keep on naming stuff the game can improve on, but it isn't worth anymore since I won't be playing the game.",1
Awesome at first then it becomes really boring after 4 months I Uninstaller game,5
"A very enjoyable game! Challenging, but easy to learn and progress, I am loving it!!",5
"Great game, icons could be clearer to understand",4
Game is good but too much lag and auto off make me disappointed so that's the only reason so plz developer do some work on it everytime i chat in group it crash and off,1
Brilliant game. Great time consumer. Constantly invigorates interest by fresh ideas and tasks. Would highly recommend,5
"Really great game and concept, great story and lots to do. But the big problem at the moment is the performance issue whenever you go from the big map back to your city even on low settings it freezes and hangs. The game sometimes crashes. Maybe the developers could look into stabilising issues. But when I can, it is a great game to play just I would pay it longer but the freeze frames and excessive lag do wind me up.",4
Waste of time do not play this game. Played for 2 months to build troops to defeat the main boss and opened my game and all my troops had been destroyed. No warning this could happen. Contacted support and they said that's part of the game and to rebuild them which would take another 2 months. Disgusting!!! 2 months wasted. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS JOKE OF A GAME,1
"Game is great, I would appreciate more if there could be manually fighting control, but cheers for strategic depth",4
Experience has been fantastic all along .. But I got a problem logging in at the moment.. I can't seem to logging with my mobile network? Why all this?,4
Nice and enjoying graphic is too good. I love to play this game new and fresh it's so solid adventures and full of sound music and masti,5
Too slow sometimes and freeze up alot,4
"A decent strategy game if you are looking for one , some aspects could be better but overall it's a decent play",4
"Graphics are really awesome, but somehow I don't really enjoy it.. Maybe make it more smooth?",4
I've always played clash of clans but this is a 10/10 all the way,5
"Unplayable, keep freezing and reloading",1
Good game major problem is the resource to collect to go forward pay to go forward or wait for days to upgrade the things if this things get solve then it's good game,1
Love everything about the game the graphics are amazing and even the way things are upgraded and leveling is amazing. An amazing game,5
"Just played the game, so I can't share any Errors, issues, or glitch in the game. Will edit this if I found something",4
It's a good game. I've been playing for a few hours and I've really enjoyed it.,5
"Nice interacting, and visually appealing",5
The concept is good.. Most of all the graphics are way good than any game with the same concept.,5
"Still learning, but it's a pretty good game so far. No noticeable glitches or other concerns.",4
I love this game Best thing is that about realistic graphics,5
"Im here solely to ask, why must your ad keep crashing my tv when I use certain apps? For this reason alone I refuse to even try the game",1
Enjoy both the build and battle aspects. A little new compared to other games I've played.,5
Its really a good game because I never played such a good game and please add some new heroes and locations. And overall its a good game.,5
"Enjoying the game but an a total newbie so trying to get the hang of it, so far so good. First strategic game that I am playing.👍",5
It's no fun when the shuts down abruptly while you playing. I solved the problem from my end.,2
"Great really good ,. Fun game to play . I really like Viking rise its GGGggrreat! .",5
It's a very amazing game i love it's graphic and game quality better than rhe ads it's story line and battels are very realistic.,5
Honestly I love it 0 ads you always have something to do and actual good troop designs however I feel like its not reaching its true potential overall good game,4
Awesomeness time consuming.i enjoy playing this game makes me feel I'm in different world. And that it keeps me busy and over form watching TV,5
Game in best but low processor is not working 😞😕,4
"Works great, good management game, nice graphics. Doesn't overclock a Pixel 4.",5
"Everytime I logged out, have to reset progress all over again. I started when it just come out. Maybe it's better now but so annoying even when I connected it to another app, same thing. Uninstalled afterwards, whats the point starting brand new everytime you logged in sigh 😔",1
The game is fun itself but what's making it enjoyable is when you can interact with other people from different countries.,5
"Very good game, not a direct copy paste from the build and train troops style game but follows the framework that everyone knows. 4 star because the UI is very hard to understand and get use to. Too many buttons and not enough labelling. You get plenty of free items just by doing story and levelling up. The discord also has codes you redeem for more prizes. I've gotten 6 level 20 heros and I didn't have to spend a cent. Very well done f2p market/shop",4
"This game is so good and lovely ,a players when understand this game, I think never left",4
Best mobile city builder I've played. Wish there were more hero features and gameplay options though.,5
the last major maintenance got my games lagging so often and then suddenly crash but overall the game was fun. just hate the last maintenance,2
Honestly one of the best games I've played so far. It's easy to manage and is exciting to see the settlement grow.,5
"I just started but having a fun while playing it, although it's till hard to gather resources because of area.",4
What a game literally super game with nice graphics best game of all time but there are some lags while I click on research button plz fix this nd keep it up,5
It's really fun and entertaining and you don't need to pay for Jack here.,4
I really like this game for the most part. Getting really money hungry now. Harvested 15m rss in 3 days and still can't upgrade buildings and research always asking do I want to buy a pack. I really don't mind buying packs but rss no not every day. Always running out of stamina can't buy a pack for that. Wish they did more packs with heros or new camps. Really close to deleting this game.,1
"I started the game then found out that it's yet one more dang alliance game. Sorry, I don't want to play with other people. Just looking for something that actually takes a bit of strategy. And yet, not have to worry about everyone else to carry out their end of the game. As far as what I did play. it's ok. A little bit more to it than just update this, upgrade that. But really not anything you actually have to think about. I wasn't constantly bombarded with ""buy this"" banners, which was a plus",3
"Graphics have some different layouts with similar concepts of other games I've played. Good game, still",4
Very unique game easy to learn and graphics are pr etty good. No issues yet. Knock on wood! Lol,5
"What an awesome game i have built a beautiful village, sadly I have lost a couple battles but other than that it is great 👍",5
Good story line and graphics,4
"Pretty good, zoom out needs a touchup",4
I like it so far even tho I haven't even completed the tutos! 😂,5
Hi this game is fun but it's more serious when the heroes talk and fight in a battle I'll give it an 6 out of 10 because............... idk it well sooo good ?!!!! ..... ....,4
It's time consuming and that's good for my focus,5
Excellent game with a lot of features.,5
Main problem is in the law of the jungle event. You rellay need to improve that.,4
"just started playing, So just 3 stars for now! I will update it soon .",3
Great game until your kingdom gets overrun by bot farms.,2
Great graphics smooth play,5
"Battles,Wars,Attacks, Recruiting,RankUps, this is it, GREAT GAME. AN ADVENTURE!!",5
very good graphics and story,5
"Adventurs at certain levl bt many time it's looks unfair that at any time tribe can leav and join another one this will lead powerful becom more powerful also in many missions u have take help from tribe members bt it's not compulory to them to help other that time mision couldn't be completed its unfair to depend on them there must another option to complete it,editor must distribut tribe membrs to anothr tribs who need them there must be random shuffle in tribe,plz distribut powr mak all equal",1
Great game not way to complicated for a newby like me.,5
Just got started and it's very fun 😊,5
Good and realistic game Having good time playing it,4
I m randomly downloaded this game and now there my favourite game || music and graphics is so upper level,5
Great game so far. We will see later in the game. Good job.,5
Easy to navigate,5
i like vikings but here i can not play multiplayer,4
Easy fun no ads,5
Fun game good way to waste time,4
Interactive and fun,5
fun to play and make friends,5
It's a quite good game love the new changes and it's just better now like it,4
A good time relaxing playing this game. Can't put it down,4
Pretty sweet so far I'm loving the village building and the combat,4
Very good graphics,5
Easy and fun Game,5
"GREAT Graphic , Thank You Norway Corporation For Viking Game ( Please Makes : Rain And Snow , Winter For Game )",5
"Fast, fun, and fabulous!",5
Enjoy and easy for beginners like me,5
Easy game to understand,5
Not enough action you have to build everything,2
The ossum game in the world a very nice game it's a very beautiful than lords mobile,5
"Take A Moment Relax and Enjoy the game. Stay Silly Stay Safe and stay free, Vikings",5
What is with the advertised video not at all like the game play,1
Fun game! Great to come and dire wolfs!,5
Very good game it very entertaining 10/10 👍👍🤟,5
For people who like strategy games and WAR! best game ever 😎,5
Game is good but it's totally pay to win,3
It's not bad just like the snow game I played but vikings this time,3
"One of the best building games I've ever played, Has all the best rewards you can salvage in the game",5
This game is very nice and graphics are also better,5
"the game is great but the only problem is it always lags, the lagging is killing me please fix the crash issues",2
"Played for a few days already. The game's actually much more enjoyable than I initially expected. Well-designed/voiced 3D characters with decently written lines add color to the 'mediocre' story. Game optimization is remarkable considering the unnoticeable heating and battery consumption under high refresh rate, which brings nice control and more immersive experience. I can happily follow the 'newbie flow' by simply accomplishing the tasks on the given list one by one. Keep up the good work! ;)",5
"Game just sucks. It's another Dominations game. I was Empire and Allies for 9 years before they shut down. they had player assist on upgrades, troop request, request for supplies, and I miss it. This game really sucks, and I don't have another 9yrs for a game that sucks.",1
"Same type of game, just different graphics and sound. A waste of time. Pay and you will win.",2
This game is fun intuitive an overall great entertainment I usually don't like games like this but this one hits a spot in my heart,5
Just started. Takes time but really fun so far.,5
It is very good but it can use some adjustment,5
I was on it for 3 months if not longer And I find it quite frustrating we're other components We're attacking you behind the scenes So you never got to collect the wood or the food Auto rebuild your Soldiers This happened 5 to 5 times So I think the game is a waste of time So I think the game is a waste of time There's far more better games out there than this one,2
"It was amazing at the begining and I spent about a mounth staight playing it but then I took a break from my phone for a couple weeks and today I started playing again and ALL my progress was gone, the whole months worth gone, hopfully they fix this because I nearly cried, if that didnt happen it would be a five star.",3
"It's fun but could use a lot of work on the graphics side, even if it means having a 500mb update.",3
Very easy and fun game to play,5
"Great graphics,needs a better zoom feature less gathering and more fighting.",4
"The best game ever, love the story line and how it is setup makes me think of every movie part at some point",5
"I really love the game play and the graphics it is so cool and i'm already at 4,000 power by just playing it for 4 minutes",5
"Good design, lots to do and little rewards as you go. Only been playing an hour but so far enjoying",4
This game is too nice graphic and nice model I like this game 100000000000000000,5
Good game. A nice twist to the usual build and wait strategy games I've played before. Good story with a viking theme,5
This is just like the others the way the game is played. The only difference is the story,3
It is an interesting game so far. I am slowly finding things out about the game,4
This game is very good but I want to suggest that please enable the taming area feature and let us ride the beasts.,4
It is my third time downloading this game.. And it's still cannot install even after completing the download.. now i can play without any problem.. Amazing game.. ##Love it,5
This game is so fun!!! It's hard and easy .I like how you have to upgrade your village. Best game ever,5
Gameplay is great. No problem so far. Graphics is pretty much good as well :),5
Very good game I really enjoyed this game and graphics are super,5
The best game I have ever faced more challenging no bugs no crashes everything is the best 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10,5
"Terrible 26.03.2 Have not been able to play really at all. The game keeps crashing everytime you try to navigate away from the main screen. Reported. Details sent. No follow up after 1 week. Follow up again. Advised to do a long list of checks, restarts etc, all the ""normal"" rubbish. Did these, also factory reset on wifi router. Still nothing. Reported again today. Same old questions and directions. All already done. Send through video or nothing. Avoid at all cost. Better elsewhere.",1
This game is fun to play i met a lot of new friends and we all tried our best in helping eachother out. One thing about this game is the lag and how slow you get when leveling up but still i'll give it a 4 star cause is really amazing how this is the only game where you conqure villages and take control of it🤌🏾,4
"It's still early, but so far it's got a nice tutorial, good graphics, and an interesting story.",4
Game is so repetitive that eventually you'll be just clicking on the red dots and doing everything it says. Having played so many similar games I got bored with this one in 2-3 days. It's like just follow all the commands and you don't have to use your brain.,2
It was pretty easy to get up in gathering stuff and getting better troops and more it's really really fun to play,5
It's my type of game and it's really fun I thought this was gonna be another knock-off of Minecraft or something but It isn't that It's just a fun game!,5
Really fun once I started o got stuck playing for hours,5
it's a really nice game I do enjoy playing it but there seems to be a lagging problem. the gameplay starts out good but after a few minutes of playing it lags so much and sometimes the game will either kick me out or I have a problem closing the game. other than that i don't have any other problems and would recommend downloading game.,3
"Well, it certainly seems like an excellent game. I wouldn't know, though, since it lags so extremely on mobile that I can barely play it. Either it crashes on its own less than five minutes in or the gameplay slows to such a crawl that I get fed up and quit. Here's hoping that an update will solve this. Will update review once I can actually play the game.",2
"This is a really good game. Good storyline, playability, UI, and game mechanics. There's the option to spend, but it's not shoved down your throat, so you can f2p if you wish. So far, really enjoying Viking Rise. It would be a great game if they fixed the rampant bugs ruining playability.",5
"This is literally the best mobile town builder game I've ever played. And I've gone through the app store and tried so so many. This one has amazing graphics, a good story, and better world building and world expansion. I also love the map, and the fact that the monsters are in the environment, rather than figures on a map you can send troops to. Instead, you can watch your troops fight on your island, while also being able to expand stuff at the same time. Lovely game, please keep updating ❤️",5
Now the audio is bugging and battery draining is a major issue. Device heating up so fast even the lowest graphics and lowest fps. Chats never disappear in chat boxes. They last forever. If you make it like a dissappear in 3 days or something you can save server space and much more fast connection. Thank you... 🐛,4
"Great game. Entertaining and engaging. If you like build and expanding village games, this one is for you. One comment though, hopefully there's a level gap restrictions when attacking another tribe. Some whales attack newbies for fun. It's not a good experience for those that are just starting. There should be a level grading system that prevents high ones attacking the low ones. Thanks!",4
Really fun game concept. Easy to control. Only reason it's not getting 5 stars is it's a little buggy after a while. It'll sound like a skipping CD/DVD if you know what that sounds like and then crash and close the app. But afterwards it opens up like normal. But after a while it'll do it again. But I'm enjoying the game. It works smoothly for the most part.,3
"The graphic is so good. The gameplay is similar to its type. Definitely free to play, but you can't be competitive with paid players as some of them already got million of powers in only two days. One of the servers I tried already has two of 20M+ power players just in three days. There are some strategies you can use to be more competitive as a free player or pay a little, but it doesn't worth the effort and time. Good game, but definitely doesn't worth my time.",3
"Looks like it could be a good game, but one huge problem with it. No protection for new players. I was only just getting my village started, played for about 30 to 60 mins I guess, got attacked by a very strong player and my whole village is on fire. I can't even see the map yet because I haven't made it that far into the game. Truly lame. Protect your new players or what is the point. I'll go back to Doomsday Last Survivors, much better.",2
So far so good! Definitely looks like this has tons of potential. Graphics are very good and things are explained well. My only gripe would be frame rate. It can be too slow at times. Also letters are a bit small but absolutely not off-putting. Overall and absolutely must play. I highly recommend it.,5
Good game. But im having a problem when learning skill. I was in skill guide but when undergoing it there's no button to touch and the game wont let me play it anymore . The game didnt lag so think is a bug. I can still play the game but the issue is i cant leveling up my character because of the skill guide,4
"Amazing. I've played many mobile based MMORPG's, but none of them are as well made as this one! You can absolutely make great progress without spending money on the game. It's fun, there's lots to do and a great community of millions across the world to get in contact with. Great gameplay, easy to understand, beautiful features and landscapes. Worth it!",5
"Wasted potential. Game works beautifully on 1st run and looks fun and graphically perfect, but 2nd run crashes on login, which is fixed by reinstall.... Once. Can't turn it back on no matter what I try. Wasted potential of a pretty neat looking game with fun gameplay.",2
"This game has got to make some update. First of all, my mails that I put on favourite mysteriously disappeared. Secondly, we should be given the right to delete unwanted characters ( I made a character on server 2 but realized I don't have the time to play too many characters but can't delete it). Last but most importantly, when our base's been attacked by some dude, there's no way for us to look for the guy, how are we gonna get back at them if we can't even locate the aggressor.",2
"At first I loved this game, I gave it 4 stars just after a week. But now I realise the game is just too long. Imagine not being able to increase the star level of your ""common"" hero's nevermind the epic and legendary ones. in other games I would have at least 2 epic hero's with more than 2 stars at the very least. Everything takes too long. If you get attacked and your wall needs maintenance expect to be maintaining it for weeks lol.",2
I couldn't play this game because everything is too small for me to see it very well. The wording is too small for my eyes. The color scheme is too dark and I noticed that I had trouble seeing certain things. Overall this game seemed fun.,3
"I really love the game, the way it is laid out and the graphics. I've not had any issues with the game lagging, freezing or closing out completely. The one issue I've had is that I'll play the game for awhile, then have to go do something but when i go back to wanting to the game, I have to restart from the very beginning. The game is not saving my stuff at all. If the game would save your progress then it would definitely get 5 stars.",4
"This game sounds wonderful. I would love to play it. However, the lag was so bad that it completely locked up my entire phone. I couldn't even back out of the game and my system UI was not responding. I may redownload the game when I get my laptop back and play on Bluestacks. But for phone, don't bother unless you have a top of the line beast of a phone.",2
Really good game and enjoyable to play. What can be improved is the teleports so more freedom to move around the map explore. Kingdom 1 is nearly full and many payers. This makes it more difficult to play without spending. Not even high level resources to get.,2
"I've been playing this game so far for about 2 weeks now. I really enjoy the theme, the scenarios, and the visuals. The concept is nice. Although I have been scouted and attacked many times, I no longer have the availability to heal my troops nor gather resources. I'm stuck. That being said, do I have to make purchases in order to get things going? There should be a limit gap on might/power for people to attack lower ones. And to also limit the times you get attacked by day.",2
"Game has great potential given the theme and style and such. However, the server-side lag and connection issues experienced by the end user are a deal-breaker. Until that problem is fixed, this real-time strategy software product is defective and therefore not ready for market in the USA. By default, because of the deal-breaker in the form of a lag/server-side connection issue for the end-user, this app gets 1-star or less at this time. Please fix immediately or pull from market until fixed.",1
"Great graphics, weather changes frequently causing different bonuses and slows speed of different functions which is amazing feature the game is very well designed very easy to pick up with clear instructions from totorial so takes no time to understand different mechanics. I'm very excited about experiencing the storyline. When asked to make a rating for the game I recommend giving it a rating so other people have an idea how much everyone playing this game absolutely loves it😧😮😯😲🤯🤩🤩🤩",5
"Good when it works, but so frustrating as it frequently crashes soon after loading or when moving between different tasks within the game, scrolling around on map etc. Have followed all advice from customer services - clear cache, reload game,restart tablet etc, but seems to make no difference. Would scored 4 or 5 if developers sort this out",1
"This game starts off like any other builder platform game, build, save rss repeat. With the option of strengthening your Hero's which I may add will take so long to do that it's kinda off puting! Also they need to make teleports to different parts of the map more viable/accessible if they expect people to grow without getting bored. Make more than 3 marches as at times you are waiting around with nothing do if your marches are gathering, I think 5 marches would be ideal and keeps us busy.",4
"Had a good first impression with graphics and pve progression, base building is well done and leaves a sense of achievement. Sadly, the good is washed away by the bad. Red crystal currency can circumvent every progression timer, and without limits on purchases of it, p2w Tribes already at 100m power run around obnoxiously ransacking and harassing anyone around them (99% of which have no way of repelling them). This is gameplay i definitely have no interest in, nor patience for. Uninstalled",2
"Promising game, just needs a bit better stability (few glitches, to be expected from a new game). Also if the interface could be a bit tidier, ability to minimize world chat and not have micro transactions deals all over the screen that would be great!",4
"The game is terrible. They tried to recreate last shelter, with a different skin. The events are terrible, worst in 20 years. The packs are all marked up at extra cost. All events rewards are terrible, massively reduced rewards. All drop rates for everything are hugely reduced, trying to get you to spend more. Disgusting and should be banned from the playstore.",1
"Enjoyable experience that compares better than other real time multiplayer strategy games. However, the app is incredibly glitchy. Often force closing in the middle of a battle and then having to repeatedly open the app only for it to force close. This is a typical pay to win game where whales reign supreme so if you're familiar with that this would be a good game minus the bugs.",2
I do enjoy the games that you create I do wish sometimes they would be slightly different to other style games I wish there was an option to have the higher level players not be able to attack newcomers or people under a certain level of them so if they're like 20 levels under them they shouldn't be able to attack them because it's unfair that newcomers and people who level up slowly who don't pay for advancing gets wiped out all the time but I do enjoy your games,4
"It's really a nice game. No difficulties and graphics are good. Very realistic. I recommend this game to everyone. Of you happens to play age of empire, it's looks exactly like that...just download and play. The only thing is it's only online and needs data. That's where I feel a bit bad cause it's very addictive",5
Same old concept nothing changed. Start from zero and end the game by uninstalling it. I remember when these types of games started when you can raise your army on as many resources as you have and there was fewer limits on each thing as these games have now. My army was about more than a million in half month. It was interesting but these games sucks.,1
"I just realized that its almost the same a the Wolf Game and yet both nailed the graphics and objectives. Why I love this game -Never given me glitches,app crash, or any technical difficulty - Diverse game most players are from Asia but what matters most is I never encountered toxic player yet. -Love the story flow and the monsters it is better and colors used is great match to character.",5
"I'm giving this 4 star. The game is pretty good however, it's a little bit crowded. You need to clean up the UI a little and end some redundant events here and there, the heroes imo are EXTREMELY hard to upgrade. It's just too much to take in for a mobile game.",4
"I love the game, it's fun to play. But I'll give a 2 star because the game freeze when entering the hero VARKA DETAILS, I followed the tutorial instructions about SKILL UPGRADE and the game completely freeze. I restart the game but nothing works, it always freeze when entering the hero details. Please fixed this bud🙏",2
"I've been playing the game about 30 minutes. I'm at level 3....how do you gather wood?. Need to kill wild boar to collect wood, can't kill boar as need troops, can't build enough troops as I need wood!!!...trees everywhere and can't cut them down!..to be out of resources at level 3 doesn't give me confidence in the game...so far it's irritating. I'll give it a bit more time before I delete.",2
"Worst game design ever. The game is about gathering might via buildings, troops and heroes. They butter you up with resources allowing you to grow fast, only to serve to the top tier players. I left out more resources than my warehouse allows me to keep safe (which is the bare minimum). Only to wake up one day to find out I've been attacked by the number one player 8 times, losing all of my resources. Customer support won't do anything. There is no form of rank tiers for attacks, like in CoC.",1
"So far I'm very pleased with the overall look and mechanics of the game, I feel the performance could be tweaked having some slowdown times with some aspects; but yes definitely feeling what they have created. I will definitely keep going forward to see how things progress. Could be One of the better games of it's type...",4
Loving this game so far ... graphics are lovely and really immersive. Especially for a phone game ... real eye candy. It is very similar to many other farm resource and gain territory game but feels so nice to play. Hope it doesn't get too silly and break the immersion by having to OP and unbelievable heroes appear that only the P2W guys can get. Loving it so far ... keep it up.,5
Probably would give it a better rating as seems like a good game however the buildings or trees aren't showing up at all. I can only see the location of them marked when dragging the map. I can't see where the building are otherwise.,1
"Started playing this over the course of a week or so. Closed it out and didn't log back in for a few days. All of my progress was gone. I tried switching accounts and logging in, everything gone. So I'm uninstalling. That's ridiculous.",1
"So far a fun game. I get disappointed in this style of game where you build, build, build, and then have a CC player come and take everything. Hopefully this doesn't turn out to be one of those. The graphics are great and the play , so far, it straight forward and entertaining.",4
"I really like this game. It is complex, social, and enjoyable. There are 2 things which hold back the 5th star. 1. On a phone, instead of a tablet, some of the text is too small to read. 2. The extreme p2w players distort servers. I know your company needs to make $$$, but I it will make me quit soon. It should be capped better.",4
"Nice game, can be a little bit too overwhelming, but focusing on a few things can help. I just have one problem, the screen is too cluttered. I am not playing on a tablet, or an emulator. So an option to clear up the screen would be very much appreciated. Otherwise, as I said, nice game.",4
"If you're looking for a utterly frustrating gaming experience; that crashes, every 2 - 5 minutes; well then friends, you've hit the motherlode, with this one. Laggy, Buggy, and any other verb implying a negative connotation applies. In a word, ""unplayable"".",1
"Viking Risebis worst game!!!!! This is the worst game in the world!!! Advertising of this game climbs from all the cracks and it is impossible to turn off this ad! The game is very bad, obsessive and stupid! I do not recommend this game to anyone and I hope that the developers of this game will soon go bankrupt and disappear! They will be sweeping the streets instead of creating such horrible games! Their product managers have the lowest level of intelligence possible!!!",1
This great game in a way it reminds me of age of empires,5
Fun game with excellent graphics,5
"Don't make it a gathering game. Vikings are raiders, they hardly farm or gather, and they invade other nations for resources. what we are doing now is gathering resources 24h/7 and hardly fighting other tribes for fear of losing troops. what you should do is get rid of gathering altogether and let players build buildings that farm and gather for them, let walls and towers be hard to kill but raid weapons easy to make so we could raid as much as we want.",3
It's best strategy game ever Graphic is good but it should be more resources as well as Hero should be seen in between walking and fighting 👍,5
Good game so far but change up the daily commander also game has been crashing alot lately fix the issues might give higher rating if you do,3
It fun don't get me wrong I just wish that the game is a bit more realistic like were the troops eat food in stead of food being used for building. Food can be used for building and the townspeople can also eat food and that is all I want say. I hope the you awesome developers can update the game.,4
Loading screen takes too long mann.. (edit: i liked the service given that related to my problems to the game..),5
Fun and easy to understand,5
Amazing! But we need horses when we march long distance 😁😅,5
Amazing game. Great customer service. No ads. Purchase add ons are well worth the money. Lots of events to keep you occupied. Frequently adds new content/events also. Been playing for 3 months now and can't fault it in anyway!,5
It's the best game 🎮 Ever for wars and buildings,5
"1 STAR - STOLEN GAME Im surprised no one else mentioned this, but this game is a complete copy of Rise of Kingdoms. The entire ui is ripped from RoK and reskinned, along with all the ideas and functions from RoK. The only difference seems to be how the world looks and the commanders. Furthermore, the commanders are complete replicas of the characters in the show Vikings, with no credit given. Stealing someone else's creation for money is just wrong.",1
Lots of unnecessary button tapping. This is more of a finger tapping exercise app than an actual playable game,2
I took a few week break to come back to all of my progress gone I was super mad because I spent so much time and effort for it all to be deleted unless it is fixed I won't change my rating nor will I play the game,1
I like it but It's so very slow and heats up alot even on lowest settings. Once the games optimized better then I can give it a 4. But there is something bothering me and that's the fact it's like every other game like this building farming resources and such. Despite it being vikings I wish there was more to stand apart from the rest...especially when I know how every server ends with money spenders wiping everything.,3
"I just started the game a couple hours ago and it's so far is pretty entertaining. The graphics are well done and it's pretty neatly laid out. It's a little confusing though on doing certain things in the game and does take time to remember what exactly to do, but overall it is better than some of the other games I have played. Hopefully this game company stays on track without falling like many of the other games out there. If something changes for the worse I will edit my review.",4
Very enjoyable an addicting,5
"The best stratergy game ever played, and I've had my fair share of stratergy game....This takes the CROWN 👑. The grafics are all top notch",5
Second time playing it. I must like it. 4/5 because I don't give 5s.,4
only playing an hour but pretty cool so far,4
"Mediocre game, whis nothing new and no method to control the battles, bad battery consumption and overheating because is bad optimize.",2
awesome game play ... just love playing the game its so relaxing 🤘💯❤️,5
This game keeps me awake at night that is how good it is for me it keeps you busy,5
"It's been a nice game so far, but I dislike that there is too much dialog and a long tutorial, I would like to have a 'skip tutorial' button. I've been playing a lot of look alike games and is kind annoying to repeat and do a pretty long tutorial",3
"I'm new to this type of game, so I love that it promps me to do what is needed to help me learn the game play. The graphics are superb, as well as the sound effects. Some parts are a bit confusing to me, and I'm sure with some research and continued game play, it will sort itself out. This game keeps me intrigued to continue playing.",5
"The game is awesome, I really enjoy the way we have to gather it make it more active and hands on. One problem, I can't communicate with group or change my charter name due to when you click on keyboard it doesn't come up or it does but as soon as u click on line to type it goes back or out and have to click on it several times, so u just give up changing name or chat with others.",4
"best game for now june 13,2023 its like realistic strategy game that doing some task to improve your village .Pls optimized for more user to have a better playing to our mobile and thats all .Keep it up and your game will be grow soon.",5
This game is so Good. strategy. Tribe managing. many other things you will experience.,5
Great start! Story line is great. Just started so check back in a few days...,5
No sound after playing for awhile..that's why I have given it 2 stars..fix this and I'll change the rating.,2
"Feels very satisfying playing,the fluent music is just 👍👍👍 graphics are pretty good and cool",5
I gave 5 🌟 but if guys can make one for story line but offline please I would like,5
Good game maybe add a item that lets you switch server kingdoms instead of having to make a new account but overall nice game,5
I really enjoy this game! The story is good. The game play is easy to figure out. It is different from other games I have tried. So far it is great!,5
"It's just a reskin of all other city builders. Reminds me of Farmville. Nothing new, nothing exciting. These kinds of games came out in droves, when I was a kid, and you only had to pay for them once. Mobile games are a scam and this one is no different. It seems rather well done, though. It's just not a game as much as it is a simulation.",1
Kinda stagnates. The start screen just says loading now and sits with tips rotating on the screen.,2
"Game ok, some game play is a bit strange",4
"I haven't been playing long, but so far, so good. This game is sort of a fleshed out version of others (RoK, Call of Dragons, etc.) just with a Viking theme instead. The tutorial is fairly intuitive, & adequately trains you early game. The graphics are decent, & give you a pretty good immersed feel, albeit for a Mobile RTS game. I may update my review, as I get involved deeper in game.",5
Im confuse to the tasking scenarios of hopefully could roam freely navigate the maps. The Graphics are smoothly awesome. Yet the battle scene is quite arcadely done. Still im giving it thumbs up 5 star for this. Yet its not enough. We need more eerie and spoky to smell and feel about the true nordesman so with the vikings spirits.,5
This game sucks. It allows you to get attacked while still in tutorial mode and or when Your offline in the beginners stage. If you don't have money to play don't bother. Game do look like it could be fun though.... You got the money.,1
Would be a 5 Star if it didn't keep booting out to the Desktop. It's Very Annoying.Now takes several attempts to get back in. Other similar games I play all load and work fine. Tried 10 times to connect to Server. All Failed. Now uninstalling the game. I've had enough.,1
The story of the game was too good and Also have good graphics the good thing is that there is no bugs in this game,5
Nice development game... Slow pace & doesn't require u to be online 24/7,4
"It's a cool game , great concept BUT it's for the avid gamer that can spend hours on it. Lots of depth in the game so you can get lost in the lore. I would check the app optimisation, game crashed a number of times on me.",4
This game is very............ Nice but graphic's can do batter,4
I played a number of strats. Started this one and low and behold...on my first day I progressed to lev 8. Went offline a few hours. Came back and wham...attacked by a lev 24. When are developers going to learn the frustration of higher levels attacking lower? I am so glad I havent spent money yet. Uninstalled,2
Lots of stuff to do although get hung up in beginning with the stone resources,4
"Waste of time,there's very little interaction with others and you just end up building and upgrading without any significant advance in game.Its like being stuck in mud,a slow slog with a directionless focus.Must do better.",1
"Not like the adds but still a great game, I wish I could fish up a dragon egg and have a 1st person mode",4
"The game is fantastic 😍 I am enjoying the game and I hope they could upgrade for another great version like this in future, thanks 🙏👍",5
"I think it's a really good game so I am giving it 5 Stars most people don't like it much because of lagging and other random things, but give them some slack because the game is still new",5
It's good but sometimes it gets glitch or hang,5
"It is a very interesting game. The events are fun. I like that you can go back to your walk through for a refresh. Hopefully there are respectful alliances/guilds. One thing I wish we were able to do, is have a solo option and a pet dragon or cool mythical pet of sorts. Also to upload our own photo for the avatar. Other than that, awesome well thought game. Not many bugs or glitches. 😈😁",3
Game has become very laggy and unplayable,1
"Love this game it has great graphic , etc.",5
As of this point I'll give it a 4 room for improvement but not real issues yet. ok been playing a couple of weeks more now and it's full of glitches that Devs don't believe unless you have video of it happening. Like beast lair sending your whole clan home burning battle and healing to 100% or summoning Valkyries to have them not turn up. There's also the constant buffering or kicking you out the game. It's getting to the point and my friends are thinking of giving up.,1
"Was really enjoying this game but have experienced a glitch early on which is detracting from the game as I am now stuck at chapter 4 because the enemy did not spawn in properly. Tried reinstalling to start again, but my progress had saved by linking my account :(... without my issue I would be 4-5 🌟🌟🌟🌟",3
"game is good and nice to play, need some 3d visual to see in fight to make more interesting.",4
"A fun enough game, does the same thing every other game does of it's genre. Has 0 way to defend or discourage people attacking lower levels. If you're not willing to spend ludicrous amounts of money on this game, do not download. If you're looking for a way to waste money, you're in the right place.",2
"I like this game. The graphics are also great. The only problem is the lack of resources, but it's manageable. It would be good if the players could farm food and plant trees. It would also be good if there are treasure troves like mines.",4
Very good game but when we lose from other player they say you are hacker and report me but I am not hacker but remove my I'd from game,4
"I thought the game was different but it's just pay to play. You can't even attack monsters on the map and you get attacked!!!! So once you are a target for the spenders you are stuffed you can't do anything, unless you spend lots of money!!!! It's absolutely ridiculous that this is what is called a game today, it's just one big fat sales package",1
I like the face this particular game makes a stop and read . Easy instructions what how to build .,5
Needs better explanation if your slow,3
Good game. Please add hero resetting stone can be obtain via shop or events... Add more powerfull battle sound/skill effects.^^,5
"Loved this game until I unwilling jumped myself back to the begining by accident. Never really was into these types of games until this one had me hooked. Maybe my lack of knowledge of the features is blame, whatever the case I was pissed. Might delete. Maybe... Probably not!",3
"Wow, what a great gane....everything is fun, from free troop movements to so many mini quests and missions...takes a while to get the hand of it, but def worth it. Fully agree with Wolf... Keep it up. Regards, Bjørn Ironside. P.s. One question though, everyone is a bit puzzled about the beast taming/ Mounted Units...Lot of us liberated that village, but we cannot access it..Any suggestion/ advice?",5
Way too time consuming in order to progress. Uninstalling for a better game.,1
"Just downloaded the game about 3 hours ago and I'm already addicted. I play Vikingard and was excited to see this viking game, but was hesitant when I saw it had 500k downloads. Then I realized this is a fairly new game so I gave it a shot. So glad I did!! It's easy, straight forward, and I'm liking the storyline. I definitely feel driven to increase my power levels and play a lot. It doesn't seem (so far) like a pay-to-win game, which is awesome. Rewards are given out handsomely as well!",5
Really amazing but you can increase more graphics and resolution for better experience like a hd settings,4
The game is fun exciting smooth running and no lagging everything responds when you no waiting after tapping an option automatic response game also runs very smoothly during the combat also during the gathering resources it also runs smoothly while doing all these definitely a game to choose for someone to have some calm gaming,5
I think this game is excellent.except for the glitches..I'd like to try it again ..hope it's fixed,4
"Honestly, I had high Hope's for this one.But at the end of the day, I'm tired of games that all you really do is just constantly upgrade and research endlessly.Upgrade to level 1 then you gotta get to level 2 then 3 and so on.It just never ends.There's honestly no point.Let's just pick a era with units and just play.Make actual battle tactics and troop placement maybe terrain differences the diffrence makers in battles.Not just who has the higher upgrades.That's why these games are all the same.",3
"Good game but now... My game has been stuck,,, I don't know why,,, plz fix this",3
Really fun to play but the characters dialogue is kind of annoying cause I can't just build up,4
It's a very worst. Game not character level up and very large time of upgrade,1
"Too much info for a phone... too much unlocking things. But, passes the time.",3
Great story play over all but the fighting not much entertaining so that's why I rated it 4 stars if it gets better cause I just started I'll add another star..,4
"Glitchy. Keeps throwing me out to blank screen. The game is high on graphics, complicated to keep your interest, but I can only play for 2 mins before it throws me out again. Despite my tablet being brand new with bags of storage space. Pity.",3
Littlebit similar to Infinity Kingdom and Game of Khan can't play multiplayer with friends yet i have used it just for 2 hours ago may be it would be?????,3
"This game gives me the real vibes I wanna feel when playing a Nordic/viking feeling/or just midevil game like skyrim. Only things I noticed are some freeze ups which aren't bad at all, that happens with almost every game when loading alot of code and is easily fixable. Highly recommend it if you wanna have a feeling of Clash of clans mixed with skyrim but 20x better.",5
"All is good, but game buffers a lot. My internet connection is good but the game keep buffering.",2
"Design budget seems to be around 300$, nothing good apart from graphics and voiceover effort which is a waste on this creatively bankrupt ""game"", spend crystals, skip building time, build army, attack X on the map. There should be option where people could block and refuse to see ads or suggestions for games such as this.",1
This app is great I like the way you conquer other villages and the controls they are epic I give this game 5 stars,5
"This is a game where good clan members teamwork and synergy is an absolute must. Loads of fun, guaranteed.",5
"Not really like it shows in the video, takes lots of time and resources",3
"Best game on the store, excellent graphics all around great experience.",5
It's great but very confusing. Tutorials are very hard to understand and I can't keep up.,4
This is so easy so far. And I love it!,5
"Very similar to other games that I've play, but I find this one has a better flow to the story line.",4
"A little complicated, but I like the challenge",4
It is so good abd I love how you dont have to read everything and most of the time it reads the text to you But its my opinion,5
"wonderful game! I have a little suggestion tho, can ya guys add a list of codes that are still working? It would save us the hassle of going to google and other social platforms.",5
One of the best game and gaming experience is very good 👍👍.,5
"This games rewards are the WORST! Skip this city builder for a dif one with better rewards. My main issue is not so much THIS game but a issue amongst these types of games, and that is they die off quickly. What starts off a active server is dead in under a month and it's not from being bullied by big players. It's boredom! Leaders make these rules you can't attack which imo kills it faster. When I download a war game I expect to have war! Miss the days ppl weren't afraid to lose troops.",3
"I really love this game too much, to the point I'm spending money for this game, but for now I'll give 4 stars due to the following reason: 1. The battle animation are suck and it was not satisfying even though i know i won against my enemy. 2. The move of army, when I'm tapping my army manually and want to move them to make a formation sometimes it was not responding. 3. Lastly the life points, can you please add some life points(number) to the monsters.",4
Easy to learn just hard to get rrs,3
"I couldn't make much progress in the game because of the 'loading circle' that keeps popping up. Sometimes it disappears quickly, but other times it takes a long time to go away, which can be frustrating and feel like a waste of time.",1
"Not bad!! I usually tire of these types of games quickly as i rarely like training infantry and archers and the such -- I'm more into the building aspect of the game, but so far I'm really loving it!! It's not overbearing and i can comfortably build my little viking city! Awesome, will recommend!",4
The graphics is nice and you dont need a money to make a faster upgrades.,5
Very fun and easy not to long of builds so far but I know it will change other than that nice game and good mail gifts,5
"Time for studying the game, not yet a good rate",4
"This game is overall pretty good. Sometimes the ""exit menu"" button is on the top left instead of the top right, which is the reason for the missing star. If it was all the time to cater to left handed people I'd understand, but it switches and that's annoying.",4
"I want to reset the game data, but even after deleting and reinstalling the game, it continues to load",4
"For the last few hours, i enjoy this game. Will see for the next few days. Update. I spent money and it made me happy 🥲",5
Best game and it has great character.but it is to difficult to open their skills otherwise bit is best.,4
I'm not used to these sorts of games. Not bad. Keeps you engaged on a slow lazy kind of day.,4
good graphics but missing basic points. No way to grow resources. have to depend on upgrades for basic needs. felt like a good game at first bt it became boring as you dont have resources to grow your town.,1
This is the best game I ever played. I gave it at 5 out of a 100.,5
"Very nice & graphic game, lik it!",5
Amazing game no ads and doesn't take long to get used to it so down load it!!!,4
"Wonderful. Play it, it's fun and interesting!",5
I am not a fan of IGG but this game seemed interesting so i gave it a try. No surprises. Now im even a lesser fan. It takes far too long to advance through the story chapters. Very few speedjps to help. It takes ages to build your troops to defeat enemies which increasi get stronger after every battle. You'll need to spend...spend...spend to get anywhere in this game. Tyypical IGG greed!!,1
Very engrossing. Let's see how it goes. Voices are a bit too Americanfied.,5
It is a really fun and a cool game but when i move over to the squed base...it looks like theres a tornado of pixels like literly i dont think thats what a tornado looks like but im going to still give it four stars couse it is a great game/im not shore if its a bug or somehting couse it lags so mutch and it also looks like land is treching out all over my screen.,4
"All you peasants cryning about the lag just need newer devices, I haven't had any lag with my Galaxy S23 ultra. Always something to get into in this game and I haven't even began to scratch the surface. Hopefully the game manages to hold my interest because in other strategy/war games of this type get old and stale fast once you max everything out. (Yes im talking to you war for EOS and Mz)",4
It's really fun playing this game but the in-game purchasing is a downer,5
The game is amazing it's like the only game I want to play,5
Bestest strategy game out there good graphics easy to play and overall one of my top mobile games I recommend everyone who is into strategy games and if not into them then this game will change your or their minds.The only bad thing is that it lags frequently and that it takes up almost a gigabyte of storage. Whover out there is reading this thank you and may god bless you and the developers.,5
It's a great game. Keeps me busy and also very informal on the tutorials.,5
Big issue of advertising,1
"The game is so cool, but I'll be more happy if you add the arabic language for this game. Good luck, game developers.",5
Its a pretty decent game not the best but it's pretty good,5
"I hate this game! When I started to play it, It was so much fun, the game was fantastic, but there's a problem with it: it's pay to win. For those who doesn't have money to spend, you have to wait hours even days to do anything, (as you improve in the game). But there will be players who spend money to get strong faster. So you have to deal with them attacking you to stole your resources that you've collected for days. that's what I don't like about this game, It's unfair to the poor players.",1
"Very different from the adds shown, way less action and freedom of movement and evolution... timer game",3
Unable to switch kingdoms in order to be in the same tribe as my wife and friends. Not sure why this ability was taken away.,1
The game is great but it lags alot. Dope graphics and great strategy.,3
I love this game but wish you could turn the building around and customize the characters,4
"Not too bad graphics but just such a boring game. Wish it was more of a find resources and build a village, fight bandit camps and creatures as you explore the map kind of game. Play the same as most mobile games. Purchase pre made buildings with resources, find loot, train a hero, join an alliance blah blah...ZZZ",2
Fun game so far and not full of adds or making me buy coins,5
From the ads i thought it was not that great but when I downloaded it I was very surprised and i recommend this game,5
"Good game,but for one thing the time it takes to build up your city/forces.not every city would progress the same.i wish game apps would release this. Because instead of being a good game they would be excellent ones. It get boring because of that.would give five stars if you could build city/force faster.wish someone would come out with one like that. Only a suggestion. Hope they listen.",2
I've played lots of similar games before but this one is certainly the best of them all Firstly it gives you lots of recourses and speed ups regularly to build up not too much and not too few The only thing i wish they added was a base layout system that sets your base layout to best available options like Rise of Empires does Also troop healing can be pretty expensive if you have lots of wounded soldiers but other than that it's pretty awesome i highly recommend if you love games like this,4
Its a nice game and here u can make ur millatry its really easy to make a city,5
Nice Game! The Graphics Are Decent The Storyline Is Great! The Characters Are Nice Vikings Are My Favorite! Overall 5 Stars!,5
"Amazing, Fantastic, Excellent. This game is the best game I have ever played, you can get addicted to this.",5
Awesome game good graphics really like how smooth it feels there's no lag and really did the story,5
Love the graphics and there's no ads!! Surprise! Really recommended game,5
It is so romantic ☺️the way how it looks great in graphics and in sounds I Love it so much😚✨,5
Very immersive and simple to use almost perfection have to play more.,5
"It's a really fun game, just really slow going if you're f2p.",4
"So far the game has been enjoyable, the ganeplay is fun and immersive.",4
Its very engaging and the story is straightforward and mission based!,4
best game so far but there are two reasons which i don't like 1 too much ads 2 the chat button tell me how do i get rid of this chat ... fix it asap,3
"I'm not sure, it's still like alot of mobile games. Tired of non console type games",3
"It's a nice game, concept is great but it gets to a stage where you have to pay to win.",3
"Really enjoying it so far, early days of building but it's enjoyable, it's getting better",5
Nice game really funny how meat grow on plants,5
A very interactive game plenty of stuff to do Plan for a few hours and Ain't bored yet,4
The very bad thing is higher level can attack lower ones without any restrictions 😞😞😞😞,3
It is amazing game. Who want to play and watch Vikings should be very intelligent.,5
Great graphics and interesting g story with cool features a must play,5
This game is very good it contains a ton of things to do and a wide variety of land to claim,5
I've played many games like this one but damn this one allows you to be attacked by others as soon as you start the game. Usually you have a shield over you until you reach a certain level but I was only at level 3. What a deterrence that is for starters.,3
Nice game and sometimes bored,5
At first it was a little tricky and the audio is broken but other than that it is an over all good game.,4
No skill required to play this game... This is time wasting and addictive game... Please stay away from this game... You need to waste your money to get powerful... That's it... My suggestions don't go for it... I have been playing this from last 5 months and now it's hard to come out of it... Please stay away,1
"Cool story line, characters and tutorials are great, but really laggy and that sucks A$$.....",4
Can't get past load screen.,1
Fun play. AI assistance is helpful. Needs better in-game instruction database.,4
"So far I've really enjoyed playing this. The story is exciting, and the gameplay is intriguing!",5
Very interesting game with lovely graphics and an interesting story mode.,5
"AFTER THE CENTER IS CONQUERED THERE IS NOTHING TO DO! Bullying is a MAJOR PROBLEM in this game! Chat, DM, & on discord! I'm not spending another cent! not being able to move during frenzy is RIDICULOUS! should be able to at least port away. No shield is understandable, but they should have to hunt me down for revenge! Also, Very little information on update content or new/upcoming events.",1
I love the challenges to the game thanks,5
"The game has an appealing theme and impressive graphics, as well as challenging missions and various skills to acquire. However, my enthusiasm for the game was dampened when I discovered that it is not possible to switch servers or create an account on a specific server to play with my friends. Regrettably, this limitation prevents me from enjoying the game with my preferred group of players, and as a result, I can only give it a one-star rating",1
"Great fun, I play all the time few bugs but they fix them pretty quick.",5
I like that each game like this improves upon the last as far as interface. Kudos to you developers!,5
"Just a waste of time.. Once you run out of your resources, specifically log, there is no other way out to get more log. Resulting, you won't get any of your troops healed or upgrade nything.",1
"New update is unplayable. It keeps crashing. My phone got a fever. So sexy, very hot device. Do not download the update. You will irritate on the glitches and lagging and crashing.",1
Fun and easy to plat,5
"Too much lag, and I just purchased a new phone recently, everything is updated. Just Fire Age with different setup. Probably gotta buy shields eventually, join a clan, blah blah blah. Get decimated by players that spend. 3 star solely because it has a Viking Theme, otherwise I wouldn't even left a review, which = zero stars.",3
"Engaging start-up and easy UI. Typical of modern games, each turn/level has an increasing enforced time delay. This is where it falls far short of classics like AOE. Just let us play more quickly!",3
It's fun and it takes time but you can get on an Nvidia wants and make sure to get stuff building,5
A great game the flaw is that the time limit to do things are so long I mean 30 days is a little too much,4
It's the same as it is in the ad,5
"The game is so good and it has potential to become best strategy game ,just need to optimize the game server for ping issue and lagging issue in some part of the game,need to provide more hero summoning stone as we require lot of hero shards to upgrade stars. Looking forward to see those things in upcoming updates.",4
"Not what the ad shows. Typical build, join clan, war",4
loving the strategy elements....Need to make mistakes to learn interesting in the execution.,4
I m very upset I know my favourite series game but I play game this game every player strong up this paid only paid an paid I hate this your paid game,1
"This game really gives you the mind of a viking, it's nice 👍",5
"This game is realy fantastic ,it made me the fan of Vikings rise",5
Enjoyable and fun but honestly there are so many games like this one but if Vikings are your favourites then great game.,4
A traditional mobile 4x strategy with leader troop tactic skill and territory defending management.. hopefully with hero weapon skill upgrade and monster breeding for pvp or pve siege.. Nice one!!,4
Very fun game! Its easy to level up your camp and everything's free!,5
i love this game but it need a strong phone and we need more languages and There is difficulty in moving the village the camera is bad,3
"Awesome little strategic, birds eye rpg game. Build your village and purge!",5
I enjoy the game and what it has to offer also the story is greatly designed.,4
an amazing game i need part 2 of this game and make part 2 easy,5
"Great game in my opinion and im so fussy with games, bit of advice to new comers tho upgrade your chief hall enough so you can build a warehouse as soon as possible",5
Very nice game and many prize and I'm not gonna worry about the resources because of task it gave many food and resources when you do it,5
"Look , over all the game is good Not the best graphics but works fine Not the best story line I saw better It needs alot of grinding and time March system need to be more realistic Also im actually not satisfied with only viking to choose, even tho it's viking game but needs more factions More story line for vikings wars with others , etc The city from inside is not 100% free to control, you just gotta open more areas while u lvl up Few updates will make thos game known",3
"Much good , NGL the game is too good but it would be perfect if every castle level looked different out there in the map, the appearance is all same outside on the map except for the level tag of castles which makes it hard to understand , it would be much clean if every outer castle look different each and every level",4
Yes u like this game very much but only the thing is that we are not able to complete the area at the certain I will tell that pls fix this,5
Love the graphics,4
"I love all the animations, graphics, and actions! quite exciting",5
"The game is very interesting to Play and really like the game a lot it a Strategy and Build Game and Fighting Along the way you attacking dragons Wolves and many creatures and its very exciting to actually play the game If your not playing this Game your really Missing out you build your Armies strength up it packed with so many features and many of many Events created. Now, it taking me quite a bit of time to get use of the button Where the Shield Icon Button to Protect my base? Great Game.",4
It's an awesome experience although the graphics should be sorted out,4
"This can be fun, I stopped playing because when you promise something to your customer and never send it, that is a -5 stars, now I cannot even load the game properly, everytime I tried to claim a reward of get materials to build something the game crashed. So that is another -5 stars. I have to give one star inorder to post this but does not mean I want to give a star to them , they deserve negative -10stars",1
Animation is not that good,2
Ot is awesome game because the graphics and the ways the players are is just amazing so please download this game And just play with your experience,5
Lets see ... If you enjoy getting hit multiple times in minutes ... Wiping your troops out forcing to spend to replenish because there is NO PASSIVE RESOURCES .. or you have to quit your job to grind resources .... ENJOY,1
It's easy to level up!,1
To small couldn't see game very well and couldn't figure out how to do anything after two camps one and two other buildings were built. Couldn't clear any trees not nothing. Can't zoom in can't do anything. After like six minutes in. Needs work hopefully they do not turn into fire and ice money hungry game.,2
Game keeps crashing,2
Really good game kinda laggy and wierd voice lines but really good game though:) (Note don't change anything),5
"Big spenders spoil the fun, but a good game",4
Not many ads,5
good introduction to game and good idea of game play,4
Love the Viking theme and the gameplay,5
"Love this game, lots to do to keep me busy",5
so far easy and fun.,4
free player so far 1 day into it can manage,5
"So far so good apart from it being very slow and glitchy, even with the frame rate low and low graphics. If that could be improved for much smoother gameplay would give it a higher rating",3
Great game to past an hour while you're waiting,5
"It's very nice game, I love it though, let me jums give you 4 star for now",4
In my game not getting uploaded profile picture . Help me,5
Not work always error,1
I really like this game a lot and I will continue to play it.,5
Can't say much about the game it didn't even load up just keeps saying login error.,2
"Fun but looks like a game where the more deeper you play, the more time consuming.",4
Game is good but kindly fix the bugs it's killing my patience and translation is way off.,4
Good game just download and try it . I know why you wondering I give this game 4 because of laging not that much but little bit it doesn't on your playing.,4
The law of the jungle event is soooooo glitchy and laggy. On top of that if you're at 1 mil might you get paired with a bunch of 20mil might people so you can never win. Who came up with that dumb logic???!!!! Maybe you should pair those with similar level of might to make the game fair. Life is not fair but at least a game can be. Make it happen!!! Ffs,1
"I can not give any star because very bad server ""Your Log in was expired '' notice was appear within 12 hours that's all of my playing time Very bad server",1
"You guys have out done yourselves. The graphics are stunning, the music is fantastic. It's not the classic RPG but it's very fun. Well done. I can see some Assassin's Creed style characters sneaked in.",4
It's ok slowly getting the hang of things. Great graphics though,3
its super good i love it but sometimes it lages and i cant enter,4
They didn't give option to log in with fb or google... I've lost my id of might 20 millions,1
One of the best game that I ever play. Visual and background music are top notched.,5
"Nice graphic, good content and the first one I've played that is not pay to win. you can grind, lot's of ways to earn resources and speed up....abit hard on ranking up your heroes but fair enough cause everything else is easy to get. you can pay to get some but that's totally up to you.",5
The reason why I gave it 3 is because the game only lags . But otherwise its a good game,3
"Game got very sluggish by the time I upgraded my buildings to level 5, then the game crashed every time I tried to start it up. I will be uninstalling it, since it will no longer run.",1
"Good Game and nice graphics, but game will become stagnant after 4-5 days due to abnormally high research/development time. And not to forget they have in game tasks that requires compulsory payments from player to progress. So basically pay to win after 4-5 days.",1
"I've not played for long but the graphics are the best I've ever seen in this kind of game. So far the only real complaint I have is that you can't rotate or easily move the buildings. But I really am enjoying playing it, and am excited for what more there is to discover.",5
Very simple than other strategy games. I love it. Thanks developers. Cheers.,5
Alot of bugs it screen keeps on reload some time you were unable to login after this update it freeze alot,1
"Until now is very nice, I should play a little bit more to have a concrete opinion",4
Looking for a game to pass time?.This is perfect..I'm loving it mainly because I'm a viking fan and I love Eivor of the Raven Clan. This game is perfect and I can't wait for when they add more buildings or even structures or whatever. Mobile games get tiresome quickly but this game will make j want more and more. You might have to wait for some upgrades lol 😄😃❤,4
i think this is the game ive ever playef like a clash of clans brooo it was sooo coool i rate it for 5 stars,5
why cannot send resources to other player?,2
"Just reviewed the experience after one week of playing the game. While I'm completely awed with the story, I'm pretty much disappointed by the fact that it doesn't run smoothly at all. Maybe they will upgrade the quality some time... Until then, 3* for the gameplay",3
I'm really enjoying this game! I thought you just have to grind to expand your city but I'm shook that this is sort of like clash of clans.,5
"Great design, easy to follow, give it 20 min and you'll catch on.",4
Graphics good and the hero summoning is great for a game. And its fun to play.,5
"Interesting so far, the only bad part is the UI is a little crowded at the top",4
Looks and plays as well and fast as the ads. Decent story.,5
The game was excellent so far until Developper let bots take over (selling ressources) now new server after 5 days player are 200 million might in strength. Not recommended at all untill IGG DEV fix that by banning byers,1
I personally love this game because the game graphics is to good and the game characters are also too cool,4
An enjoyable game overall but not too dissimilar to others it appears to me there's a lack of invasion in development they should employ an author to evoke a notable storyline something along the lines of classic text based games of the 1980s if you've never heard of or tried Google them & give them ago.,3
I really like it and it's good to rest strategy 😁,4
"1 day of playing, so far looks interesting, I'm enjoying",4
I love it 💞 it is a lot of fun and I recommend it to everyone 😜😁,5
worth playing for i love the game play its always pure gameplay strategy,5
It a fun game and building up a Viking village is pretty cool and it gives you plenty of things to do great game five stars,5
Cool strategy game.. I love this game. One of my fave if anybody ask.. Hahah,5
Fun game so far. Easy to learn,4
A couple hours in and it seems great so far,5
It's graphics is very nice,5
"This game is The pay-to-win. There are other players who spend a ton of money and can destroy you whenever they wish... beside that, after a week or so, it becomes boring and you have to gather and gather and gather and wait for A WEEK to upgrade your townhall. Meanwhile other players just pay and skip the waiting.",1
"Not bad, it's enjoyable to play",4
"Fun, easy builder that is well done which can be hard to say in such a classic genre.",5
"Now, I was expecting it to be like every other strategy game, but this is different",5
Love the graphics. Need more tutorials. Keeps you engaged.,4
Giving 4 stats as I'm still very new in the game and so far game play is great... will do a update later if I keep the game that long,4
Very interactive and fun.,5
"As of right now the game is pretty good there is a loading error glitch sometimes but that might just be my phone doing it. The characters and their backstories are very well written. The story itself is also well written, I also just love the fact it is viking themed always loved these kind of games. Keep up the great work and I can't wait to see what you all have in store for us in the future!!!",5
The best game in Arsenal، and really unique and the rapture of the oldest and the most awesome game in the world of mobile,5
"Why did you make a portrait video of this game? It'd be better as for me, to be playing in the portrait orientation just like in the video than in the landscape orientation of the game that we play at the present. It's more of a 3D action, I mean the portrait mode. Thanks, IGG devs! 🤗",5
I love playing and placing the game. Great graphics... Ang ganda neto laruin guys promise,5
Really good game and easy to follow.,5
It's awesome but plz add mount feature 🙏,4
"Great Game , hoping for more players to join",5
"Game is designed well, till now I am enjoying. Will share feedback again",5

Very difficult to get RSS.,1
Pretty Kickazz game. Haven't put it down since I started,5

It's ok .. same as normal.. just different characters 😂,5

Boring don't install this game starting is good next level chapter 26 stop and final then you pay and this game is you do not install,1
Downloading is slow besides that it's an okay game,3
New game and also very good story for me 12 boy,4
Fun but it is a bit pricey,3
"Very fun game, reminds of WARCRAFT!",5
"Good game , but timing system is very boring 😅😅",3
The best mobile RTS game I've played!,5
Download this game from mistplay and ended up really liking it.,5
Very nice game every person before die should play this,4
Good game like most village building games,4
"this game is full of lots to do, never a dull moment",5
Pretty fun so far. I hope this doesn't turn out to be clan based,4
THIS GAME IS ADDICTING AWESOME GREAT AND FUN ITS JUST THE BEST DOWNLOAD IT,5
Fun and makes me feel strong and brawed,5
Good game even though experience points froze,5
"Good game, keeps me busy.",5
"I do really enjoy the game so far but I can't stand these cowardly, higher level players attacking me and causing catastrophic damage to my city and troops. I wish there was a way to opt out of PVP because I'd enjoy the game a lot more without it.",4
"This is a game ive been looking for a long time .As a f2p ,this game is excellent, opportunity is available to grow and meet p.eople from all over. The Graphics are pretty good so far ,translation into English is better than most ,overall, great game,.developers seem to be better than most as far as ""greed"" VIKINGS RISE "" ..give it a try ..server 5,look for the pinch. 4* guys",3
Interesting so far but starting to slow down and pushing a couple cheap micro transactions,4
Its a great game but as it's so big it's glitchy all the time which is quite annoying,4
"Really good game, But it takes a while to understand and patience is needed for this.",3
It is a good game the story is good and it is entertaining,5
I like this game it gives you clear tips on what to do,5
It's a pretty cool it's not like the other build your empire apps out there it keeps you nice and entertained,5
"Great game , the best game I played.but there is just one problem is with the arabic typing, we hope that you fix it",5
Worst interface. It shows no internet connection while my phone is connected to 500mbps speed net.,2
"Fix your recent update, the game lags horribly and also at times it crashes. And it's not just with me but everyone in the server.",3
"I'm giving *** only cuz of well designed audiovisuals. Can't tell anything else about the game because whenever I'm being forced to play dumb, unskipable turtorials = uninstall.",3
I'm still new to these types of games but iv played a bunch of others and this one is my favorite by far. great graphics. plenty to do while waiting for buildings and troops. tons of events to play. it lagged a few times but not that bad just restarted my app and was good. I'm addicted lol,5
"Not really the same game showed in the advert, but glad it isn't. Pretty good",5
Microtransaction bs copypaste game. Nothing original. Poor engine and hard monetization.,1
"Very fun, quite addictive, and well designed. Keep it up.",5
"Edit review. It is a decent game, but wayyyyyyyyyy to much to do and way to much area to cover and build on. Cut down areas to cover and it would be a great game. Also, need a better way to level up cheifs and warriors.",2
Players spend a lot of money and easily own everything that's nonsense!,1
This game is getting crash every once in a while. This sucks the most.,1
Wonderful super addictive game. But let me now came to point out some issues so you'll make the game more amazing and better... 1. It's lagging improve on Maximum fps 2. Tribe searching filters needed(please add it as fast as possible) 3. Give rewards for the top players ( it'll increase competition to grind faster so it means they'll buy in shop means profit for you guys) 4. Need some Wars among Clans to fire up the kingdom...then later kingdom vs kingdoms That's all please work on it....,4
Game developers of games like clash of clans and clash royale should learn from you people.... Games by them are pay to win type of games,4
"It's really well made game, fun and addicting. It's been a while since a game caught my time",5
Great game. Laggs some. Wish the was a off line verson to where your not attached 15 time in a day. Done with this,2
"New to this Game and still finding my way, but so far seems good. Getting more involved now and slightly more thought required.",4
"So far, thia game seems awesome. Coold graphics and easy to play with.",5
The endgame is boring. Few events and a lot of time to do research (17+ days),3
It's fun but it doesn't load and even after putting several tickets into customer service I get told the same thing and I've done it more than 7 times and it still doesn't work. FIX YOUR BUGS,2
"This game is really amazing, this is the one what I need",5
Good game. Liking it so far. No lag like some reviews suggested. I do wish resources replenished somehow though.,4
Its good but kinda hard to understand all whats happening in the progress also the thing bother me if i don't continue to play,5
"Don't bother, this game does load on WiFi network will only work using your phone data.",1
I LOVED IT WHEN I STARTED PLAYING I GOT ADDICTED,5
Good graphics and like the story.,4
Nice game but a bit slow there & there,4
"Gameplay is excellent in my opinion easy to navigate controls, would have gave 5 stars but so far I haven't really noticed or seen any type of events or things of that sort to earn gems instead of having to buy them.. actually haven't seen a way to buy em unless I'm missing something...and the fact you have to start off paying 200 gems to refresh where you hire workers after the first 3 to 5 times can't remember how many free times it offers.",4
"Was really enjoying this game until I got attacked for no reason over and over again. So this is just one of those terrible games where people 20 levels above you can attack you and ruin the experience. Why ruin a perfectly good game with that awful ""overworld"" mechanic.",1
Just started game will see after play longer.,4
very good graphic but use a lot of energy and alot of lags there's no Arabic language and no resources fabrics,4
This game is absolutely awesome!!!! 10 out of 10,5
Good game so far easy to play,4
Horrible and boring I hated it!! Deleted after one minute!!! These mobile games are really bad!!!,1
Love the game so far. Biggest complaint is a lack of a way to move to a different server.,4
This game is really good Nice graphics I would give a 5 stars but it crashes time to time,4
I actually enjoy this game and i love the way you progress your base and move forward along the battlefiel,5
This game is enjoyable and more should play it because you might like it depending on if you like survival games,5
"So far so good. Pacing seems decent, better than most. Need more time to be sure it's a keeper though.",5
So far easy to learn and pick up but enough to keep you interested,5
It's relaxing and easy to understand. Something to play to pass time when you can't sleep.,5
"Fun game, sometimes have to just guess what you are meant to do but enjoyable.",4
"For the first time a game is better then is shown in the ads Man you should see the grahpics the game play,everything deserves a 5 star in this game",5
I did love the game ... Untill the Devs let big spenders cheat by using farming bots . Iv even sent screen shots to the Admin of a clan in our Kingdome using the farming bots and the Devs still do nothing. But it's funny how everytime they do nothing it's always the big spenders that get away with cheating,1
"Great game, the ads are actual gamplay and I enjoy it very much.",5
Game is built like that it will only favour the top tribe in pier access new comers don't have the same chance.,4
The Graphics and game play so amazing... I like this kind of game old but gold...,5
TBH this is pretty good because there is no ads and it feels so amazing when you kill a boss,4
This game is very immersive and fun and easy play never had problems with ads,5
"I would enjoy the game more if actually got my rewards I earned from tapjoy , but it just doesn't pay.",4
"Another building game, nothing like it's add shows. Plus it's focused around pagan gods",1
No real explanations on how to get new soldiers/vikings...no real instruction....point and click game realky,3
Cool action and village growth/troops etc. Sometimes hangs up on moving forward or speedups.,4
I played to chapter 10 logged back on and my game reset. Waste of time.,1
"I love this game. I got it today, and it's really fun. It so.e times langs but that's because of my storage or WiFi. I love this so much",4
"This is much more different from the ad its much better than I thought, now Im quite addicted to the game",5
Nice story. Excellent graphics. AND NO ADS!!! OMG L9VE IT.,5
Always have big respect for IGG game for the high quality game they provide ! But this one has so many bug ! That I believe the original manager not working there anymore lol lol lol ???,3
The game Needs to let us have more troops in battle because I have heaps of troops and I can't use all of them,2
Good tho but I think you need to upgrade it so that players can make their own designs,5
Love the game so far just started but i can't play much coz it keeps freezing on me need fixing,4
"Laggy blocking ui tutorial overlay, which sometimes is not clickable and game progress stuck",1
I was playing and out of nowhere it closed the app out and then I had to restart from the very beginning,1
You get to build your city level your troops. The way you want. It pick your own allegiances joining a tribe start your own tribe. It gives you hundreds and hundreds of things you can do. I told this game to my wife and now she's addicted. To plan it plate it 8 and a 1/2 hours straight.,5
"For now I'll give the game 4*, I only started a day ago so I haven't played long enough to see and learn everything but so far it's a great game.",4
"So far I am thoroughly liking this game. As a newbie, I am still figuring things out. I like that there is always something to do. This is definitely not a boring game. :)",5
It's so fun the second I started playing I was right in the action I would definitely recommend this game to all who like viking games,5
"Really enjoing this game so far, very good graphics and easy to play and understand",5
"Great game , fast progress , just a bit of a buffer other than that I love this game !",4
I like that you give as exact gameplay which you show as in ad Only you increase graphic in ad Not in game Overall good game 🎮 And catchy game 🥰,4
Good game wish there was more control real life aspects be nice if the gameplay was like age of empires,5
Very good graphics. Easy to play. In less words this game is lit,5
Love this game download it been on it all day the adventure get more fun evertime and I fell like a general tell everyone what to do it's a 5star,5
"Its a good game really, but them graphics should be a little more clear i think",4
Super good and addicting open world cool storyline and overall the real deal not the clickbait adds it's fr good,5
Definitely not what I imagined when I saw their short video clip......it's just another strategic game,3
"Only started playing but seems fun,and so far story line seems interesting.",4
In all I just like this game I like how u have to progress and it's not pay to win and how u actually get to fight things.,5
It's a nice game I have not seen anything wrong with it yet but if there is I would let you guys know. The image quality is also nice,3
Please bring the Hero Mount feature as soon as possible. I have been waiting for it for a Long time,4
My old phone can't handle it too well but it looks nice and seems fun.,4
"It's nice to try this game, nostalgic game when i was child, nice graphic, better game play, good job",5
"please don't waste your time and money, it's the biggest cash grab game I mean even the advert is fake. Calling this pay to win is an understatement you are forced even by the community to pay after you've invested time into a game you can't win because people don't just die. If you like people making fake alliances, are incredibly xenophobic and judging you by the amount you're willing to spend then this game is for you.",1
I thought that the ad was lying. I'm in shock how good and really fun this game is.,5
It's a very good game.it's graphics are good when I touch the worker he was dancing looking soo funny 😁,5
probably one of the first games of this genre I've been able to sit down and play for longer than a week. thank you for making a fun game,5
Its a really fun game. Especially if you like to build and create your own civilization.,4
My only beef so far is just how small everything is. Makes it tricky to navigate.,4
I love this game. I remember the age of empires.and good story all so love your hard work thanks 😍,5
Need to teach the Technics for the players in some time it feels some problem and it's lagging,4
"Cant open the app after days of playing, uninstalled it and install again but still wont open.",2
"Can you fix the update, Mercinary guild has issues for many players, we can't hired troops in it... We are hoping you fix asap, thank you",5
Login has expired.. Quite a bad game when you can not start it up first time.,1
"Fun and entertaining; Good job! By the way, if possible... Please make more Viking Warriors to summon!",5
Boring. There is no any new mechanics in this game. Devs just added skin to standard engine.,1
Took a minute to get use to but as im getting the hang of things its starting to pay off.,5
Every single time it stucks and delays even though there is a smooth internet connection,1
I love it is challenging without being to difficult to interact with.,5
This game is very lovely very intriguing but the monster are more powerful than you he Kill you many time,5
it keeps crashing all of a sudden ! it is getting super annoying,3
"The game is good, but there is no Ukranian language, please add it because I do not understand English",1
This Game is awful you grind and grind but your always vulnerable to paying players that are 10 times stronger than how do you expect new players to improve,1
So far I have no been able to put it down 5 hours have went by and I didn't even realize it. Love it. I'll let you know if that changes.,5
Fun so far but will someone please make a game with no in game purchases it defeats the purpose of playing for fun and having skill not money,4
Don't know why but the game is not working properly it is directly closed while playing it. 🤔,2
Love it! I hope i can get more rewards from the hard working devs and the whole guys! 💖😘,5
Old design but still good when you want to waste your precious time,3
"This game really intresting... but some time, i got lagg... hopefully can fixed by development...",4
"Cant read the words!! They're way to small, hard on the eyes! Bye bye",1
Very good game only problem is a little laggy if that's fixed 10/10 game.,4
"Way better than rise of kingdoms. No ads, just like the ads amazing 🤩🤩🤩",5
"It's kind of difficult to figure out how to play the game when you first start to play, but then it gets easier.",4
"The game story is interesting, and the graphics are good. The building details are very good. So far, so good. Nothing new.",1
Very nice gameplay with excellent graphics and storyline.,5
"Perfect, besides the immensely slow take off to the story & plot.",4
So far I like it. Let me keep going. Can't put phone down. Love the experience of the game so far.,5
Like other games of this kind. Artwork is good. Story line is good,4
"Good game, when you can play it. Game crashed and now i cant log back in",2
Better than most. It isn't begging you to join a group every 4 seconds. And I've yet to see an ad.,5
Please add more fighting strategical features to the fighting e g art of war pvp fighting styles make the fighting styles more real,2
It is a quite good simple simulation game it teaches you how do vikings live and how to train your life,5
"One of the amazing games, the graphics are exceptional👌. I really love the game",5
"Very Super Game! It fantasy game.. If they update the game very well, it will be super....",5
Thought it would be hard and boring but wow really fun and addicting !!!!,5
Enjoying this game a lot. Just starting but there's plenty of in game help. So far it's pretty fun.,5
"I was not expecting to get this sucked into the game, but it's strangely addictive... I can't put it down now!!!",5
On what items could we all Viking Rise player able to use gold? And this game is awesome 🥰🥰.,5
Awesome 👌 this game is great the viking lore is spot on and the art style makes it.,5
This game is so fun it is better then clash of clans nothing about it is bad 💯 I rate it 5 stars download it now I mean it.,5
I love it you can gather resources and upgrade your villagers I could play it all day.,5
Its a nice allows you to use your mind but at certain stage the troops powerful that yours and destroy your troop,5
It's the super good and interesting I would recommend playing it if you like adventure and fighting,5
It is starting out ok not sure if I will keep playing but hay it is a time consuming process,3
"Quite a good game, neat display, gameplay is perfect.",4
"I have seen this games ads and I was not impressed but after playing it, I take that back it's so good....🤐",5
"So far, so good. It is a little different than other games and that makes it challenging.",5
Really cool but the problem is that it takes too long for the to start plz fixe that,4
Fun and makes you think about putting your buildings in the best place for the town,5
A good game to play if someone wants to kill the time. Graphics are nice,4
Typical building a town game with a viking theme. Like it for the theme.,4
Very much nice graphics science I am thinking the screen shot are fake but no man it's really good👍👍👍👍,5
Your game is good but you need to improve graphics and slightly large alphabets size,4
It is survived game this concept was so good and it's graphics also super.,5
Only played for a few hours seems pretty good so far. But I can tell this is going to move to a paid to win. I'll update.,5
"Pay to win, extremely glitchy mechanics. In desperate need of balancing.",1
Surprisingly entertaining. Good graphics and gameplay.,5
Ok farming game. Looks nothing like the popup advert that brought me to the game.,4
I don't play games where some jerk who has spent money to build can attack others that are 10% of his strength. Uninstalling now. Will be sure to mention this game in my blog.,1
Actually enjoy this game when I have the time. It's a chill game and I haven't really experienced any issues,4
"Excellent game! If you have the option to play this OFFLINE, that will be better😍😍",5
Great story line. Easy to play. Simply love this game!,4
Doing this on my phone. Words are very small. So cannot spend a lot of time due to eye fatigue.,3
"Ok, but white writing is a bit unclear to read a bit bigger as well, time and date",5
"I was surprised I thought this game would be very good, but very quickly I changed my opinion. After that I couldn't stop playing.",5
Its really a nyc relaxing game. Its a kinda even classy. Big up to the developers..👍👍,4
gameplay is amazing and the quest are good plus the graphics is excellent kudos to dev,5
So far im liking the game. Good tutorial for learning and fun playing.,4
"Interesting, great missions , good graphics and gameplay",4
this game is so great awesome graphics ive been playing this for 7 hours i love i can't stop playing this,5
Just started playing a little laggy at the start but I have no issue with the game I like it,3
I've played many games in this genre and this by far the most fun game I've ever played. Loving it so far!,5
Tha graphics are really good and the overall quality is very good 👍,4
When I start playing a game every time screen blankout and close very bad 😞,1
"I don't typically like games like this, but this one's really cool. It's only getting four stars because of the way it's set up, I don't know how to explain it. I recommend it",4
"A lot of toxic players who keep harassing player on a lower level than them, please make an option to block them and prevent them from interacting with u",3
"It's the best game, it's like colonising everything kinda feel like I'm taking over.",5
This game for good this game warry simple and easy to play but some time bugs are coming,5
Good design and complexity to keep you interested.,5
Great game got so many potential need to improve graphic quality and gameplay tho,5
Not a bad game very time consuming and nothing like the game advert,3
Can improve upgrading bit fast & waiting for a quite some time untill upgrade makes annoying,4
It's a really fun game hard to be a tribe leader but really fun to play,5
Amazing game but when I was loading it in it inverted the color and now it works fine I love this game,4
Seems pretty fun but its not the best at explaining where to go from the tutorial,4
Only one problem for not giveing 5 star is it takes loading time if can change it this game is lit,4
"Fun at first, but pay to win. Larger players will beat on you otherwise. Wasted a week of my life...",1
Just like any other game similar to this. Build lvl up destroy and get conquered by someone stronger 🤷🏻‍♂️,3
"Finally, the perfect game! Thanks for making an ol' geezer happy.",5
"till now is nice game , i like when the caracther real sound speak , the graphics still average",4
They will do literally nothing about illegal bot farms. Do not buy rss in game just go through the 3rd parties since they don't care to do anything :) you can jump 80mil in power through bot farms for less than 200 dollars and even if you get reported 5 times they don't care and won't do a thing :) also if you're not ready to spend money do not download :),1
It's fun and I discover many things also there are no ads.,5
Awesome graphics different style gameplay than other games I've played 😍 it!!,5
The game is perfect.. Just add the arabic language as soon as possible please,4
This gaming experience is one of the best I have ever played. Especially this type.... Thank you!!!!,5
Just started playing. So far ita fun and easy to grasp. Worth playing.,4
Horrible game because after every upgrade you need to wait so much and very bad experience,1
"This is a great game, but it's so hard to get a new hero for free, because I'm always play for free.",5
This game is pretty fun. The only problem is it lags to much 4 me,3
This game is awesome they got a lot of the characters from the show but I want Buren I haven't seen him on here,5
It is a cool place but there is one problem when you are playing it freezes,4
"I like the game, graphics are good and it has a good layout.",5
Great game.. Everything is oerfect from story line to graphics.,5
It's like... I dunno but FUN to play SUPER SUPER FUN l can never get board with it,5
It's very good and so interesting but it is little harder for beginners 😛,4
"Fun, takes a bit to catch on. Good coaching.",5
Amazing game and the graphics are incredible.,5
Good game but sometimes I can't move the screen. Please fix this 😊,4
"Rated with 5 stars earlier, Getting issues in completing commissions, can't complete commissions....",4
I enjoy it... Even i dnt know how to play but still i enjoy and so far i can manage thu... 😀😀😀,5
"After the update the game is not even starting, facing the same issue since past few days",1
Game graphics is good but your team can make it more smoother please look in it😃,5
Graphics are awesome. The game is easy going.,5
DISCLAMER!! FALSE ADVERTIZING. What do you see in a adds? A free build? Nope. All you get is survival,1
One of the best user experience The game is smooth and the graphics are the best,5
Don't like in-game purchases Free to play doesn't work if players that do pay clear you out every chance they have .you can't grow then,1
So far pretty cool! No ads and lots of fun!,4
"Very tempting, timing is reasonable and no ads!!",5
Nice game. Understandable. Eagerly waiting to unlock more. Thank you dev,5
This game is awesome it's like empire earth but I can't own empire earth but I find this game and having lot of fun,3
So relaxing and enjoyable like you are travel back in time.,5
its fun. It looks very p2w though so will see when I get stuck as f2p,4
its a good game but it dosent teach you anything at all i love it in all but its not perfect its good.,5
So far enjoying it but it seems like your standard upgrade/train farm and war game,5
"Great game so far, it has a bit of lagging in it. But alot better than most games I've played.",4
It's just like the ad. I love it. Its what I play at 3 am.,5
Really good it's not boring and it's just like in the ad,4
Nice game but games is lags... But I'm injoying dis game I lov it... I request dis Viking do u confirm I wanna play and offline because to be a great time with my self,3
"Easy play, great music and graphics.",5
Great little base building game with viking theme I would recommend it!!!,4
"If we had some control buttons to attack, it would be great.",4
This game is full of cruelty and animals are shown in a killing action this can lead to cruelty in people 's mind . I gave 1 star for good editing skills . I think you may understand at the end I can't bare this incentive of animal cruelty.,1
Didn't think I would enjoy a game like this but I guess I do bc I've been playing for about 3 hours straight and didn't even realize it!☺️,5
This is a very very good game I love it it's not hardgo and it's just amazing I hope they make more games like this one I'll diff play it,5
The game is so exciting and easy to play Ive playing for 8 h straight you should try it too,5
Awesome game fun and not hard to level up and keep on gaming and progressing,5
Music and culture.... And more important like good story and Characters,5
Good start little bit vague in guide but easy enough to work out what to do,4
Very good game! But the detains are not the same as the ads,4
Good game but it takes literal weeks irl to complete research and construction projects. Only to be raided while you're asleep or at work. Costs millions of rss to heal the damage. Hopefully your king has some wisdom otherwise you just want to quit because it's all for nothing anyway.,3
Pretty fun game. Great graphics and a nice storyline,5
"So far, the game is above average. I have had a bad experience with IGG in the past. However that was about 4 years ago so I'm giving them another chance.",3
It's really fun but I want it not to rain and snow or night for long id like it day in spring,4
"Extremely fun and high quality game, haven't been playing long and already addicted",4
Very nice game really enjoyed it the deveploers really makes a nice games this games experiences us relastic vikings war and also startergy loved it,5
So far I'm near the game but the game is fun and exciting and a lot of futures and they're keeping me going into it,4
"Nice timekiller, they give you a lot of speed ups to get you going.",4
"Fantastic game. And super immersive, even if you don't pay",5
Basic And Very Interesting Not Hard To Get The Hang Of Like Other Games That Don't Explain Much.,5
Great little game no ads popping up every 2min graphics are amazing .....,5
Nice game but the construction and development of army time is very slow,5
"What's wrong with this game ? After the update, for doing one thing, it's taking a lot of loading for no reason !? Why ?",1
Addiction at it's finest! I could not stop playing! I just wonder how this game is free...,5
It lags a lot of time amd stops automatically shutdown,3
Very nice game. Hope this game will have updates to have a specific clan to choose to make it more interresting,5
This is like a version of those simulation games but for guys! I LOVE IT!!!!!!!,5
"Fun so far, good instructions and not too many ads",4
Cool game so far. Good storyline and easy to learn.,5
It is a good game. But there's always room for improvement. I can't wait to see the new updates.,4
"Excellent, but, complicated. Too much stuff to deal with.",5
Stop show purchase details in the screen... 🙏😶 .. its irritating But still game is fun,3
"Game is good,Some improvement is needed in controls.",3
So far the game is fun. I'll see how far I get and if it becomes too much pay to play and win,4
"It is better version of rise of kingdoms, fun game for war and strategy",5
"For parts are good, we should have more to do than just upgrade",3
The graphic are great and so is the story line so far.,5
Love this game. It keeps me up all night playing some times and keep me entertained,5
"Takes some time to understand how it all works, but a change to my usual game.",4
I like this tipe of open world games and the game was to good graphics .,2
I love the texture and the explorering the game does it has many cool theems,5
So far so good. Love the storyline and the characters. Can't wait to see what happens next.,5
Great game so far I really like the viking theme easy game play and a wee bit addictive,5
So far it's pretty cool it would be nicer if you consume anymore or just have bigger characters 😁🤠,5
I just love it ....this is the first game I'm actually enjoying ✨✨🤌🏻🤌🏻 I will recommend to everyone Plzz download it and play it for yourself and see how beautiful and amazing this game is ....💜💜,4
The game is veryyyy goddddd but there is only one problem is to gives us a tutorial in video,5
"For now 5 stars from me. I just star to play, meybe 1 and half hour ago. And it seems it's a rly nice game. I hope it would stay like this. :)",5
"Interesting, and easy follow along tactical support.",5
So fun and never stops like when I thought I beat the whole game and there was much more to it,5
Waste of time.. Cant login in account from Google or fb.. without login can't play game..,1
It's cool that you can but one thing is it takes a while build.,4
"Its a wonderful game, it is similar to the ad shown...",5
Just another pay to win mobile game with minimal content on trashy servers. DON'T BOTHER.,1
Just started so don't know about gameplay but graphics looks great,5
Very good game. I like these kind of games where you have to build your own settlement,5
I love the game the graphics are fantastic too keep it up,5
"Ok so far, few hrs in,research to long at start , may get better, not rss are a problem at start",3
This game working on data but I download it it not working it take tooo long too open but it not open 😟😟,1
"Fun. Not too challenging, relaxing gameplay.",5
Very good game and enjoying game graphics is soO good never seen these graphics,5
"Too many cheaters and bot users on this game, don't waste your time playing, the dev don't care about the rulebreakers, they just want your money. I will only change review once they ban those rulebreakers.",1
Most beautiful game I ever seen very mice graphis and maps thanks for this wonderful game 🎮 😀,5
Like the ads. Kinda..... but really really fun,5
Awesome game decent graphics and the story is pretty good I would recommend,4
It is awesome you can upgrade if you want to an attack a Niflung base,5
Really great game Better than all Trading games that follow a typical strategy for just sell their products. But I really enjoyed it Tnx for creators❤️🥊,5
It's easy to play but still exploring it into detail,5
When i open the task or click something it freezes for like microseconds,4
"Good enough, graphic op. Little bit complicated but okkkk",4
The graphics and game play are flawless. Kept me on my toes. Its a good game.,5
IGG why did you choose to make your beautiful game a paradise for hackers and resource sellers? Does it improve your business to make players who could have spent money on the game to instead give hackers money to design mining bots for them or buy resources from sellers? You have spent 3 months saying you are working on it but nothing ever changes. Most of the powerful players use bot miners or buy resources from others. Why are you hurting your own brand and game so badly?,4
Jus a few glitches that needs to be fixed but it's a great game,4
Very cool game graphics are awesome and story is good.,5
Great gameplay experience! Plenty of various events.,5
Great game! Love the graphics and the music.,5
Cool game took a minute for this og to catch on but getting the hang of it.,5
My experience was amazing 🤩🤩🤩. I had a lot of troops to fight monsters,5
"Good game play but exspensive passed level 20 , hope you have endless money to waste",1
This gam is so fun and help me relieve my stress and thanks for making this game all of your hard d work,5
Game play is easy Graphics is very good I like it.,4
Very nice game i very like but one thing is i did not understand this game mechanism that what we have to do ? Well i will understand slowly while playing thi game,4
Kind of laggy but fun to level up and rewards are good so far,3
"Overall fun experience, fun game and all. Love the game. Fyi Please add claim all items to the game to improve everyone game experience",5
I seen some warriors running mistake I don't have any complain this game is pretty good and nice story line 👏,4
Most interesting game and very fun. No words to describe how good this game is.,5
Very fun game but some of it takes long but it is a very fun game,4
Very addictive! Lol I love it!,5
It's a fun game I have not found a single problem with the game so far it's just a nice game!,4
Finally a game I can really enjoy. Relaxing fun after work. Definitely recommend,5
I made it a five star because the game is good also it gives us fun and strategy quest which is my favorite,5
I'm enjoying the game so far. I haven't been playing long enough to give a full review but I like it so far.,4
Nice game ..but it will be better if can see the village in food mode,3
"Pretty good game, no issues and graphics are nice",5
It is good experience for me. Graphic is master piece.,4
The battle experience can get boring after doing it again and again,3
Fun please join lots to do will keep you busy easy to learn,5
"Enjoying the tutorial help on the game, keep it up.",4
This game is awesome. I love the game play. It doesn't take long to level up.,5
It is a great game. Keep up the work. But if I didn't have problems I would have given 5 stars.the reason is that the game randomly crache . So please fix it I'd hate to delete it. Over all great game,5
this game shoold be named clame and upgrade not viking where is the fight ? where is the strategy on battle ? its all about troop numbers. all i have been doing since a week is just claiming rewards and upgrading. with silly fight style which goes all automatic all you have to do is watch till you lose or win no tactics nothing.sorry devs its just a wast of this good graphic work,1
this is a very interesting game! it has no ads and its my neew favorite game!,5
Very interesting game play with good graphics.,5
"game it self is not bad, however in couple of hours of not playing a game ,some member steal my clan and demote me ,hours of hard work ,good thing i did not invest any money as would then be huge issue. Fix whatever vote system you have that other players can not steal or take over your hard work clan or a tribe when you are afk. I do not intend to be playing this game 24h/7 to prevent something like that.In nut shell any body with a friend can take over your clan and take away. When offline",1
Game is quite good but the offer popups are annoying.,4
"5he graphics a good, and I like the single olayer missions",5
Many of these City Builders are quite obviously building off the old school 'Settlers' vibe. Viking Rise has brought in Gacha mechanics from games such as Azur Lane and Genshin Impact. So far I've been able to get along quite well without any abhorrent P2W mechanics. However only time will tell if I reach a brick wall and the only way to continue is via my wallet. The game gets 4 stars from me with the possibility of getting 5 after the next week of play depending on monitisation,4
This is a lot of fun and I love the battles and voice acting👍.,4
"In my opinion it is a fun game but, it is all a matter of taste.",4
Why is the game not like the advert Twice now I have lost all progress starting to not like game,2
So far the game is good. I like the mechanics of the game. I like the story line and all. I like that it has a lot of stuff that can be done. So overall I like it. It a Challenge and I like Challenge.,5
Would like to see more features which take time to complete and can be done for free. Aside from that it's a good game in terms of Empire Building fueled by pay to win.,5
"Loving the challenge, aptitude building at the right pace.",5
Progress way to slow. Fun while it lasted,2
Best game the graphics are good and adventure are also,5
"The ads online do not at all represent the gameplay style. Basically all you do is buy units or upgrades then click attack. No strategy, discovery, adventure etc",2
This is a really interesting game. I love it!,5
It is a very real VFX game and improve our graphics card,5
I LIKE THIS GAME IT'S FUN TO PLAY I RECOMMEND,4
Fun game lots to do keep you busy and entertaining,4
"This game is awesome,I love viking games and this one is the best one i have played so far,keep it up,much love and thank you.",5
Really good. Still has a few glitches but it keeps getting better,5
"A good strategy game, but it lacks the Arabic language",5
"The game is very good, I hope you will make a good update",5
So far it is fun the tutorial isnt mind numbing which is good.,4
"Great game, complex and fun. This is the best strategy game so far, the game is awesome !! Edit: after 1 month playing, I have to say this is the next big thing, the game has different aspect of playing and it's always challenging and fun to developing. The Tribe is what is the most important and I love how easy it is to move troops around ! Great game guys !! I really love this master piece",5
"Good game, nice graphic with great storylines. 👍",5
It's fine but I want a little more backstory like a hidden story of why the game was made,4
BEST GAME EVER NO NEED TO TALK JUST TRY THE GAME YOU'LL NOT REGRET IT,5
Fun Viking game. Keeps u busy building and makeing ur village better.,5
"I love this game so much and I really like the character looks but maybe don't have so much wood but I know it is for making the houses and the village but for the guy that said"" this game has sever lag and the connection is not working."" Maybe get a new phone and not a flip phone and maybe get a job to pay your wifi bill and maybe it would work. -Nevaeh Sarik.",5
"Nice game great graphics, but the coins isn't enough",4
Story is assume Graphic is very good,3
"I didn't have high hopes for this and man was I wrong, this is actually a very well put together game and even though its not exactly like the advertisements, its still really good quality, My only nitpick is this kind of game is really overused, the combat is identical to rise of kingdoms but overall I love this game",4
Fun fast and funny,4
It's fun. It's similar to the zombie survival game. I enjoy it.,5
So far no pvp which is a good thing sometimes its just a nice change to have game you can just chill and play the graphics are decent the seasons change as you play nice campaign playthrough. Update: there's PvP the joys of getting attacked all the time yay but still a decent game bar the PvP for me.,4
So far so good cos just starting thru the game,4
"This game is amazing i just started and being a bit experience with games such as COC it's so fun and the unlocking other villages is awesome,but i had a small problem that the wood does not appear near the base it comes in challenge more pls add a bit more of wood source/trees to help starting after cheif hall 2",4
I relly like the game it doesnt need to look like în the ads to be fun,5
Very hard to get the hang of things at the start alot of things to take in and community is o.k judge for yourself but mad graphics and story,4
"Nice game n alot to do its keep u want to keep played n easy to manage just follow things to do on events, daily quests, n etc. Anyway feels tiring after played few days n get bored too coz so much to do even hw nice the game is. Its still not captured my interest to stay playing, so I will quit game. I wish this game is like the pc game more to it n really solo playing with npc to fight. Not really likes games need club/clan/tribe/guild/or whatever to get involve with it too tiring at last.",4
The game is awesome and fun to play,5
"Games okay over all but it's not like I was hoping, thought it would be more of an RPG style game",3
"Nice game play, graphic are well done. Good game.",5
Awesome great game to play with out a dought,5
It's a wonderful game and you can make money off of it if you have mistplay I love this game,5
I like keeping gameplay a little more simpler.Not bad so far.,4
"Text is small on mobile, But biggest problem if playing f2p you can compete but you are looking at 6-8 Hours grinding aday. I'm not willing to spend that much time on a game. And no one should spend either money or time just for numbers on a screen. Lmao players egos when they got might 20 times yes 40m cash players hitting 2m very active players. It's egos of players that spoil the game. There's been balanced solutions for game's like this for years. But egos spend big and keep spending.",3
"Not bad. Tutorial could use some work and the UI could be a bit clearer and utilize sidebars and menus more, but pretty fun. Definitely could use some more in depth descriptions on how to use some items.",4
"This us actually pretty fun, especially with the no ads part",5
Is really fun and entertaining whoever the developer is. They did a good job,5
It is good but not like it's ad that is shown,5
State of survival style. Don't like it,3
Its nice the graphic is beautiful! its a great game.,4
"Really cool game, wish it was more open world but it's pretty good.",4
The game is very enjoyable lot's to do and you don't have to spend money.,5
Brilliant game a must play,5
"Servers are so bad the game is just a waste of space on phone, stick it",1
"It is very good game.Battle style ,buildings and other things is superb but why I give 4 star out of 5 because it take to much time load the game and some times showing a network error but my network connection is good . That's why I give four stars .",4
This game ancient geography is very likeble to me and everything else is also My English is little inconvenience so forvime me bye,5
The graphics are really good and the game play is really good too.,5
Game too slow and the least amount of speedups ever.,1
"i enjoy the game so much, but eventually the screen gets covered in buttons and notifications you cant get rid of the chat that keeps moving and it takes up the whole bottom part idk, im autistic and there was eventually just too many instructions at once",2
"This is a top game! Deserving of more than 5 stars rating. Excellent gameplay, balance, regeneration, progression and above all else, it's fun and addictive in all the best ways.",5
"Pay to win, some ""quests"" literaly tell you to cash out 5.99 lol, also it is just a iteration number 1892 of the same build build build game and therefore except graphics there is nothing new in this game compared to other ""similar quality games"" 🤣would not recomend. Also my 2 weeks are ruined.",1
I enjoyed while I did play it but it was overwhelmingly laggy more than likely due to my phone type and how old it is. But I would definitely play again one day if I ever get a better mobile device or my PC back.,5
"Its not playing when you are told where to push and have to watch the animations, it's more like a cartoon and it's also a disgrace culturally and historically but that's not important if it's fun.. This is just sad",1
"The game is good, more than good. It's amazing. Fighting in an old time and fighting to be the best 👌 amazing and u get to play with other people , oh my lord ,new friends or enemies that's great 👍",5
"Everything is fine but it loading sucks ,makes phone go for again and again , it won't happen when I play heavy graphics game than this , just recently after the update game's all glitch and freeze",3
"Played for 5 min then uninstall. Lol just keep tapping and game will move forward .U can't choose location , can't choose anything boring",1
This is incredible game graphics =100 story = 100 and everything is 💯,5
Early right now but very entertaining,3
Intresting Game very well organies. keep up the good work.,5
"Doesn't let you save data when paired with another device!. Just got a new phone and transferred all the data across , the problem is now my old phone has my data of the game where as the new phone brings me to a brand new game 😟. I suggest an idea of connecting it through Facebook or an account that would save the current data the account is registered to so other players don't have to restart while getting another phone.",3
I don't like those stuff on the bar they telling u to buy a jewellery or soliders please at least put so i press it to delete from bar,3
"Hi, I'm trying to update the game but does not work, it downloads ok and goes through the motion of installing but as soon as it finished installing it gives a error saying can not install, I have tried taking off some apps incase it's a memory issue but still does not work, I only have one other game on tablet so can see any other reason for it not working. This is a great came and the graphics are fab, if I can not update it then it will have to be uninstalled as will not let play.",5
"So much fun. Don't have to have sound, good for kids too",5
The game lags and freezes but not a bad game,2
I enjoy this game but its lagging in my phone so just play it sometimes. Honestly i recomend this game its so fun and enjoyable game,4
nice mechanics and visuals and easy to play so far,5
"Good Game , Awesome Graphics, Awesome Motions and characters 🔥😎😘",5
Its a very realistic and cool game keep up the good work,4
Easy and fun,5
I really enjoy the game especially with vikings in it keep up the great work 🙂⚔️🛡️,5
Everything was great until the stupid chat bar showed up!!! HOW ON EARTH CAN I DISABLE THE STUPID CHAT BAR ???,1
This is the first game of this type I have ever enjoyed. The game helps you know what to do which makes it really fun!,5
"Game is amazing. It looks like 2 other games but for me, it surpasses them. To the devs: Game is great, by far your best game. Pls work and invest in the quests, farm and lore around the city. It keeps us occupied and the lore is nice. Mindless grinding outside the city isnt that fun, unless you add more stuff. Ps - I saw u have 1 game in steam with mixed reviews. Consider adding: Viking Rise. I am sure people will be glad to play it cross platform ^^",5
GUI is kinda wonky. Spent a lot of time working on graphics for the story line I usually skip through. Would rather have the ability to move buildings after construction. Disappointed there's no female avatar option to start with.,3
"I expected more from igg but i was disappointed, the LORDS MOBILE game is better than this game i hope some changes will occur truly iam saying that i don't like this game as much as lords mobile",3
"What a fun game! When it isn't so laggy that a 30 SECOND task takes almost 20 MINUTES! Since this indicates a complete lack of interest in dev/supporting their own business and a complete lack of regard for their customers, this company will NEVER get ANY of my money.",1
"enjoying the game, good graphics and enjoying developing my village",5
"I have been trying to install this game and seem too slow to load it up, no matter how I tried it. I really doubt whether this game requires lots of capacity that make it take so long for installation. After an hours of failure installation, it totally kills my interest to keep going and I decided to gave up.",1
This is a very nice game I liked this game very much you can play this game,5
So the game so far is quite complicated. But it is amazing. The effort they have put into this game is awsome. They even have a builder called jamal. So of course I'm going to keep playing this is an awsome game and reminds me of the old strategy game I would 100% recommend this,5
Good strategy game with story attached,5
Nice game I hope this game make progress like crazy,5
is gun because making milltary and army and troops and villages is so fun but we must fight evil!,5
Definitely not as cool as the ads and I don't think some of the stuff they showed is even in the game. It's your generic control territory pvp kingdom game but with a few extra bells and whistles like gacha! Performance was also a bit rough when opening menus.,2
Love it! It's such a great game with the realistic graffics and story including never ending quests but I do dislike the chat that pops up when you place the clan building to connect to the other players. Isn't there a button for hide the whole chat of something?,5
Not as advertised. It's just another civilization game. Still pretty good so far.,5
Game is good Just facing some internet issues..... And some lag issues while doing battle 👍,5
Good game but just like some others. Viking theme is cool.,4
"Good game overall. Good graphics and game play, but most big events in tribes happen 19:00 utc which is 04:00 in Seoul. So can't really get full experience. If in Korea game is not worth it.",3
Very nice game graphics are awesome if this game has offline mode I'll give 5 stars,3
"Was great, joined a friendly clan of new players, been having fun so far, I think its a great game, good time waster when youre into the "" Waiting time again, il check back in an hour or three. "" concept and joining raids with your tribe members. Can we expect to see more decorative village buildings though? That would be great. A few barrels, Carts, or some fish stands would be great, and 2k gems for a torch seems pretty expensive :/ either ways great game!",5
Pretty good but would be very preferable if it was good in the performance department,4
It is addictive and fun,4
"I was in a very dark place scrolling through YouTube, when an ad played, this was no ordinary ad though. It was this game. Since then, I have found a wife, I have 3 sons with 2 twin daughters on the way, and I own a great property up North. Thank you for changing my life, I have started a business that's very local and sustainable. I owe it all to this game, I would be dead without it.",5
very nice game but the hero exp grind is very hard kinda like pay to win,5
Lots of fun. There is a learning curve but worth the effort.,5
"Gameplay is awesome, but device get heat up after some time",4
"Good game , but after chapter 24 the grind becomes unbearable, im deleting this game lol not worth it",5
Its a good game with good graphics and ideas how to be socialist to each other,5
Love it fun I enjoy it everyday,5
So far seems fun a lot like other games but has a new twist will keep playing,4
"its fun right from the start. there is more individual gameplay too, which makes it interesting. its also easy to understand since they explain everything so well.",5
"so far everything is fine the story, the mechanics, the graphics and also add new style for RTS games. i didn't reach the world map yet my hope is to find new ideas instead of having same ideas as other rts games.",5
There's a lot to the game. Especially fun for RPG player's.,5
Graphics are Awesome and the game iis very fun to play!,5
I love the game But sometimes may phone is laging but it's ok it's only my phone problem 😍,5
The gameplay is good and the graphics is so good,4
"It's a beautiful game, and I want to love it. But I'm just not enjoying it. I'm still learning how to play but my progression is painfully slow. I feel very stuck and it's so early in the game. Not only that, I keep getting attacked by people who are much stronger than me. Every day, several times a day. It is extremely discouraging. I'm stuck, outmatched, and not having a good time. I'm probably going to give up.",2
Not my kind of game Where you gotta pay to play You can't build no farms gold mines stone But you can buy it from the store. My point is made have your Visa ready.,2
Very adictive game i love to plat it makes me feel like a real viking leader.,5
Enjoyable... good graphics. Will update as I play more.,5
very awesome game I'll recommend this to all my gammers friends. . . thanks for the creator gor making such a magnificent awesome game. . Greatest of all time game.,5
It's very timetaking but very less ads and very fun,5
Great game. I like the graphics and easy to play,5
Good game but things like upgrading can take a while,4
The game is good but 2 things that need addressed is the amount of screen clutter and no way to locate troops in the turf or in the kingdom map. You have to look for them.,3
Writing is tiny my eyes can't see . But i5s a great game.,4
Amazing game music best mobile game I recommended play,5
"Ever played Rise of Kingdoms and been totally rinsed? Well change the graphics for the current viking fad and this is it. Gameplay is exactly the same, pay to win. Free to players kidding themselves they have a chance. Seen it all before, unless you are prepared to shell out lots of cash, AVOID!",1
"Unlike any other Game of the same temprament . 💯 Graphics can be improved , it'll be unstoppable afterwards. But great thinking in building the overall structure of the game",5
nice games and i enjoy this for a while.,5
I love this game because it is very realistic,5
Good strategy game ..on a mobile.,5
The game is now good it is like assassins creed Valhalla but just up grading your village,5
"Not so much cause still like hard depend other game like this, and low resources",3
It's really fun I'm enjoying it alot,5
"It is similar to many RTS games out there but I gotta say the graphics is pretty good, it's cool seeing my champions roam around my base, and the store prices aren't crazy like most games are. Overall a great experience.",5
"It's pretty fun, I love meeting the other people who also play",5
Very good game and expect trading from one city to other city if added,4
"Good game play,battle graphics are simple",4
I have played many vikings games but they all were disappointing but this game is awesome..,5
Fun easy to get used to so far still early game ill update if need be.,5
Really interesting game. Nice game play and pretty self explanatory. Good job devs,5
"Very good, need more tech, mpre troops types.",5
"The game is really good 👍, no need for critics, is perfect.",5
It's pretty cool game it took me a minute to get into it but once I got into it actually pretty cool I like it,5
I love this game bc I win And lose at the same time 1000/10,5
Amazing quality amazing graphics everything you want in a good game That's why I gave it five 🤩,5
Good game and quality is wall,4
So far great game but I have only been playing for a few hours. Will update after a few days.,4
"I've suddenly lost my account when i launched the game even though I didn't change account or anything whatsoever, why is that? I'm back to level 1 again because of this.",1
Its fun it is pay to play but you can get up In might with out paying,5
Great time killer and awesome concept and storyline.,5
im a starter the story is good and ay have more to explore and secret,5
Game freezes to much,2
This is a good game but the pay wall does come for any real enjoyment.,4
"We can't do anything about P2P becouse they chose time over Money which is not wrong, problem start when game developer don't provide f2p chance to rise. Currently I'm happy as f2p with game...👍🏻",5
I've just started playing. I like the guided help because I'm new.,4
The ad is the same as it pretty much,5
I love the voices. I like that I cab read along.,5
It's a good game it really is my type with it's strategy,5
Amazing. Occasional lagging but overrall really good. Would recommend.,5
Nice game so far no problems I just started it..i hope it's won't give me problems as I play,5
I love this game but it take too much time to build the tower,5
Nice objective and easy to play.,5
Not bad I thought this game is look simple but after I start like this game and that was my best best!! Game in my life!,5
The best realistic fighting game,5
Great game of it's kind. In depth but fun and easy,5
This game makes user interface very compare to other game just really awsome game,5
This game is very good because everything in this game is real you are really in the world of vikings♥️♥️,5
Good game but graphics super and sounds excellent 👌 no ads final super game,4
Good game! Nice graphics and the story is cool,5
"Good fun, don't mind spending a few dollars on a well made game. My only gripe is that some ""quests"" are literally just ""buy this pack"". Forced transactions like that kinda ruin the experience a bit, however overall still a fun game.",4
I like role-playing games until they get way too hard to survive,4
Resource arch is very poorly balanced and convoluted. Progress halts entirely after the first two days of game play.,1
"Overall the game is good, the lag is unreal though.",3
Another time gate based game. Good graphics though,4
"Stupid decision to change Graphics / interface in recent update, makes it unplayable. Should have been kept same as earlier version. Thinking of uninstalling it if not fixed promptly.",1
Perfect game. Its so good im literally addicted to it 😅,5
Nice easy to learn and good story to help,5
"Solid game so far. Nice graphics. Reminds me of old city building games. Writing is solid, controls are elegant. Will update to a 5* or adjust to lower when i find the paywall.",4
Ot a fan of this kind of game. But keeping entertained for the time being.,4
It's like playing skyrim. It's. Really good,5
It's like clash of clans but slightly more interesting and better,5
Very good game enjoyed playing it 5 out of 5,5
fantastic really keeping me interested 😊,5
Much better then I expected and not as much a pay to win as other village games.,4
Really good art and graphics and good game play,4
Good but slow upgrading,4
Very through and live the graphics and gameplay,3
Nice game for strategy builder.. The graphic are cool,4
"Thank you to the creator of the game, it is a very good game Haji, you are very right.",5
"It is so real and fun. Plus I watched the show,and and that was great to.",5
The game is really good 👍👍 and having watched the game movie it makes it more interesting 😀😀 more likes to this game👍👍👍👍,5
Easy to play good story,5
Copy & paste game with weird people in chat. Sooo many things to click on. I was only able to download it today for the first time but there's people on there that seem like they've spent their whole lives on there haha. I spent a few dollars on it but I don't think it's really worth it.,2
Everything is good it takes a long time to upgrade,4
Amazing game and the game play us phenomenal,4
"I have waited for a long time for this type of strategy game, I have just started playing it & so far it's good...... Though so many options can be overwhelming sometimes; I guess it would ease up as I proceed & get familiar with it. Hope this game stays like this in coming times",4
The game is actually enjoyable and fun. True to what it is. Thank you,5
How do these games Do well When you have players spending thousands of dollars this game is pointless. It feels like a huge scam.,1
Best viking game in my life I've been stress for the whole month for finding a game that's enjoyable haha I think I found one I hope this game is gonna be popular😀,5
"The game graphics including the sea and the land, and the story line is amazing! Perfect for players who are finding a Empire game. This is awesome for me.",5
Nothing bad to say great time waster and fun to play.,5
"Very nice graphics, and plot.",5
Ivor looks very familiar I like this fun game pretty great graphics fun visuals,5
"So far I'm enjoying my time with it. Waiting to see how bad of a paywall I hit down the line, but no complaints so far.",4
Very good base builder game and the gameplay is also very good ..,4
Alot more story and thought put in this than most similiar games . Love it,5
Just different enough to have some surprises and fun.,4
This game is amazing the one bad thing is that at some point you will experience a lot of lagging,4
awesome and not to easy but not unplayable either pretty fun,5
just getting started but it looks great and theres lots to do,5
"Beautifully game. For now impressed. Great graphics. Relaxing music. Nice story. Good battles. Giving it a go for now, let's see after few days when I dive deeper in to it.",5
It a good game so far I'm enjoying it at the min but always room for improvement as with all these games,4
"Fast , fun, try it out",5
Really enjoying the game so far,5
Really I impressed with this game for Playing first time full statisfaction for playing 4 hours...,5
Nice game with strategy,5
Great music and voice work.,5
Good game not hard to play,5
Good gameplay and graphics. Fells open world,5
the adds make it look so cool and all but when I played it i was disappointed,1
Nice game 🎮 interesting game 🎯 nice thanks you for your love 💕 Viking rise 😇 Karthik Jabore,5
Pretty fun..I usually don't like these kinds of games but.. This one is pretty damn cool,5
Fun game. Clearly some bugs though. Some quests do not progress as anticipated. Some features seem bugged as well. I have not gained access to the Clan Merchant despite having Chief's Hall 15 and other high level things - no explanation provided as to how to unlock the Clan Merchant.,3
It's amazing upgrade ur defences fast and then upgrade ur power and ur gonna be unstoppable 🚀😍✨😂😂💪⚡💪,5
"I thought this is wasting of life game. It expect over and over. More time consuming, also not complete explained as state survival. Hero skill set is ruffly working. 10000 Torops T1 required here i have 15000 squad to march but still opponent is heavy. Research time is very killer type. From the beginning it cames with 10hr 🥹. Also battery consumption is high in my device instead of state survival.",2
"Playing this game less then a week. Game is awesome BUT you can't enjoy it at all since it get destroyed every moment. Not worth it at this time unfortunately. * Not recommending because of no way to defend, shields are ridiculous in value no defense available.",1
It is very good game to play and I love this type game,4
It is easy to play and the narrative is fun to listen to.,5
"Slow game, and if you play thru just play they skimp on actual points you get. Support from them is very slow, going to start a petition to get this game kicked off Google play if anyone is interested",1
Definetly a fun game it's good and has good graphic!,5
"Beautiful, engaging game. Good graphics and bgm👌",4
it is my first kingdom builder game and im actually enjoying farming and building stuff. very good game,5
Excellent games 💯 you must try,5
Pvp needs improvement but a great game overall!!!love it .I feel like a true Viking,5
Tutorial that forced every button press for over an hour and can't be played at all without the internet generally means it's money grabbing and predatory. Effort has gone into this cash grab. Which is a shame because these developers would be better placed on games where they aren't just abusing vulnerable people's addictions for money.,1
Great new rts game with quick play and graphics,5
Great storyline. Graphics and effects are awesome! Interesting heroes and skills interface. Lacking on the frequency of mystery merchant appearance and not very popular among players.,5
"Fun game, good graphics and great time killer",4
It is very realistic features that is thing it can sometimes lag❤️❤️❤️,5
"Best game ever, but do you have to have a login expiry date",5
Good graphics and good games you are develop and develop more high graphics game ♥️♥️,5
"The game is fairly good, but there are a few UI bugs even in the tutorial parts Just really difficult to press on things requiring restart to unfreeze. Galaxy S23 Ultra.",3
"Somehow my first review was deleted. I'll write it again, slightly updated. Lovely wait or pay strategy (that can't be *enjoyed* without making any purchases) with tons of stupid dialogs and unnecessary ""exciting features"". It's been a pleasant hour (or less). Uninstall and forget.",1
I really enjoy the viking era and I like that I can build my own settlement,5
Cool game and quick and easy to level up,5
Graphics could be better but overall Really good 😀 🐖😁 😀🐖 😃 😃 .,5
Only for rich kids..I quit the game,1
"Sooo enjoy your game guyysss... Player have change weather / season, but why minus rainy / storm / thunder?... I think its so fun... Keep update... We waiting something new... Overall good game... 👍👍👍✨️✨️✨️",5
"Really enjoying the game, easy enough to follow",5
Why do you update so much? Both update days are a joke or a prank?!,2
This game is best I like it to play and everything is going good,4
A LOT to do in game. Super fun. Looking forward to Yeats of game play. Gg,5
"Interesting game so far, engaging, lots of things to do. The story and graphics are beautiful. I noticed comments about lag time but it's not a big issue anymore.",5
"My gosh how many games are there now that follow the exact same identical template.. gather resources, build army, go into battle, die, gather resources, build army, go into battle, die. With developers hoping as they choke the game that as many people as possible get addicted and start spending money.",1
Been playing these exact same type of stategy games for years. Why tf is this one SOOOO much harder than every single other game I've played like this??? 7000 troops and a lvl 21 hero can't beat a lvl 1 bad guy in the field WITH a tribemate? I shouldn't need to sit here and read a wiki page or game guide in order to find out how many of what troops I need to beat a lvl 1. I'm out.,1
Awesome and wonderful...no ads ...just great,5
The game is pretty neat and a bit complex but fun,4
"Tacticallty. A game for war heros, who need their redemtion. Villains who are a mystery, hide still in the darkest of mists. Stay strong my fiends.",4
It's a nice building game to pass the time when I'm bored. I like it.,4
Fun game but the wording is too small to read.,5
"Fantastic storyline, music is fantastic!!! Game play is great but a wee bit dodgy on locating things. Am sure will pick it up pretty fast. Recommending the game to everyone, my wife my best friend ect. Good job all.",4
it is fun to play and if your board I recommend you to play this game so 5 stars,5
"Great viking theme game👍 I love the simplicity of the variety of functions, keeps a person busy without knowing it for hours.",5
Its good at quality and fun,5
Good game could definitely use some work like gathering resources kinda weird,4
It's decent but did they get the license to us a assassin's creed character,3
It great game but when I downloaded it .it says couldn't download I Downloaded it .it still doesn't work I think maybe u should find a problem and I want to download it so bad but can't thank you,1
Loving the pace and adventure of the game.,5
"This is amazing game.. so challenging every tasks i made,",5
"Took a week of attempting to download and it wasnt from my end. When it finally did, it lags so much I had to uninstall. Fix the issues and I might try again.",1
Incomplete game development. Most elementary features are not available. I was expecting upgrade or similar experience as age of empires but this is disappointing.,1
"Perfect game. Wow graphic, nice mechanics, great economic balance. Just needs more wide single player part (classic RPG) and more tactic flexibility. And NO PAYWALLS!!! Amazing",5
"I'm very surprised by the quality of this game. The graphics are amazing, nice storyboard, it teaches you how to play it in a very simple way. Very interactive and boosts your creativity",5
"I think pvp should be optinal one of the main resons I uninstalled is because I was constently attacked by other players . Also make bettles dependent on player input and strategy, not just point to what you want attacked and watch numbers go down. That is boring and annoying.",1
"Looks like this is a good game, fantastical, I have never been playing it but I am on my way to try this fantastic game, looks like it is fantastic, I am downloading it right now, I rated this 3 for now, but maybe later I will change my mind and rate it to 5.",3
Absolutel joke! Events run out well before you can complete them.! Building times are sooo long it's impossible to complete one task.! Forcing you to spend real money.! Another ripp off game trying to live off micro transactions 0/5,1
the game is good ... graphics story character are good...but the problem is sometimes the game crash on its own... sometimes network issue is a big problem.... otherwise the game so good for me,5
"Good game, and very enjoyable. But for some reason it over taxed my phone and burnt out the cpu. I have a high end phone that has never given me issues with any task or game until this one. Be careful playing this game.",3
It was fun for a while. Controls were took sometime to get used to. Then a high level player attacked me and I decided that its just another pay to win game so I quit.,1
Good game but I hate the fact you keep getting attacked offline and wake up having to harvest some much resources to get you back to pre-logoff. 5 days it's take. Have enough. Uninstall. Should be some protect for players who don't want to be involved in PvP,1
I tried but this is slow building up kind of game and lagging and terrible graphics and freezing up my device. I definitely deleted this game. Do not waste your time Come play Raid Shadow it differently much cooler.,1
"Game breaking mechanism: Typing a full sentence in clan chat crashes the game. No im not joking. Game breaking mechanism 2: It leaks ram, but you will hardly notice it between the frequent crashes. Next to unplayable technical speaking.",1
Too hard to get gems(literally 200 a day) and hard to upgrade(insufficient resources).this game is good but it's hard to continue because of these problems and it is too expensive to purchase.,3
"I don't like this game because there is no strategy in battles. When you attack, all battles are automatic without ability to control you units.",2
".. if you want to play this game for a long time, you will be the only left in the game......it creates participation of players joined at certain point of time. And that section dies slowly......... personally this thing forced me to leave the game. I was a clan leader with 20million strength",1
I really really enjoy this game but it's so bad with glitching and buffering I got irritated and just unstalled it I didn't wanna but I had no choice I checked all my updates and everything good but I really really like this game please fix the glitching and buffering and I will put this game back on my phone thanks God Bless,3
Nb:(All the advertisement are fake that are not related to actual gameplay) they are promoting fake advertisement for this so don't trust the ads.otherwise the game is good little bit addictive after 3 days of playing I hated this game it's boring.its really doing tasks and unlocking other islands and training troops etc..so if you are here for download this game by watching the advertisement don't install it's fake.,2
"Its nice in the begining, but just like all the other games of its sort, every level up starts to take longer and longer.",3
i like graphics and UI and fighting better then other games but game needs time to become a powerfull city but few things i mention here troops are so weak in starter game also building update time one thing is best in this game is hire volunteers to gether things same time please increase the builders and increased traffic in new server am from server 56 overall i like the game and am still learning new things but i will edit my review later as well after go more high levels thanks.,5
"Awesome game. Love the phases of the game so far. I do think it's a lot of information to grasp quickly, but the storyline helps with instructions.",4
"I admire the hard work and dedication that went into this game, BUT, another idle Viking game! Do the devs. think we're all 6 years old. Make a game we can control, not idle farming.",1
They will take items from your inventory and will not reimburse them. They have a broken customer service which is a bot that doesn't resolve anything and the live representatives will brush you off you the bot every time. You have been warned.,1
"Takes very very long to load. Internal game play is so slow, so stopped playing for a few weeks with 40k odd troops out and not attacked, seems really dead.",1
It is a strategy game unless your as powerful as the others. Strategies is useless when your power level is so low compared to others. Overall I will give it a 3 out of 5 nice game!!,3
I'm playing this game for 27 consecutive days and got bored with less tribe members participation for the events. Many people initially tried to feel the game but fewer are excited to stay active. Events like beast lairs at level 1 already required high participation. How should players motivate to continue this game ? Only top 3 tribes are aggressive in recruiting current active members to continue the game. That's disaster for long run. Please keep the game easy for fun,1
It's a very good game when you start but as you go on it becomes seriously very complicated. You get so many options and there are so many things that you don't even understand what's going on. Stopped playing the game first day itself. 👎,2
Like so many games its like playing a casino slot machine. Great graphics and design. Just another pay to win. Hurry up and buy type game.,1
"At first, this app was really nice. After sometime it got boring and then it started to have LOTS of glitches and bugs. Please fix that. Thanks.",3
"The game is interesting. I had to stop playing cause, after a stage I could not go further . The stage where I had rally fellow tribe members to kill nilfung leader. If the creators can guide me, I would like playing this again",4
Fun game and spending isn't necessary unless you feel you have to be on the top. Most people in my server are friendly one or two with fowl attitudes and mouths but over all I like it ..,5
"It's pretty good so far. No server lags, graphics are great, story an game are fun so far. Definitely worth it.",4
This game is fun and all until you reach chapter 24 qnd you have to defeat forbidden gate defenders then the game loses the fun all together. i spent a week trying to upgrade my troops in hope to pass this stage but all in vain 💔 it's just made impossible to win against them,1
Just started playing but so far so good. Easy game play. Getting to the point where things get longer to upgrade but that was expected. Will update as I play more.,4
"Not bad , but it's boring after playing 2 or 3 day continuously, and then all you do is claim everything they gave ,training warriors and conquer. it's just too basic!!",3
The game is very good so far the graphics are great voice overs are great and the gameplay seems pretty standard.,5
I like the ease of play and level up options. Great graphics and stories. Will continue to play.,5
Its a wonderful game a masterpiece great job developer but i have a bit problem i have to character in one device and 1 more in other device when i switching it takes to long loading sometime stack morethan 5mins,5
"By Chapter 7 you can't proceed any more. The game leads you to attack until you can't gather, build or proceed. Fun while it lasted.",2
"Worst game ever, can't find a way to remove the kingdom chat. Becomes so annoying but no way to hide it. Uninstalled after the tutorial ended.",1
"The game works well until you finish the starting area, then there's nothing but tribe wars to occupy the player. The game quickly devolves into grinding or paying for unsatisfying pvp battles.",3
"Solid gameplay. Visually stunning. Good collage of all the usual game mechanics. Nothing new, but boy it looks and plays nice.",4
"Boring and laggy, the advertising of this game is horrendously agressive so I'd thought I'd give it a try but the game is badly optimized so it lags tremendously.",1
Horrible experience. Need to collect resources to defeat boss. Need to defeat same boss to collect resources. An unplayable Catch-22. DO BETTER!!!! 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫,1
I can't login it's says login expired overall game is good,1
Even though I just started out playing this game it is very interesting and it is easy to understand,5
The game is good but at the beginning of the game I would have gave is a 3 star but I like the game better so that is why I gave It a 5 star,5
"Early game level 3 and some research already takes near 1 hour, resources hard to come by",2
Iam not play this game. But i watch Viking web series. I realy love this series so 5 star retting this game,5
My girl gets mad at me because I can't let down my tribe! I play everyday. This should be on console or pc,5
"P2w, whales just hit low levels on resource nodes for easy event kills. All events changed so there impossible to complete unless you pay to speed them up. About 50 players switch to each others tribes to grab server first rewards from the top 4 tribes. The top 4 tribes started farming each other in the same tribes in the jungle event to exploite the event ruining it for others and the devs seem to allow it, shame was a good game before it became toxic to newer players.",2
Was fun but kept getting attacked. Losing everything and spent money for no good. Only play if you have tons of $ to waste. Very disappointed.,1
I really like the game but all the issues and lag time and the game just freezing or turning off on it's own may be too much trouble to keep playing wish they fixed all these issues before releasing it imo,4
So far the game is really awsome. Love the viking theme.,5
It's fun i like how thr game looks,5
Very fun and addicting,5
"Same city dev, send armies out to autocalc attacks game as so many others. It works okay. I don't have anything bad to say other than lack of originality.",5
I love Viking mythology and culture and this game has both. Easy to play and fun,5
"Worst Game,because I have found some bugs in the game and had raised the complaint personally to them, and have attached the bug with video evidence but they says it's yours device problem, I have latest updated device but the blaming the player, it's not fare,so that I have given a single star rating.",1
Not at all like the ads gameplay.,1
"I can't hire the mercenaries, is it a bug hope it is fixed soon",3
"Great graphics! Haven't played much yet, but so far, so good!",5
Best game but give us 3d look of our village so this game also best looking our army and if it is possible to make this more 3d rotation and try give us fpp and tpp look an 📸 option to see real it us game all the best Try to make this very high graphics,5
Very nice game as well now Fe details as the story is very nice,5
Just started alot to learn but seems alot of fun,5
This game is awesome and graphics are pretty good the story is also great good job for the man/woman who made this masterpiece 👏 I have no complaints,5
This is the best viking game ever.,4
Lots of things to do to keep you entertained,4
Fun easy play,4
"it was good, I took a break for 2 to 3 months, then boom. data is gone. no matter what I try login through, no hope. fix this, and maybe I'll reconsider",1
nice graphics very realistic and fast paced.,5
"Good game, not for small screens.",4
A very good game indeed the story line is very good I rlly have nothing to say,5
Not long been playing but it's great fun with loads to do,5
"I can make it 10 star if you add atleast 2 builders in city because now you only have 2 builders, I hope you will add atleast 2 additional builders in city. I recommend this game to everyone it is very interesting game.",5
Lagging too much.,1
Love it so far. Awesome story without it being over bearing. It's a bit hard to see but the controls are easy and you don't feel lost as you can easily find out what you are supposed to do and how,5
This games is very lag and my cellphone is blackout but this game is very nice,1
Addicted literally like i cannot stop playing this game its everything i ever wished to play highly recommended,5
I change my rating. I cannot push through with the game. Stuck with defeat level 1 niflung. I Changed tribes couple of times but no luck.,1
Early days but very engaging and good in all ways 👍,5
"Very flawed game, nothing for lower levels only the top 20. Do not waste your energy and time, could if been a better game but maybe the makers smoke weed, game is so badly flawed",1
Very good graphics.it is the best game in the world(game recommended),5
"Installed from Mistplay. Viking Rise never credited Mistplay for the install and now I can't earn a certain level of points for play. If Viking Rise doesn't do something about this, I will uninstall.",1
Too much pay content detracts from an otherwise epic game,4
Fun for this kind of game. Easy progression.,4
"Nice and easy, some in game purchase would be nice 🙂",5
It's a good game great traffics,5
Great game. Easy to play.,5
Great job! Great display and game play!,5
I love the graphic and also the the gameplay. Edited review : I change my review to 4 stars because i found a view bug. 1. Can not claim rewards from inbox 2. Tha app crashing and close automatically Please fix that.,4
Ads of this game are difficult to close.,1
Great graphics great audio.Fun in general.,5
I've been looking for a game like this. Finally came across Viking Rise because it looked promising. I downloaded it and do not regret my decision! Super rewarding and smooth gameplay. Great art and voice acting as well,5
"The game has a great story and it seems fun to play so far as of 4/26. The game has its down sides too though like upgrades early on when you have barely any resources, costing a lot",5
Best graphic and many playing options,5
"So much to like but, like all the games built on multiplayer, sucks because of other players. I've officiallygiven up on multiplayer!",3
graphic not so good,4
"Ok this game is very fun and no need to pay to play, but i got a big problem... I joined a tribe , but i cant relocalise my kingdom next to him, always saying the pier is not connected, i got a free teleportation, but need to be in tribe territory, i heard we need 3000 ruby to teleport, i bought them with real money, but cant find where to buy the fixed relocator, and every new tribe member can teleport, but im stuck with the damn pier not connected,,, cant it be a lil bit more simpler????",4
the story is very good there is so mach adventure,4
your typical city builder but well polished and interesting so far,5
Good voice acting and the game play is fun,5
great building at your own pace love it,5
Amazing its really worth having a battle and farming game.,5
"This game is quite addictive and a lot of fun. The concept is interesting and really held my attention, but it is terribly pay to win. ONE player Whale can wipe out your entire tribe even if you're in the top 5. Very bad.",2
"Decent game, if you have played these sort of games, need to figure what your doing, little light on explaining things. But definitely worth a try. Suspect as you developed your town, it will get a higher rating",3
"Awesome game guys, try it, you won't be disappointed trust me.",5
I love the graphics but overall it's so fun.,5
Lagging is killing me but graphics were good.,2
Really slow and boring. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing and interacting with the map is very confusing. I want a smoother game with more defined goals,1
It's a nice game to play and is addictive,5
One of the best game I am enjoying now on my phone,5
Awesome 👍 I like this game and I'm playing continuously ❤️,5
"Excellent graphics, good experience so far",4
It is so realistic and has so much deatail!,5
my uncle got me playing since I'm in to vikings fun game all around.,5
Is a good and interesting game with an interesting challenge,4
Fantastic! I like it so much!,5
The game is good but it is hard to gather wood early game,5
The hit boxes for resources are ridiculously bad.,1
its has very good graphics and is all in all a wonder full game,5
"Massive potential, Massive letdown. Whales own everything, dead player base..",1
"The pace for growth is faster than most ganes I've played of the genre ,which I really like and enjoy,also the first purchase offers are also the best part nog draining the pocket ,over a pleasant change of pace for a familiar genre.",5
I just love this graphic design and it was so fun,5
This game is very intersting and graphics are so amazing i like this game🥰👍🏻,5
I'm playing this game From some time there is no problem except one That our tribe member can't live with us and fight with us,3
So far loving the game. I like how you can free move your players and attack where you want to attack. I just hope their is good rewards that will keep me invested in the game. But so far 8.9 out of 10. I want to see if their is good rewards to build and train troops.,5
Super cool! It feels like permanent age of empires,5
Really enjoying this game a lot,4
It's a good game I just wish wen you go into battle that you could see more,3
Early stages of this I have found really enjoyable and I'm in a good clan with nice people also. My only gripe is STONE being a nightmare to get without buying packs. I get this will get better as the game goes on but you can mine it enough to build and you can't raid it enough because nobody has excessive amounts.,4
Well it was a great game untill the new updates you've just had. Now it doesn't load and it's slow. That slowy phone froze and I couldn't turn it off. Not happy with the update at all....... Now it's terrible,1
The game graphic design good and The sence of game are good,4
"In this game the ad doesn't lie to you it really shows you what's going on,unlike lords mobile.",5
good game but its so frustrating when someone with higher mighty attacked your base hahaha,5
A good game with good graphics and story,5
I'm on level 5 it takes way to much time to play the game,1
The game is a historic game that takes you back in time to look at the viking times,5
Love this game better than others an cool animation to go with it,5
Game is very slow starting out. Has a very good feel to it Hope it doesn't turn out to be one of those games that you grind out the starting stages and then turns into a RTSMMO type of game.,5
So far like the sto4y and graphics,3
Put people in charge of chat otherwise you will lose alot of customers for example look at state chat. I think people want to play a game with out politics involved,1
Good quality and graphics..and nice game,5
"Igg let's too many cheating whales play on server 134 like death coil, Avatar and most of TLO so I advise new players to stay away from server 134 or you'll be used as a farm animal by TLO",1
"Pretty fun tbh, love the vibe",4
To hot to handle. but a master piece of a game.,5
It's alright game but graphics could have been better,4
"I like this game, the words could be bigger when needing to read",5
Love the graphics,5
A little lag in game play but only by second the storyline and graphics are excellent. It's not overly easy which is good one of the best mobile rpg games out there. I am at the edge of seat with the storyline.,4
"Lovely game! Strategic and engaging, good graphics and I'm just loving the Vikings style or theme. Great",5
Very like the game concept n storytelling. Recommended this game.,5
Actually best valor game. I personally loved this.,5
Really enjoying the game graphics,5
Hahahaha almost identical like the ads loved it,5
Great but I have some legendary heros that I can't get the rest of the fragments and I wish I could,5
Welp installed the game and played for a few hours. Logged in last night and unable to log in. Reached out and apparently my account was banned. Only talked to my bf in the game cause he installed it too so it wasnt for language. I purchased an item with my google account from the game store also. Used their special gift codes their discord provided. Other than that I just played the game so no clue why my account was banned. Now I have to wait for an appeal to get my account back.,1
So far it looks like a good game to play will update my review later again,4
This is very amazing game and I'm enjoying this game very much❤.,4
Easy to play with the guidelines.,4
Very interesting game. Love it the storyline is cool.,5
It is so like clamish and extremely difficult BUT easy,5
It's pretty good. I'm not usually into mobile games but I've been non stop playing this today.,5
"Addicting, easy and fun.",5
Very easy fun good graphics good build good game,4
"The game is same as the other online clicking games build and RT's. But LOOTING AND SAVING FOR UPGRADE TAKES TIME ALOT OF TIME. THEN AFTER A STRONGER ENIMIES PLUNDER YOUR BASE. NOTHING WILL BE SAVE EVEN YOU FUXKING WHOLE DAY LOOT FOR UPGRADE ,AND THEN THEY WILL LEAVE YOU A COUPLE OF HUNDREDS. WAREHOUSE PROTECTION IS PACKING USELESS. BTW THEY GIVE YOU ALOOTT OF GEMS. DAILY. SO THIS IS STILL A PAY TO WIN AND NOT THE GAME FOR THE POORS.",3
"Fun, exciting, addictive",5
"Nice game , but I am facing some issue like lagging etc .",3
I realy love it because it a realistic game thank you for making it!,5
This game is good but I don't like this types of games but it's good that's why I give this game 3stars out of 5 stars 😀😀,3
"Great game would give it 4 stars but it's hard to zoom in , out and move I'd prefer like arrows or joystick some other way of moving around you can make its need to change in settings",3
Loving this game not sure what im doing yet but ill get there,5
Almost a good game cause it took me a while to learn how to use the options.,4
"Great fun, addicting",5
5 stars for now. Just started playing but will update review. Great so far though!,5
"So far so good, could make the instructions a little clearer but a decent game. Have a bit of a loading lag occasionally though",4
"I do think this is a good game, but it keeps closing on me fromfor no reason.☹️",2
"Nice game. if you ain't playing this game, you are missing a lot of fun guy",5
"Passive game play, well executed theme, and storyline.",5
Nice game easy to play and best graphics,5
in lthe begining it was so great after that its to slow in upgrade in troops even in every thing no mine to extract wood or food every thing with hands manuale its so borring even in missions its diffecult and to make troops all with team up its so bad iam so upset to play this game over 8 hours in day,2
Nice game..different from other game..,5
"It's a good game,good job on making it",5
"false advertising, scams with speedups",2
Good game for time waste,5
Nice game ...... I like this idea of combination of coc and the prob arc survival kinda thing,5
This game is so cool but couldn't we heal the wounded soldiers too,5
One of the best games in a long time. I just want my other account back. Now I must start from the beginning,5
It is much more fun to play than to see those adds love It,5
Very entertaining and easy to play,5
Just started playing and so far I LOVE it!!!! If anything changes I will update but so far it's GREAT!!! Keep up the good work!!!,5
Nice game no problem is there in this game I tell to all please download this game,5
Fun and smooth,5
"Dead slow game, basic research takes forever, stopped playing when I saw T2 troop unlock takes about 12 hrs each..you got to be kidding with this kind of dead slow game play..",1
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! ALLOW HIGH LEVEL PLAYERS TO MIGRATE! I'M IN A SERVER WITH CHEATERS THAT YOU ALL ARE DOING NOTHING ABOUT AND I'M ABOUT TO QUIT! I HATE MY SERVER! FIX IT!,1
Very informative has decent graphics and I love Vikings,5
"Omg,.. Why crash always right now... I'm on may wat to next level ... In update village",3
Best game but Need to polish and make it smoother...,3
It's a good game but needs to improve and needs regular updates like other rpg games or it will soon be unfavourable and the game developers need to put a bit more effort on it,1
I'm loving this game the graphics and gameplay is the best over all its best game I ever played,5
Very realistic..enjoying alot.,5
"Last update is worst from 2 mil per day rss each (for 7 day its 14 mil per rss) now they drop to 35% of that so low, and cant get them when you want but need to wait weekly reset.. dont to mention events that doesnt workin.",1
Really good game. Just like the Ad. Big fan,5
"This game is great, especially the map, it's so beautiful, your company should raise the salary of the map designer immediately!",5
Very nice gameplay i love it so much,5
Great game absolutely loving it,5
"Every update will be better than before, please keep it up And please add the Farsi language",5
I just find it relaxing to play ▶️,4
This is awesome to play ❤️💯,5

N0 words very very good game,5
Love it so far so good.,5
I like how fun the game is and I like how they show you how to play very well!,5
broo this is so sick i played this for 5 hour per day,5
Look out for obscure subscriptions. Youll be charged every month and not realize it,1
"The Game very nice, good graphics and nice flow,,im an IGG fan",5
"Within 1 hour, we find people with 1M power . Its a scam game. Developers create strong accounts to force you spend more to win. Uninstalled the game as it's obvious we cannot fight the strongest cause they are the developers . Have seen a lot of pay win games but not a scam like this.",1
How to upgrade main castle in level 15,4
"Good story in game, but fix the bug",4
Waited forever for the release and I'm so happy this game is good! I love the atmosphere and people. Customer Service is also amazing! JUST AN AWESOME GAME!,5
Worst game ever we loose every thing after some time do not install,1
It's very interesting game.looks like a PC 4D game.,5
The game feels great so far.,4
Nice relaxing development program for a warring town.,5
"It has an rts feel to it like empire earth, i like and its fun so far",5
Fun game but definitely don't look or feel like the trailer. I really want an old PC strategy game on the phone but so far it's all click bates,3
"Very nice game, been playing for almost 4 months now and i really liked this game.",5
Great game with beautiful graphic and addictive gameplay,5
The game graphics are amazing,5
Beautiful game with a gorgeous soundtrack.,5
The game ever seen has good graphics and survival game,5
t I don't like the way they force you to use items b4your ready too.,4
It's very fun if you have time,5
it isgood to run a small empire and watch it grow tromenosly,4
I love it!! It's a good time passer,5
This game is a bit repetitive.,4
I loved this game but don't know why the app is again and again closing automatically after 10 minutes of opening this is the only game in which such problem has occurred,2
It's all good just a lot to take in,4
Love to play but it's a bit small to look at,4
Game was bad at the beginning for the Gateway more better when you play it more get good and harryaaa,5
"I had to change the review, I just updated it yesterday, today I have to update it again, I don't know what was updated, I don't know, it would be different if I was given a consolation, half a star for all this",1
I am really enjoying your Viking Rise game. These graphics and game play is very updated from other games in same category as this one even other with close in name. I love your amazing time you spent building this game thank you very much and for being part of earning apps gives us game play and some pay too which only way I'm making money right now so appreciate it. Hugs and smile have great week. 🤗,5
Fun so far. Descent setup for build and battle,5
"Enjoying the game good play, but need time to play",5

Very nice game but graphics is not good,4
Game is fun to play upgrade your troops and fight,5
Looks good enjoying games and so big game,4
This game is like empires old school,5
It's easy to understand how to play and is really fun,5
Game is good but kinda boring,4
"I like this game , because u have to be strategical",5
I've been playing this game for 4 hours and didn't even know it. Time goes by fast inside this game.,5
Not bad l sleep late every day because of this game,5
Entertaining interested in learning how to play,4
"If the Arabic language is added, it will be great",5
The music is relaxing,5
It's an interesting game...have to be patient...dun need to spend $$ to enjoy de game but it'd be a slow progress though...I recommend to try dis game out..,5
Slow to start but good when up and running,3
"It's a very interesting game, I love the way the game progression I highly recommend this game",5

It's a cool and a interesting game.,4

So far it's been a great experience. Good way to pass time and have fun .,5
A good game i love it and my friends don't know it lol,4

Game is fun to play easy to understand,3
I'm enjoying the changing of weather and night into day sequence,5
Very Very very Good Viking Rise game to play,5

It's good I like the the way it looks so far,5
"The game is sow good ,has nice graphics I love it !",4
Great if you like age of empire,5
great game.the construction time nd research time is the only critique i guess and maybe some improvment in battling scene against other foes.this will difinitely stay long in my phone.,5
game is good but new update removed me from my tribe leader this is not good I have a feeling that this game uninstall 😒,3
I'm having so much fun! Addicted!!,5
Same concept at first was interesting but continuely it's became boring 💤,2
"I am very satisfied 😊 I hope you guys,, maintain the quality and quantity of this game thank you",5
So far I like it needs more speed up rewards,5
"Non-stop lagg, the chat is distracting and way to many widgets on screen. Please make it that they can be reduced and/or hidden.",2
It's fun and a really great experience,5
Good game good storyline too,5

Awesome game. Really fun still pay to win but all war games are thats why I will not give one a 5*. That being said this is a war game of its own kind. Very cool game all hail Odin,4
"Good so far, the wait to upgrade everything does take a bit",3
I really do like this game it's a fun way to distract your mind,5
Lovely and time killer game easy to improve in anycase of this game,5
Won't even download. And before you say it's my Wi-Fi or it's my problem. Half these games are garbage. And the other half you have to pay for. It's a shame,1
Super lovely game I found on play store🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤗,5
"Just another money grabber game. Maybe will overcome Lords. Cannot enjoy the game until ""bullies"" burn your whole tribe. Uninstall because it will never be f2play friendly. Otherwise, the game is great . Just a bit laggy, but great.",3
"Good game nonpop ads, so far no pay to win",3
Very fun and easy to understand,5

Lags and crashes too many times I'm out...,1
"Music is brilliant, graphics same",5
The game have great graphics and well planned,5
On screen event sales and ads should be removed,4

Really good graphics and good action,4
"Similar to Doomsday, fun & enjoyable",5

"Pretty good so far, I'll update as I progress",4
"Loving it! Best best best! They should make this into a playstion game. Great story line, great graphics and heroes too! And no ads, just a quick 'check this pack' and u wanna check once u get to know the game. Fun and engaging. Thanks Vikings!",5
It's the best game I've ever played in my entire life and the best thing is that there is no ads,5
this game is very good and the gricph is amazing but i dont like those kind of games i like the games that you controller your army 100 percent and like its a 3D game and your army is behind you you can see them all and if you attack it will be like you attack with your army other ways its cool,3
Very cool game and easy to progress fast!!!,5
The Best game I have played.,5
Better protect base and log in often enough because others will steal your resources in this viking themed basic mobile strategy because why change things up. So basic. Lame pvp in cool setting. Just a city build and defend from random attacks woulda been cool. Not dealing with whales that roflstop your base for resources.,2
Best combat game ever and I can't put my phone down it's drawn me in,5
Very nice it can compete coc if it upgrade itself more n more,5
Very nice game,5
Always crashing . Kindly fix it,1
Great game like fr no ads for the first time,5
Excellent game Jus wish there were more opportunities to gain heroes,5
honestly i just downloaded it to get rewards in another app but i quite like it,5
This game so amazing 🤩🤩🤩,5
This is tha best game,5
Apologies but i seriously think the game is not that really good comeon dude 1000 gems for 8hours shield dude better improve the buildings also don't misunderstand me it's a good game but other than buildings and shield the game is good 😊,3
"So far so good, I'll give it more stars the longer I play it, if I continue to like it.",3
Pretty good but there are some bug with the camera,4
"Awesome game, yol should definitely try it.",4
So far it is fun.,4
Good graphics and more adventures play,5
I like this game . Easy to play and instructions are clear.,3
It is a very good game,5
This game is very good and realist,5
Super fun! Highly recommend as a boredom cure,4
"Amazing game honestly 😎 I love the graphics and the way it brings me back to my fav movie of all time.,.... Awesome experience 👍",5
I give a 3star the game is download speed is too slow it's changed the users mind set so the producer pls check and improve the speed for the download thank you! I give the balance 2star after game play 💯👀,3
"1000% pay to win, if you don't spend there's absolutely nothing at all you can do, can't even buy shields.... Definitely don't even try, I don't think I've ever played a more pay to win game than this....",1
Keep slowing down to a stop. Stops. Keeps shutting down every few seconds. Keeps stopping my clock. I have to take out the clock and put it back in to work.,1
Absolutely amazing game! I really love it. I love building my Viking army and getting new heroes the game is very addicting. Probably one of the best army building game there is and it's crazy how it's been out for so little time and it's good I really want to see multiplayer in the future,5
"Another copy of an existing game. Stop reskinning games and make new ones! So boring i played 3 games that are Identical to this.. only here its ""vikings"" instead of like ""fantasy"" or modern ""military"" or ""syfi in spae"" . its the same game under a different name. Shameful.",2
I have recently seen an ad of ur game and i thought it will be like those boring games but i still tried it and i am gonna say that i was wrong it's hardly been a day i have played and it's very enjoying hopefully u add strategic attack plans such as a particular number of infantry goes to some other place and another team goes somewhere else to fight like that i want if u didn't understand there is a game called us conflict that style of game i want hopefully u add it,5
I really like this game. So far at least it says what it is in the ads from the various games I own and some cuts gotta be made to fit in 15-30 seconds. Thank you for the great game the darkness of voodoo and other cash grab games,5
"Just a tedious crashathon ... Got to lvl 5, didn't play for a couple of days then loaded it to find I'm back at the start ... Crash after crash. I've ditched it, wouldn't bother.",1
"Game is fun. Typically this game is like every other strategy/build battle game except with vikings. That's why I like this one. Would be cool to give this a little less constriction and maybe a little more free build(i.e. make roads, turn houses around, maybe custom wall) just a suggestion",5
"Desinged to suck your wallet dry, as higher level players suck your resources dry so you can't build anything unless you spend RL money to just have it happen all over again rinse and repeat. IGG yes It can be played free but if you actually read my review. You can't build if your resources are stripped by higher players everyday unless you spend money but that means they will just strip what you just paid for don't even mention that you can use protects that will run out and rinse and repeat.",1
Please PLEASE remove the new updates!!! The game now doesn't work! Keeps crashing.... To slow and freezes my phone.... It was great before the new updates last week.... Can't play it. Takes ages to move. Takes ages to do anything. Nothing is working,2
Addictive game with spectacular environment graphics and character models. Easily a 9/10. Can't wait to see the newest update!,5
It's an ok game...I like the viking thing...but it's just like other build a base and attack others game...spend money to be the best or be a punching bag for those that do...and the screen is cluttered with far to much,2
"I'm loving it, I would just like to suggest to allow a bit more zoom for those of us with poor vision so we can enjor the graphic details a bit more lol but other than that it's awesome",5
At some level it become pay to continue game.. m stuck .. i can't level up any further.. Number of troops depends on level of hero.. what is the meaning of having more legendary heroes if you wont even have exp book to level them up.. !! If have 4 legendary hero but i dont have books to level them up. !!,1
Just another base build game. Nothing new. Has a bit of story but it's same as other 100 base building games out there. Good graphics and at the start will give you few interesring hours.,3
Starts out p2w -> 1st update comes out with balance changes -> becomes more p2w -> players quit. A game isn't a game if the only factor is how much money you spend on it. Typical braindead IGG signature. I do not support you because your bussiness doesn't understand the fundamentals of a game. You don't develop inconveniences into a game so you can offer a paid solution to fix these mistakes you've intentionally put into the game.,1
"It's really exciting, the design, the voice acting, perfect so far I played. And finally we have a game with better time-management",5
"So far, so good. Graphics are insane plus what they advertise is what is actually in the game for once, unlike those other games that lie a lot. Hoping this game gets better and better with future updates",4
Worst experience ever. Game isn't letting me move even with a teleport and every time I try to reach customer service the app closes. Don't waste you time if you are really trying to actually play,1
Bought a pack that was supposed to have a season worker and i didnt get it. Game is so buggy and customer support didnt help at all with the missing items. Dont buy anything in this game cause you wont even get it. Reported,1
"Last week i downloaded Vikings rise. In the begining game seemed fun. You start building your viking empire and get alot of supplies. After lvl 7 you can clearly see that the game is basic trash like any other that type. Armies are boring, managing your unprofitable villages are dumb same as mission . Usually clans are made of kids and p2w players. Game progression is turning from good and potential to bad and p2w. If you want to learn anything about Vikings rise, just read 1/2/3 star comments.",2
"Amazing game, awesome graphics and amazing gameplay, just keeps lagging out of the game and when I uninstalled and tried re installing it made me delete 24 apps off of my phone and then doesn't end up installing again and then tries and makes me uninstall more.",5
"It's only 3 stars because it's loading and then automatically returns to the main background of my cellphones, I hope it can be activated immediately, the game would be great, I'll give it 5 stars when it's fixed",3
Very good quality game with all things related to Viking stuff .l do find when you runout of gems and go to the store all the gem offers are very expensive and I think that there should be more challenges to get more gems for free and building speed-ups but very good quality I love the game 😀😃,5
"if I could rate this 0 star's I would, this games is horrible the games Ui is buggy to high heaven's, the progression take months unless prepared to spend 1000's or pounds (£) and you can't progress because everyone who as a higher strength then you feels the need to demolish everything that you have built just by scouting and sending there troops which isn't fair at all, I'm not even being funny but if you want people play and spend money you need to make progression ten times easier to progres",1
I've seen games like this is just copied idea from another games with the same concept the difference the style with this game it has a decent storyline but mostly just expect concept from another games which makes war games quite boring because their not unique in any way the just want people pay to win and be the top spender always wins,1
This game is good with excellent graphics but the main problem i have faced is that this game is not performing best in low end device like 2 or 3 gb ram phone it lag to much overall this game is good but need lot of obtimization for smoot game play for low device . Clash of clans is also heavy game but that work smoothly,4
"Genuinely thought at first that this would be a game where the ad was ripped from PC but then I saw after giving it a chance not only is it IGG (I've played lords) so that actually made me think ""wait is this genuine?"" Then when I saw the game oh my god it looks great. Still got similar training system to Lords just seige machines are porters (transport) and pikemen instead of cavalry",5
"Runs smoothly even on high graphic settings. Has a voiced introduction, and the tutorial and prompts given are quite clear. Great game with great graphics.",5
So far so good! I am actually enjoying the game when i was asked to rate it. packs are not needed so far but they are really cheap. so thats good. i havent encountered any ads or paywalls yet.,5
A great time to play love the Era. Explains things well if you. Very user friendly and fun time playing. Just wish battle scene were a bit more indepth but that may change I have hopes for this game.,4
All appearances so far are pretty pleasing to the eyes but my problem is i cleared space to download this app and it's install makes me wait until till a 100 percent but won't let me play it! Can use some help understanding the issues I have not being able to play it.,2
The game needs to add some better user functionality to keep the builder's going and a more streamlined beginning tutorial. I will need to see more of the actual game first. Before a proper rating is given.,4
"Will give 5 stars once you get rid of this problem: Trying to relocate to my tribe's location using targeted relocator and it says ""Pier cannot be connected.Unable to move City to designated location."" Other than that I love the game , f2p friendly so far.",5
It's ok. The warehouse doesn't protect much though so there is nothing preventing heavy spenders from just teleporting around harvesting every drop of resources out of every other player on the whole map,3
Cool game so far. Similar to other games in the space. The viking aesthetic is a nice touch though. And so far no issues or bugs,4
Please update the game 1.Decrease warehouse capacity 2.also put shield cooldown when someone attacks kingdom 3.I can attack same kingdom many times . think. You should put kingdom health. Which decrease when someone attacks ... This game is good but need improvement,2
i pulled a character named HELGAR I already have it and i was interested on upgrading and making it strong. Suddenly after the recent update they didn't gave a notice and removed it!. I wasted my hero gems not knowing they remove that character!,1
"Like the look, and feel of this standard strategy game. Works well on my Android phone, but on PC, Bluestacks creates havock. Leaving everything but UI blue. Ironic? Perhaps. ;)",4
"Basically rise of kingdoms with a differnt theme. Same buildings, same sort of heroes classes and troops. Not sure if this game was required when there's already a good dozen of Rise of kingdom's copies (or originals, idk which came first)",4
I keep getting kicked. It slows down and then i get kicked. I just started playing too. Hope you guys can find the bugs and fix it.,3
"The greatest game I ever played,as a fan of Vikings web series this game is perfect for me ,but developer can do more like Ragnar needs to be top hero mythic ,and make this game more optimized to low end devices like clash of clans when slide the map or when win for some seconds it lags please look into this ,more love, respect to the developers ❤️👍☺️",5
Functions are too small. No future. Hard to do any pvp or conquer other region. Slow progress and need to grind lot time. Explore style is outdate. Today we need palace or white house for player see and set goal which road to take and capture before overcome the palace.,1
"Good game,good graphic,,but need to gather lumber like that,manage the worker EVERYTIME we start to play,,better do this by auto..& focus on playing game,upgrade warrior then war sometg like that like Clash of clan or Call of dragon game..that is more important i think,everytg else just fine.",3
"This is game is pay to win. You need to spend money in order to grow after reaching above CH 12. They really need to be more empathy with lower spender players. If you are willing to spend money, feel free to play!",3
Great game love the graphics and the turn base style easy to move and go up levels overall it's a great game 🎮🎯 just need more players to join the fight.,5
"Reminds me of good old RTS games. The graphic is nice, the control is nice, the movements are nice and most importantly it's Vikings we are talking about so not boring at all",5
"Waste of time, any game that ages to explain a storyline and how to do basic things isn't worth playing. If it needs explaining, then it's not worth playing. Deleted after 5 minutes of boredom.",1
I'm beginning to like this game. The graphics are great. I hope the devs can enhanced more to a larger size the graphics so that we can see it much better...,5
"Very unique take on a base builder with the individual workers gathering resources, makes the game a much more hands on experience than waiting all day for resources and such. Graphics are great and gameplay is fun.",5
"It is boring tbh as you have no freedom to teleport where ever you want to go. It's a pay to win. It's got no troop marching speeds, and their zombie game is the same. Wast of your time.",1
Another tribal wars game. This time with bugs and poor interface design. Just released so probably will get better but why should we spend our time on an unpolished game when there are infinite versions of tribal wars ?,3
This game only works if you joined in the first couple of days of a new server or kingdom  starting. Until you join you have no idea of the server situation. I have been playing this game for 63 days and I am very frustrated and thinking of giving up. When I started I got several requests to join a tribe and not understanding the implications of this I resisted. After 4 or 5 days I joined an unknown tribe. It soon became apparent that  there were a lot of stronger tribes around because they star,2
"This game is one the best underrated game that I've ever played! I hope developers will some multi troop squad creation, so that players like me would enjoy and also benefit from deploying multiple squads outside and inside the city.",5
"Dunno what it is, i definitely dont usually enjoy these games. But you guys managed to have my interest and attention here. Pretty neat so far congrats on a great launch and i look forward to seeing what you guys have to offer in the future!",5
"Played for a while and captured a few villages. Got bored though. It's just another city leveling game, nothing really any different. No incentive to keep playing.",3
Cool graphics I guess but it's just a rise of kingdoms clone that's more realistic. So unless you like rise of kingdoms first of all I'm disappointed in you but second of all just play this instead of the original.,3
"The graphics are good yet not best, but the storyline is a very good one. I've always enjoyed the viking era themed games. So far, I've not run into any problems with the game yet, so that is a plus.",5
"Rise of Kingdoms rip off. Over 75% of this game is identical to the other, with a different skin on top. Not even improved on the older game either, Rise of Kingdoms is much more entertaining.",1
"Great game so far. Different than the usual War games, but still see similarities. Overall is worth downloading. Description may change over time.",4
No ads and arrows for when you're stuck . It's free and has great character designs. I love it ! 😃A great game I recommend it.,5
"Fun as! Great CG work. Beautifully crafted. Fun story. Creativly executed, want a game that will entertain all people of all backgrounds... family friendly yet still enough rebel in the game to attract us all. Well done guys!",5
i really like the game but the reason for two stars only is because it lags way too much and then the game will kick me out. it's not fun to play like this it makes me want to uninstall the game.,2
"Another typical pay to win game. Once my little village was eligible for attack, it was pummeled by the high level villages they put me in the middle of. Three days straight of Army being slaughtered and resources stolen constantly is enough for me. GOODBYE!",1
"First I wasn't certain to give the game a try,but now I'm really enjoying especially the weather conditions. Great game,just hope it don't die off after two months of playing it like some other game I played. But really great game give it try.",5
Very great experience. Love the fact it has voice actor's and actresses. Very easy to follow and love the theme.,5
"Game runs poorly, constantly loading freezes. Graphics are good but gameplay is very similar to lots of games out there.",3
"Wanted a change from FoE and so far enjoying it, taking a bit of time to work out everything, one annoying thing after 2 days play I am being asked to buy new things, I want to find my feet before making a Commitment to the game.",4
"Good storyline, excellent graphics but major con is humongous amount of training and upgrade time which makes you lose interest.",3
"Seems like a good game but constant game stuttering & slow. Pop up saying ""frame lag detected"" always coming up and game closes. Quite irritating if u ask me",1
"Love it almost like age of empires but hate that you can't clear/collect any tree, have to do it by zones and only at certain levels.",4
Loved your game but just have one problem it lags like hell and keeps crashing i admit my phone is on the weaker side but still this is way too much lag that shouldn't happen with my phone as i have played higher graphics games smoothly than this.,4
Meh.. all these games advertised about all these battles. They're all the same when you download them you spend more time building your village and micromanaging then battling. If they just did it like the advertisement it would be a great game.,3
The game is fun and I've been enjoying it since a month playing and also the game has a good graphics great fighting. But what I don't like in this game is the game is highly pay 2 win.,4
"It is so detailed, and I never get bored. It is good because you don't have to ever wait long for the upgrades to happen. The upgrades are always awesome, and I always love getting them.",5
It's great because there are no pop ups asking you to buy stuff and you cannot easily grow! It only took me 1 day to grow cheifs Hall to lv 10! I recommend it to anyone bored and can't find the right game to play ▶ (÷,5
"I'm new to this type of game but this one has been easy to learn, fun to play and a good way to pass time. Character design is really cool as well, there's a good amount of variety. Looking forward to continue playing.",5
"The graphics is awesome. I wish units are a little more scaled, units are large compared to the environment.",5
"Fun game, so far, i really hate forced pvp. Would be nice with an option to lock your account to strictly pve, meaning you can't be attacked, can't attack anyone and can't join alliances, that would be fair and both types of players could have fun",4
awesome game but it keeps freezing and glitching bad.and static..please fix this.then this game will be 5 stars easy..its like a computer game..but right now..its impossible to play.very irritating.its so glitchy laggy and full of static..,3
"Wow.. After so many tower defense games I've tried. So far this is the best. IGG been never disappointed their players. From coc, girls game, etc. Always have high quality game. I will play this one for a while until I can figure out all features in game. ❤️❤️",5
I'm pretty new to a game. A friend recommended it to me. It's been really fun so far and I personally think for the type of game the graphics and controls are great!,4
I would like toe give it more stars but the game keeps an lagging on my device and the game it self is a good game but it wont stop lagging and the amount of migth is ridiculously to high to overcome your enemy the enemy keeps on winning,1
"Fantastic, adverts are true and the game is really good and had detailed description and in my aspects is really similar to the Vikings periods as they hunted board and deers slot and the matireals are even more realistic",3
I'm not even in the game 24 hours and I'm getting attacked non-stop by the pay to win people. That's just wonderful. Way to encourage new players. I am uninstalling.,1
"Pretty fun, shows almost everything from the ads which is truly appreciated. Can't wait to see where it takes off from here.",4
"Good gameplay but always unable connect to server. Tested other games and they are working fine, so definitely not data issue.",2
"Timers at start are kind of long if you don't want to spend speedups in begining. Otherwise its beautiful looking game with interesting mechanics. I enjoy the beta , looking forward to what IGG can do with this in future .",5
Fun game I just wish it could give it's players more freedom to choose how and where they expand. With advantages and disadvantages of building in an area of your own choosing,4
Been playing for a few days and have become addicted to it. Great story line and plenty to do in game to keep my attention without having to sit around grinding out builds out. Worth downloading and having a go.,5
Its an excellent master piece but only thing is its stucks when a selecting a skill for 20 level. Player..... Please update it soon and fix all of the bugs....,5
"Cheating is rampant/ many issues I played this game daily since is release. People were buying and selling accounts, using super strong bought accounts to extort resources from teams or completely destroying your progress. You can go to their discord to easily find accounts for sale. Myself and many others reported several accounts with photo evidence, zero action taken. UPDATE: they asked me submit tickets, done twice... no resolution. Game was ruined due to cyber extortion for resources",1
Very buggy black screen legged love the game but just can't play probably will take out all of these things become quite irritating after a while also during black screen music still playing,2
"Honestly the game is great, but they gotta do something about the RSS cost of anything lol. It's quite outrageous. I guess it's still new and needs some tune up but honestly do something about that",4
"A complete game. It's really flawless, it's perfect in every way, it has the smallest details of all strategy style games ✓",5
For the moment seems a great game. I just began with it. Hopefully won't be the same as many games where people that pay money don't let the others evolve.,5
"Playable, but why do developers make you wait a long time for upgrades to buildings or training units. Guess I'm used to PC games that don't make you wait so long.",3
Worst game ever play on mobile. You required two heros to attack on monster but you are provided by only one. For the second you have spent real money. I recommend not to download this game.,1
So far it's a good game. Only wish resources were easier to get kind of hard to upgrade when you can't get or dont have resources to do anything. It's a good game.,5
I do not recommend ! They sign you up for mid game subscriptions without you knowing then take money out of your bank . Then refuse to refund it . It's not just me it has happened to . I've spoken to at least 5 other people in my alliance alone . Everyone tells me it's common .,1
feeling like stronghold game on phone. I like this type of strategy games. you can handle anything and build a big empire. I've been waiting for it for a long time. and now I can play it. 5 stars let's go,5
Yawn....just another boring RTS. 😴 first 20 secs put me to sleep If you like rts games and want to start a fresh one so you have a chance to be top go ahead....otherwise waste of time....,1
"Issues everyday. - Can't port to alliance. Workers can't be assigned. Can't gather resources. Chat window flicks to another channel all the time, even mid message.",1
"Would gladly give it a higher rating, IF I COULD INSTALL IT PROPERLY 😒 Every time I try to install it starts downloading but halfway through just stops 😞 I can't give a higher rating for a game I can't even install much less play. Epic fail",1
"Very linear with no real ""game"". Just do what it tells you. Again basically a clone of every other game with a different theme and lots of paid upgrade mechanics",2
"Been looking for a good Viking game! Tried out others, but this feels fresh. A new gameplay, new mechanics, and beautiful character visuals. Would recommend to anyone looking for new genre!",5
"Hi, the game loads, but once it's finished loading it goes too a black screen. I've waited roughly 30mins too see if it loaded but did not. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, same issue. Please help.",2
"Didn't look like the advertised video. Game has decent ambient music and decent dialog, but it got boring fast for me. No kool cinematic scenes like the video showed. Just a build N Farm Sim.",2
Fun and loads of potential as they develop more content in to the game. Enough to be an enjoyable time killer and keep you interested. So far so good,4
Good mechanics. But the servers are slower than a snail running around the world covered in molasses. Our entire server population is getting discnnected at once because of inadequate servers.,1
Great start but... I just started yesterday and am getting attacked by others already. This is a turn off if I can't build anything up in less than a day,3
"Enjoyed playing this game as graphics were great, but kept cutting out every 9-10 minutes or so. SO ANNOYING , HOPEFULLY CAN BE CORRECTED",4
"There is a bug. When try to learn skill after reaching level 20 , Ivana tells to choose a skil but the the screen freezes. Please fix it.",1
It always freeze when you are typing something on chat then you got to close and open back the game and retype again...and some words are too small to see...its quite frustating to retype again and again..hp easy to get hot and it use lots of hp battery power..thanks,5
"Through mistplay, I get no ads, and they pay me to play. It's the perfect, on the go strategy game you can put down and pick up.",5
Only a couple hours in so far but doesn't have too much p2w yet. Lots to do and well made so will have to see :) Edit: it is absolutely p2w and on a ridiculous scale,1
I have only just started playing but I like the game I shall update my review at a later date. That being said I like the game a fair bit and think that as I play more of it I will be able to honestly and sincerely raise the star rating but more gameplay is needed at the moment. Kind regards from Daniel Harman. Ps. Thanks for a good game.,3
"I played lords mobile for 6 years and this is junk !! If you don't have money this is a giant waste of time !! The whole game is based off money !! No teleporting or shielding for you, unless you can afford it. I played 15 hours over 2 days... if you quit a clan then your stuck on their turf .. so you just keep getting attacked. HUGE THUMBS DOWN !!! 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 This is not IGG gaming this is crapola !!!! Destroy this game and start over !!!! Not fun at all !!!!!!!!",1
"Graphics are great, guides you were to go but still enough independence to do what you like.",4
"Sikk game, alot to do and maybe slightly overwhelming but graphics are great and the gameplay is smooth..... Can't put it down ATM!",5
This game is really fun. Only thing is that upgrading some this in your village can get alittle confusing. But other than that it is a great game.,5
It's IGG so what can I say they didn't fix the bugs that happened on my main account like the events that u get when you first start the game I didnt get that 3 great skins that help our in the long run. So bad the customer service.,2
Intense but interesting and not any ads so far and really not hard to play easy to earn everything though fighting monster are a little challenging at points,5
"Very well designed by creators and developers, I am very interested and excited to find out more in the storyline. Very cool game and I love Norse mythology. Thank you for a great work.",5
"I try to play but always same story. join a group get kicked out of the group while you're sleeping, then get attacked by group. I don't know what it is about this game type but they are great for backstabbing 🫤",1
"I am thoroughly enjoying the game. However, there are to many loading circles. Constantly loading, freezing etc.",3
"For being a freshly release as it is, it's pretty smooth. Very well done on the tutorials. 4 Stars for now because it is still very new.",4
Game keeps on closing by its self I've even put all of the setting to the lowest they can go but other that as my main problem I'm having with the game its still a good game and I would recommend it,3
Amazing game! I have been looking for an awesome viking game that has features of age of empires but all viking! Awesome game and hope to see more updates! I recommend this for anyone that is a viking fan and also the game rewards the players which is great!,5
"This game is absolutely amazing and im loving it but Please can you help the game is lagging and is rather irritating, could you fix it asap I would really like to carry on playing but can't handle the lagging",3
"No ads or annoying pushes for purchase. Reminds me of the early days of Evony online, except in my hand. Accidentally hyperfocusing for three hours is a win for me lol.",5
"Very enjoyable. Music, graphics, story, gameplay are all on point. Very happy with the game so far.",5
FAKE ADVERTISING. I downloaded this game before seeing an advert. After seeing how they were advertising this game with little resemblance to the actual game I uninstalled.,1
"high qualitygraphics, good gameplay, absorbing story line. Quick progression and nocompulsion to spend money.",5
"Great game, but you will kill the game for one reason when players finishing level 16 from here the suffering getting started with rss it's so annoying thing many players I see them left the game for this reason please you have to do something for this.",4
"Absolutely complete garbage. Took 20 minutes to load from playstore, and then wouldn't even open. Total waste of time, developers should line up for crotch kicks.",1
İn game chat should be removel. It's so annoying that I can't remove or hide the chat and the same thing goes to events and special requests. I don't wanna see those on my screen they are just so annoyinggg,3
Really good game so far. Excellent graphics and story line. Lots of things to do while you wait for buildings to upgrade.,5
I would rate it 5 star game if it would stop gltching it's so annoying 😒 sometimes I don't even get to play this game improve this stop these fricking bugs and I know I won't even get to play the game after writing this review so please developers of this game read my message and fix those God darn bugs,1
"Nice looking game...beautiful heroes, lots of upgrades - 1 %, absolutely boring gameplay. Lots of pointless clicks....... Waist of time",2
"One of the best I've ever played, amazing graphics, interesting gameplay, cool characters, monsters, brutal north setting) I didn't expect it could be such fun",5
"I love the game. I linked my account on gmail and tried opening my linked account on PC using bluestacks, but the screen just went black and the game won't run.",5
A littleslow on the graphics and game freezes so often it's frustrating I have an s 22 ultra and have wifi no reason it should lag and freeze. Fun game otherwise,5
I have been having problems ever since the last update. When I tried to speak to the Devs they just keep telling me to reinstall. If you dont know what's going on just say so do try IT Crowding me.,1
Best game ever it has some cool features Like completing a thousands of quests fighting with other territories And making a own empire killing big monsters etc I suggest you to start with Ivor the axe brawler it has more features that I can't count to tell you,5
"Very addictive game, easy to play, graphics are nice, feels smooth. Can be a touch laggy but personally ive had no preblem with it",5
"Brilliant game, been looking for something like this for awhile. Graphics are amazing, looking forward to be playing in the long run.",5
"Please fix the zoom issue, whenever i try to zoom it to my base, the screen goes to other side, plus it's lagging a lot.",2
Since the update seems like the game keeps lagging a bit even tho you put the graphics to low. Needs an update. Cuz both phones IOS and Android the game is lag,4
"Looks good so far , only played 2 days . Graphics are good and story looks as though it's gonna be interesting .",4
Keeping me busy for hours! Love it! Different things to do and keep track off. Very interesting 👌 no ads no inapp purchase .. just gaming 😎,5
you cant play the game it keeps kickingyou off before you even get started it looked like it maybe interesting but until get bugs worked out its a loss,1
Just been playing a couple hours but so far so good good voice characters and story only gripe so far is 8m not an auto fight fan other wise cool game graphics and music are awesome really pulls u in lost t8me lol well worth a look,4
Game is good but too much time required to upgrades....worst part is upgrading military takes too much time...waste of time,1
played till lv.12 then the game decided to kick me out many times. tried uninstall/reinstall multiple times same problem. The game was good up to that point.,2
The storyline is great. Graphics are awesome. Looking forward to seeing this game build and grow.,5
"Really loving this game, stunning graphics and gameplay! The story is pretty good too and the viking atmosphere is mind-blowing! Keep it up devs!",5
"Great game, love it. But it does not load properly. I freezes in the loading screen, and my Internet is working fine.",3
Entertaining game with strategic qualities. Development team are proactive and many special weekly challenges are part of the game! I recommend highly.,5
"This game is amazing, great graphics, fun storyline. I've been playing for 2 days straight and I have no regrets on downloading it.",5
It is very interesting. Quite excitement to play it. Keep you busy non-stop. You have to quit to stop playing.,4
"game it 's great... buuuut if you don t invest alot of money you are just food for whales. I was active at least 4-5 hours per day , I was really close to start investing , buuuuut I saw the huge gap between me and top 100 players . the feeling was good , because my clan (6 th place on 2nd server) was destroyed in less than 24 hours by whales. Long live TGA , you were the best clan in all the games I played in the last 10 years. So sad it ended like this",3
It's a viking/norse pagan approach to the Game of War clone approach. As long as you keep that in mind you know what to expect. It does add new things to the mix.,4
It's fun and very enjoyable,5
So much fun and so fast,5
This is one of the best games I have played but after certain level it is hard to advance as you cannot fight without clan members,3
Reminds me of age of empires.....,5
I just love this game,5
Takes a long time to give rewards or built a structure,1
So much money oriented. Pay or starve - should be name. Don't waste your time here.,1
great keep players busy without looming moments.,4
It is very fun and like the story line,5
Slow in nature graphics can be improved,3
Nice game and nice graphics I injoy the game,4
"Nice game, but keeps crashing.",4
"Fun little strategy game, intuitive and well done. Tutorials are helpful. So far, so good!",5
Righting in the bubble and alltexts are to small,5
Easy controls and fun so far,5
Great game so far but only played 2 hours so time will tell,5
"Beautiful and not boring in this game. So, it was an awesome game.",5
Not l8ke the normal city builders. Not fully unlocked areas in the beginning but heck it's better than others graphics are good,5
Low signal when playing but interesting game,4
Clean nice easy to play no problems yet,5
"It's a lovely game, and not because of the graphics and the characters, but how it relates to my joy over Viking shows, movies,and other games",5
Fun but there really need to take care of the lagging,3
Stop the disturbance out of the city. It always happens that whenever a war starts grafics out of the city starts shake,1
"Nice game ,with potable graphics",4
"To be honest, this game is giving me similar vibe like Age of Empires IV. Never thought I will truely enjoy Mobile games. But Viking Rise changed my mind. Thanks to the Creators of this game. I complain thought that's IMPROVE THE COMBAT GAMEPLAY.",5
I love the building up aspect to it,5
Nice grafics and interesting game play. Dialogue is a little weak at times though.,5
"Nice game, good gameplay, visual side. Let's see if free to play and pay to play options are fairly balanced",5
"the game is good, its like an actual rts, but i lose interest on it, when i see some recharge and battle pass, i know it will be p2w game, i wont mind if its solo player but its a competitive game.",4
This is good and nice graphics,5
what's wrong with this game? After the new update it just stucks. Please do something about that,3
Nice graphics and quality,5
Personally is love this game this game is too op and also graphic are good and game is good i give 5 stars to this game this game is really enjoyed full,5
It's very good game and it has very realistic looking graphics unlike other games. And it is a fun combat game .,4
Love the game play absolutely addicting find myself playing it more than my other games,5
Kind of copy of concept from the game (Ants: underground kingdome). where ants in farrr farrr better that this .,1
I like Vikings and this game is wonderful,5
I'm new but there is so many adventures so I like rpg games like this,5
Great game except for having to research for higher troops,5
A lot better than i expected. Doesn't hold your hand completely. Lets you explore mechanics quite freely. Thoroughly enjoying so far.,5
Good game very balance devs always fix the issue presented,5
"Interesting game concept, good story line",5
"Pay2Win, they want money left and right and the top players are completely whales who spend thousands of dollars and if you're free to play your only 2% as strong as the top players. You will also get bullied with no chance to defend your base",2
it is not updating,1
Great graphics and fun.,5
A great experience of survival and hunting i like it 🎉👊🌟,5
Great game thoroughly enjoyable experience,5
Very interesting and fun.,5
It's a super mind blowing game to play,5
Very interesting game on super game,5
Good game but grafics low piz improve grafics and clearety.u well doing up good sugest in game option,5
Super graphics and this game working very smoothly,5
"Yet another reskin of this kind of ""strategy"" games, where the only strategy is to wait till the building timers fill up and perform some mindless automatic actions in between",1
Really great game. It lags just a little bit and I hope they are working on that small problem. Just started but awesome so far,4
This game is all about money as soon as U run out of resources you have no choice but to spend money because U can't build anything and U will have to wait days and days just to build one building if U don't spend money UNINSTALL IMMEDIATELY p.s I'd love to spit right in the Developers faces for making this game a pay to win and wasting people's time,1
Enjoy playing this game,5
Enjoying it so far not many problems only downside for games like this is having to join a guild I can't play all the time so get kicked out of guilds a lot for inactivity which makes me uninstall most games tbh but this is OK will try to look past the guild thing and enjoy the rest,4
Good game but need more story anfld graphic,5
It's fun it passes time,5
"I like this game alot, but it glitches alot.",3
The lag is making it difficult for me to play the game. Tried to optimzed thru their settings but still lags a lot.,1
The game is amazing,4
I love this game I hope the bug repair it,5
Was a good game until last update..now all I get is constant lag or game freezes and game shuts down..such a shame was enjoying it...won't be playing till it gets sorted :(,1
I played it for 21 hr and i cant stop playing its so good and cool.,4
"I was surprised at how engaged I found this! Usually do not like these types of games, but this one is great!",5
Keeps glitching a freezing everytime!,2
I liked the environment but the action and war is not so perfect in this game,4
I was able to play uninterupted by lagging or gmae just shutting down or freezing for more than 40 min most of the time it would start fine then go down hill within 3 minutes or less,1
Best fighting game in my life.,5
Very nice game,5
Playing for about 48 hours. Ok so far No ads to buy stuff. So we will see,4
Thought it was a good game. But then I see ads for 'this game' that isnt anything like this game. Not gonna play a game that falsely advertises their product.,1
Interesting and doesn't demand money.,4
"I just started , but its really good i feel some originality in the game I've played so many strategic and building management but this one is new.",5
Love this game wroth spending money on,5
"Good graphics but a bit boring and no social network , I was excited about this game but at the end of it all just a .......Big Disappointment ! I have deleted Viking Rise",2
"💯% satisfying, mesmerizing",5
Game is amazing in all aspects but the only problem that irritate me to open the interface.my internet connection is perfectly fine but fail to open.,4
"Early days yet but the graphics, game play, challenges, etc are exceeding expectations.",5
Been on from the start and I must say it has amazing graphics at the beginning there was plenty to do and now it's just well all boring same thing over and over.,2
Very nice adventure game.,5
An okay game you can play with 1 hand simple! A little like myself lol,4
A pay to play type of game. Yeah you can play the boring part for free but if you want to join the events you have to pay.,3
I love it Is litterly the best game I have ever played,5
Very good graphics and very real,5
The music is so relaxing to me plus the game is really virtual and great to play and thanks to gamers at heart for creating this wonderful game as well.,4
It's the best game ever like I have to upgrade ivor and all the other troopers,5
Very enjoyable game. I hope more nice upgrade will happen soon.,5
Just the usual strategic game but dug deeper on details and exploration. Please keep the hard work to make it more interesting in the future.,5
"Nothing new when you compare other games. Same inapp purchases, same logic to build your town while someone comes and raid you. Google play is full of these. Try to create something different.",2
Good graph not really different than other games like this,3
Excited for new patch,4
No bugs no Ads and nice strategy mobile game,5
Very entertaining and easy to use,5
Good way to kill time and pretty fun.,5
Liking this game very much what's not to like about a Viking game so far it's fun and relaxing,5
Good game. Its not like just spend money to be able to play.,5
"So far it seems like a fun chill Viking town/strategy building game, not too difficult, very relaxed. I am enjoying it so far.",5
super fun..i love the game.. graphics are also great,5
Ive really enjpy while exploring this game first,5
Love this game makes me feel like I'm in the viking age skal,5
It is a nice game,5
Hey VR people I have played this game last 2 months but now all chapters are over or now this game is boring and feels not good vibes please devloper i request to you people add some villages and chapters so we have some more tasks so we remember old memories .,1
"Pleasantly surprised, for a free game it doesn't aggressively push micro transactions and the game play loop has been pretty enjoyable.",5
Really good game just like adg of empire 👌 👏,5
"Worked fine at the start ,started lagging after a few minutes and then it started crashing every few minutes.now it wont even load it just gets stuck after loading screen .please fix it ,otherwise looks promising",5
"Would be a good game if top players would let you play, I was level 3 and attacked twice couldn't catch up,if that keeps up you'll never get any others to play",1
Good but has to try whatever I can make out what to do,3
Game is okay. But too much gap from casual and pay to win users. Not fun to play competition is not there.,2
"At first I had a bad opinion on this game, but now that I actually played and seen a lot I like it. The only thing I do not like is that you have to wait soo sooo long for stuff to finish upgrading.",5
This is a real time strategy game and best game ever i played..,5
This game 🎮 is so cool 😎👍 but I'll give it 5 star's if you can train your army offline at least when you are not able to go online that would be great thanks 😊,4
"Gameplay , story are great! Awesome game! But i uninstalled it because on my 6.1 inches screen I cannot see the text . Too bad",3
"I waited to much for the return of IGG games , realy its a huge update in strategy games , i really likes it and it makes me addicted , the keep mobile gaming experience in another level , please keep moving forward ❤️",5
I like the character they looks cool and the the weather looks nice,5
Definitely recommend this one I really loved it and if you have any problem opening it just uninstall and install it(From my experience)and it will be good as new😊,5
"A bit slow, good graphics. Game has Improved alot.its a shame that certain clans are allowed to ""bully"", but I guess that's ROU for you. They are destroying the serve with their antics.",5
Super fun and fun,5
Just starting to learn how to play properly 😀,4
Having problem with help assist button when my clan need an assist button lags out and delay every few mins please fix so far only issue I've noticed since I just started but I'll keep updating,4
Nice and easy to progress,5
"First day playing seems ok...no ads...haven't had the need to make purchases yet, seems to be letting me advance. Good storyline as well",5
Good game to keep u company,4
I love this game I'm entertained for hours even with my ADHD,5
"I Love this culture style game, but the interFace deSign a bit slower & needs a Little touchUp. Can't catch while scrambling on objectives.",4
"Overall good! The graphics are good, the simulations are good. Not so many ads too. This is a fun game.",5
No words fantastic,5
Good gameplay and great graphics,5
At start the game was simple but as the play progressed it started to look a little unclean and hard but still it's good,4
The creater's of this game are very cleaver. They know how to attract people that's why they show good animation when we start open the game. Good job boys.,5
Besides how long it takes for upgrades it's worth it,4
The updates need to be condensed,3
Nothing like the ad they recently started showing to me. It was shown to be like a free Age of Empires style building but IT IS NOT.,1
Very interesting & very exciting,4
"Can't stay app,always auto log out",3
The game seem good but it is unplayable...it keeps logging out every 2 minutes and it runs super slow out of nowhere,1
"The game style and graphics is really nice, but somehow I couldn't log in just this evening *Philippines time* I hope it may soon be fixed..",3
Sad that the developers had yet to realize of their games are nice to play BUT as the text is so small; defeat the fun of playing it.,2
On my device the screen shows a reddish color only I hear only sounds,1
Some guy joined my clan and one of my members promoted him and he demolished all of our tribe flags and I think tribe fort then kicked me and everyone out then disbanded the tribe because R4 members in clans can demote leaders so watch out 1 week playing this game and getting my clan up and powerful just to be destroyed by a random person and it's easy to progress half of the game is unfinished and unpolished.,1
Heavily tilted as P2P. If you are F2P even if you grind you will still be way behind. Good time waster though.. currently 20M in might and CH23 at K10,3
Dis 3d and best game to play thanks,5
The game is so good 👍👍👍,5
"Love the game its realy addictive and fun. I know it down a star because I find the chat window to big and there's no option to hide it, plus shileds feel to expensive",4
"I think the game is good but a few issues..one is a tribe issue whereby you cannot get players to join you and if you form a new tribe it's as good as nothing, make it such a way that new players can join new tribes and not old tribes.",3
Best of the build and battle games but can be confusion and the level up system for your heros just takes way too long,4
Bruh clash of clans is better than this but then also good Most ads come,4
"I enjoy building, fighting, and recruiting soldiers to take over villages.",5
Graphics and realism. Great game! Only thing I dislike is when the freezes up.,3
I removed the game because it does not have Hindi language.,1
"Good game but for some reason it keeps crashing just when u r fighting or doing something important, if also can b very slow , need to sort it out before I leave",3
Viking is the best game in yhe world,5
Have not been able to play for days. It wont load,1
No complaints so far but might be a cash grab. Luckily I haven't gotten that far to be a judge of that. However lots of deals are there like most builder games.,5
A really good game,5
This is a power up game. Like lords mobile and coc.,4
"It lags sometimes but i love this game, the graphics are too ultra , the war , the army , the heroes , evreything is nice!.",5
Good quality. This game is far more enjoyable than the other games i saw. This game is much more on graphics.,5
"Looks good game played for 1 day, I have an issue I don't know my phone is also not bad but I feel like game is choppy or maybe lagging just a bit it seems choppy some performance update on smoothness will be nice",3
Am trying to login but it doesn't work retry retry... Am very upset..,1
Lots of fun,5
Really good game,5
I like all the things I control. It's fun,5
"High Quality game. Enjoying it loads so far, thanks dev team it's epic 😎",5
I was a tribe leader I log in I check mi tribe and I'm rank one some one is now the leader I never made them the leader the game sucks 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡😡why did the game get ruined it was good till this,1
"Like others I like the game, then it suddenly becomes complicated. I will keep going as best I can. Change of mind, good, good game",5
Love the Vikings setup. Takes you back into their world.,5
Gotta love Vikings ..hoorah ..love this,5
It's really good detail after I was finally able to download it :),5
"Joined for few days, so far haven't encountered any issue yet, the graphic is nice, the game play is like age of empire.",5
This is awesome game an easy fix gameplay,4
"Overly complicated. Advances you VERY QUICKLY then slows down suddenly, practically stopping any progress.",2
Very nice game and super graphics... i love it ...,5
Great type of game play so far,4
"This is what iv been looking for, a well story drivin viking kingdom building game with cool mechanics! I enjoy it and im looking forward to playing for a while.",5
This game is great I love it I love playing it my son call me playing one day and now he wants to know how to play it was the only he's only seven he doesn't know everything about it but he's trying really hard and he gets upset when he can't do something it's funny but I love this game thanks,5

Fun game to play. I like it,5
"Just started so this rating is subject to change, but so far so good",3
It's a good game but loading the game takes kinda long so,4
"I just wanted this type of game or gameplay on Android,waited...and got it...!",5
"I really liked it, it's more realistic than C.O.C. no offense..",5
"The game concept is marvelous, what ruins the experience is the p2w system. I know developers must earn somehow, but creating this unhealthy and unbalanced experience ruins the game.",3
I really enjoy the game but ive one problem i cant purchase anything like it brings up the Google thing but wont let me accept it but maybe its a bug but otherwise i really enjoy playing,5
"The game is good, and it is also addicting. The events were great but there's also a problem about the graphics",4
Great game it's good fun so far,5
Very nice game and nice graphics,5
Fairly standard city builder,3
"Can plss reduce the time of building,researching, trainings of soldier it is a waste of time how long we will wait",1
Very good game plus graphics are good should have downloaded sooner,5

Great with the game play and animation,5
Quite addictive and amazing scenery.,5
Good the best and ngl the graphi are wonderful and unique tho,5
"Love it, like strategy games. Well done..👍👍👍👍😎",5
Game extreamly boring as u do task the games played out boring plot etc eve. With battles u are out numbered as 5he system gives toy no way in hell to icrease your troops to win and quickly level up eve the rewards suck,2
"Demn good game i really like this game too much fr , highly recommended to play and get powerful, download rn",5
Downloaded it a couple days ago and got a few hours into it and so far I really like the gameplay and graphics and really no major lagging.,5
Good game sonar. Nred tonadd a town button sonnet swiping to get back to town,5
Don't bother downloading this game I got up to level six and when I went back to play it I went back to level zero after it taking me awhile building up just to after start over and over 😞😞😞😞,1
A cookie cutter civic/battle game like alot of others. Research trees and such that you will be familiar with most likely. That said it is well executed. The annoying thing personally is there is not a trace of nordic accent anywhere and terms like honey Hall rather than mead.,4
It's good the graphics is good the heros are good everything 👌,5
This is quite good online game,4
This is fun,4
"Good game, nice calm enjoyment, that's what you can expect 😉",5
Best adventures and world building game I have ever seen,5
too early to ask for feedback,5
This is a good game but the further you get in the more time you have to spend,3
"This was a great game until it just turned into a PvP, pay-to-win game. Way to put out yet another ""same old game"", developers. Uninstalled 👎",1
Love this game,5

It is about norse and u get to explore the world by fighting and u have to have the right amount of Vikings to kill wolfs boars and niflheim creatures,5

"This game is amazing, It has good graphics and nice story. I recommend to put better stories!",5
Interesting n fun,4
Graphics are amazing good game to play,5
Fast and easy simple,5
Fix the bullies! Some higher player will repeatedly attack your village in just an hour. Should have shield automatically when you lose to prevent bullying.,1
Love this game,5
"loading loading loading then crash LOL, uninstall",1
The worst game in world my wifi connection is also there but when i do something is take lot of time to load 100 time it was getting laoding loading loading please donot download this game I give one star because his graphics and modes are good but this game is very bad 😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔,1
The game is so good and smooth with so many options to survive and make resources you dont have to pay for anything. If just the company can add arabic language Thank you,5
I think this have a few distinct derection not too manny other options !😃,4
"Stoey driven, lots to do. Turns pvp after a town hall becomes level 8. Small font, hard to read on a phone.",4
Things are taking too much time really too much. But game is interesting. I love adventurous games.,4
It is just a beautiful game it is well made and it has a great story,5
This is very good for to play,5
Should have downloaded this in the first place it's very addictive,5
Great game.... A beautiful simulation,5
It is a nice game with very descent graphic,4
Gameplay is not smooth and definitely not unique...looks like a copy of rise of kingdoms and land of empires..games are no longer made with passion nowadays...,2
Fun and interesting!,5
Very fun to play I sat down and played for hours,4
This is my first time playing it and its really good😁,5
Nice game style but it will be good if you can help other workers to build some facilities or level up some facilities. Just my opinion,4
"So far so good, graphics and back story for single player it's outstanding. Might change stars along the way but overall I'm impressed 👌",5
"first of all, this game is really the best... the graphics are cool... the chapters are interesting... it's easy to play :D",5
Nice game Viking rise,5
Good game but i refuse to pay for upgrades,5
Love this game,5
Love this game,5
The Ads for other devices force you to the appstore without permmision. There is a chance you could download accidentally.,1
Its a very good game,5
"Y'know it's like other games I've played and it's about what you would expect, not a complaint. Infact, I rather like these type of games. Everything is fine, nothing majorly bad about it, there are of course a few flaws. But that's to be expected, and it's nothing serious. Yeah uh, it's good 👍 😊",5
One of the best strategy games.... Make it like BGMI,5
Good game. I do love Norse/Viking things.,5
This game is the best I've been playing 4hours none stop I suggest it to anyone,5
Decent base building game for mobile,4
"Same basic gameplay of city building, nothing new",4
It's was fun early but when players with millions might attack you because ur still weak so they gain kill points,1
"Awesome game, I love the game play",5
"If you haven't tried playing it, you're missing out. Give it a try, trust me, you won't be disappointed",5
Love the app it's good if you are boring and looking for a game to play here is the game viking rise,5
Fun to play awesome graphics easy to comprehend five stars people that look at the rating you should download the game and try it out.,5
It's fun but it gets boring real quick,4
An upgrade of classic open world games,4
Lovely wait or pay strategy with tons of stupid dialogs. It's been a pleasant hour (or less). Uninstall and forget.,2
Crashes while still loading data,1
Im starting to get bored unlike the other games that you handle theres a lot of new events unlike this one where the events are just vice versa😐.,3
Just over all the best civilization games and the most realistic viking game,5
Getting used to music wish I could turn off can't seem to find out how 😆,4
It'd been wait for a long time but it's okyy,5
It's so good because you get a building's strat away,5
No one should play this game pay to win and the developers are making there own clans with high power to attack others. If I could give less then a star I would.,1
The game it self is beautiful but I'm not sure if it's a mmo or if I'm all alone lol but it's fun all the less feels a little lonely were is the clans the war the crazy idk just yet tho the wars have just begun after all see you in game,5
Great game lots of fun,4

"Rules are not followed by players. Game controllers do nothing about it. Racial slurs, profanity, bulling other players. Game is a complete joke, they can't control or want to do anything about it. They all the one's that pay the most to do whatever. I'd tell you not to even bother with this game. The high rating is only coming from the one's that pay the most.",1

Cookie cutter fake strategy game. Forces you into different servers. Deletes current progress. Just one of the worst games I've tryed,1
Too much lag i can't even play for 5 minutes,2
Too linear of a path through story. I got bored after twenty minutes. Uninstalled.,1
Yeah gameplay is very good bu i have one small suggestion if you could make somehow more optimal verision of this game beacuse i don't have very powerful phone but anything other than that it's a great game keep it up,5
Game is ok but 3 level map enemy high power. I am play 4 .5 days but no kill that enemy,2
Game is awesome but you should add that you have horse and you can ride with it anywhere,4
"When city destroyed, very expensive to recover. Not possible to get so many resources... or you have to pay...",1
"Fairly easy play, a little glitchy and I don't think it's my phone!",5
"Stupid game, you need to do exactly the game says or else there's no way out. Keep training loop no loot whatsoever you must use gems to go forward",1
So far so good. I just need a phone with more ram.,5
It is best game in mobile and pc.,5
Great graphics and intense game luv it,5
I love it 💗💓 I am recommend this,4
Overall great game! It allow you to speed up your build progress based on the worker!!! Isn't that amazing!!!,5
"Loving the game so far. Lots to do, graphics are fantastic, and the story is great.",5
"Really good game, and it makes time go by fast",5
Very great game,5
Game frozen. Even deleted and reinstalled and froze at the same spot.... Sad cause I've been waiting for this to come out.,1
Just started out and I already love the graphics and the gameplay! Can't wait to see what future contents they'll bring!,5
Decent gameplay easy to learn,3
Yet another update. Although scheduled over running again. Message saying update finishing in 1 hour. Checked back after an hour found new message saying update finishing in 1 hour 5 mine.,2
Its a very intresting game keep up the good work,5

No option to play vertically.,3
Wow very cool graphics,5

This game is good you can attack the real others player you can unlock other hero then you can build sa wall and there's more you can get gems for mission like 100 2×10 diamond and 500 or 1000 or even 20000 for mission 💖💖💖👌👈,5
I am enjoying this game,5
"It's amazing, i really love the quality of the game.",4

The game is great but after the new update i cant seem to get inside the game.,2

Very nice game,5
Too many lapses. Loading half the time.,4
"Familiar enough to know what I'm doing, different enough to find highly enjoyable. So many things to do that I'm not bored. Recommending to friends.",4
Cool graphics and fun to play,5
It is really fun but the fact you have to go through 9 CHAPTERS of a tutorial just to do the fun stuff is kinda boring,4

This games is no matter how many try i tried i can reach high level my hall is lvl 16 but my power is not reach 100000 but the other play they reach more than that but they have the same lvl hal us mine i dont understand,1
Didn't expect it to be that good. Super fun. worth playing,5

To control some of the features is hard is would work better with a mouse n keyboard rather than a mobile game but the games not to bad,4
Great gaming experiance,5
This game is nice,5
Just like usual RTS games but theme vikings. Im giving advice you should add GvG like wolf game: wild animals wars. Law of jungle is kinda boring and hard to get Ivana shard. Need a years to max her out.,4

A game for psychotic bullies - plz avoid unless you're a psychopath. The devs let just 2 tribes completely dominate - and they revel in driving players not affiliated to either of those teams out of the game. By all means find this out for yourself - but you'll only be wasting your time and money. A vile game for vile people.,1

"Bad summoning experience, i prefer one legendary at the beginning ,of my choosing to be unique but everything is the same as everyone else's",3
Actually kinda fun. We'll see if it stays that way or if I run into too many cash walls to progress.,5
"Fun game, it's the Vikings form of The Walking Dead lol.",5
Lagging crashes slow loading good game just not worth the lagging slow engine fix and make better the lagging and ill think of re-downloading,2
Great rts with a story too!,5
it's better than i expected. great job team.,5
Downloaded the app 500 mb +.but cant play says my device not compatable should let me know before i waste my data ?plz make a effort so i and iam sure many others can play the game .i have a android mid field tablet.thank you.,1
"The game was fun until I uninstalled the game, then I downloaded it and I have to restart all over.",1
Personally I love it. It's like other strategy games but it feels different in a good way,5
"THE GAME IS FUN GOOD ENTERTAINING, YET I HOPE THE GAME FILES CAN BE MOVED TO EXTERNAL STORAGE IT EATS 1GB IN INTERNAL STORAGE. FOR A LOW END DEVICE THATS A HUGE THUMBSDOWN, BECAUSE IT FORCES US QUIT THE GAME OR FPS EXTREMELY DROP TO 5 - 10.",4
"Your game can be played by anyone with money, no skill required The resources required to play the game or grow yourself are not possible without money in this short period of time.",2
Not sure if I'll come back to take this off but the game is so buggy i can't even get past the tutorial,1
Extremely pay to play. Trying to nickel and dime us to for everything you need to do in the game,1
Bring more updates sonner....there are many things including the taming area...that has no be implemented yet...bring more cool updates sonner,4
"The trailers do not depict actual gameplay, gsmeplay is just a generic multiplayer strategy game",1
Really great game the graphics are awesome you guys should try it out,5
Such a story of vikings one day i am boared and start watchinf Vikings series i watch 1st season and my interest in vikings are very good i watch all seasons in just 3 days than i start Vikings rise game,5
i enjoy this game,4
"Similar to games like ""Rise of kingdoms"" except you don't start with a million power ups and 50000 power and infinite resources, you start small and work your way up like you should.",5
Slow start but interesting,3
This was amazing game,5
Did not enjoy it. It was far-fetched and has a ridiculous story line. Game designer has no concept of what a viking truly is.,1
This Game is very cool.my request will give me Hero power up token.it is my very requested. I want from your company.,5
"Nothing like advertised. Portrayed as first person survival with amazing graphics, total rubbish.",1
Love this when I play i am remembering viking in real this is fantastic 😍,5
Not a bad game bit slow and jumps around abit needs to be a bit clearer sometimes hard to make out what's going on,3
"Great five times!! Gameplay , design , mechanics , units ,it is unique !!Congrats !!",5
This is a fun game. Easy to catch onto.,5
Amazing game after Rise if Kindgdomes,5
Very cool game is fun to play,5
It good but it's slow on my phone,4
"I really like this game. Graphic is super nice, storyline is immersive. A must try strategy war game.",5
Very optimal design and the best interfaces yet hoping for more modifications and details too in the near future,4
Love this gameb,5
This game is asome,5
It's just fun,5
Very nice game,5
"Nice game, I love to play it more and more",5
"Pay to Play, no system in place to stop bullies from crushing you. Within the First week of playing a Korean Clan already had 15 million power players, one guy was at 32 Million!!! Mostly everyone else at that point is still bellow 500k!!!! They attacked Every tribe in the server and forced everyone to Disband their clans, total Dictatorship with one clan ruling all. If you don't have literally THOUSANDS of dollars to spend, don't even install the app!! Could be fun if there was a cap system!",1
So far so good. Minor bug. Restart game resolved it. Need more playing time to determine true rating. Only 3hrs in,5
"fun game, would be better if it had different camera views, not just from the top down, but otherwise, very good.",4
"I dig it, kinda like Rise of Kingdoms",5
It is very nice game. Plesae try this game and play,5
I never received any legendary heroes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I want to refund !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"If I would get a chance I would rate it a -1 million stars bcs this stupid game deleated my army people and resources like meat, wood, and most of all army people I don't know why it did it but it sucks. The person who is reading this comment and is going to download it pls don't do it u will feel very upset after u have gone too far and ur progress gets deleated for nothing.",1
What a wonderful game. I like it. Just wondefull,5
"Good game. It's easy to play even though it gets a bit tougher. Pretty quick, I was looking forward to it, and if you love vikings, then this is the game for you.",4
Fake reviews giving it 4-5 stars? Nothing new and heavily pay to win. WITHIN 2 days players are already million times more powerful due to heavy unrestricted spending. Good for millionaires I guess? Black Card only.,1
"Just starting out on this game. It seems good thus far. A few glitches here and there. I'll return to review later down the line, after some time has passed.",4
So far I'm pleased. I like the graphics.,5
Amazing game play takes $$$ though,5
"It's pretty fun for the first few days. After that, whip out your cash if you want to get anywhere!",1
Nice excellent game,5
Good game so far,5
Very Cool it's all about strategies,5
This game is like a rise of kingdom but better,4
It's very addictive and enjoyable,4

"Graphics are on point, it could be more fun to see if the action and amount of your earned army attacks or clash",4
It's fun so far.,4
"When I can log on and avoid the lag, this would be one of the best strategy game I have played o7",5
👍🏻nice work creative team,4
Very nice game,5
"Enjoyed the game, there is always something to do , i understand that its a new released game so there is few bugs but it don't affect the journey",5
I swear this game Is amazing,5
Most addictive game,5
"Really not sure what games like this are all you do is tap and wait no gameplay or tactics at all lmao 🤣 people sayingnits like aoe or cov are tripping. You tap the screen wait or pay then something gets done , zero strategy zero gameplay",1
Your game is full of hate and bullies especially server 2! Like the hell its 3 tribes against one tribe?! Like how do you measure it?,1
It's cool and fun but I don't know what else to say so.,5
I played it just for a little bit and I couldn't even get a chance even get a chance even to find out if it was even a wonderful game it could was have trouble logging in to the game,2
Best tunnel vision game.,5
Nice game 👍 Viking river and the other day,5
"So far so good, graphics are beautiful, there are lags here and there but I like it!. Can't wait to see what it has in store as I grow in the game!",4
Played lords mobile for years and now having this Vikings version of it makes it all refreshing....soo far loved the experience. overall a good game loved it ❤️,5
Love this game,5
I am being really honest right now ok the game is awesome but when it turns to night time it glitches night to day really fast can u fix that please,4
Very interesting game very nice features,5
I love that the characters are voiced instead of having to read everything. Makes it alot more enjoyable.,5
For first glance it hasn't disappointed me yet. The UI is neat and the game feels clean.,5
Good game to help pass the time,5
This is way better than any strategy game I have ever played. I can't keep a lot of games on my phone because I find them boring after a day or two but this game keeps me busy and I enjoy it a lot.,5
Fun game played it for a while. Check it out.,4
Awesom game mind blowing story loving it,5
Very nice game,5
So far pretty enjoyable but I suspect it gets difficult and a lot of time consuming. Pvp is fun with a clan.,5
Laggy at times still love it,4
Was fun to play. In order to play I have to go through and play store to play. The icon disappeared from my phone.,4
It's a good game but is very time consuming,4
"Pretty interesting game. Would love if we could build defenses, use our army defensively. Would live for an Ai raid on my base to occur.",5
Hi graphics game many hero and so on,5
This is a good game it is the best game in this genre,5

Best game for you village and country,5
I've been playing for the past month or so I got the APK from the official discord and this game is amazing. I can't wait to see what else gets added. This game has A LOT of potential!,5
You guys always ask for rating too early. I just started playing this game. Maybe ask again after a week or two 🤔,2
Nise graphics but the game like hundreds another games like this. Like shelter or zombie surviver e.t.c I expected much more from the game...,2
Awesome gaming for Android. I love much it😀🤩👌,5
Cool game and graphics,5

Amazing games but too much IAP,5
"Great game, easy to play",5
Normal hero/ city builder resource gathering game. I enjoy viking lore so that's a plus. Likely will be p2w but haven't encountered it yet.,4
I love i love it so much,5
3 star for now because I'm testing this game so far the graphics is cool and the battle system is nice too i recommend this game.,3
Nice game to learn strategy,4
It's to hard to find resources..also when you get attack game is over no chance of getting resources when all troops are dead ..,1
the game is good but every 10 mins or less the game will crash and while im playing the starts to lag i hope u could fix it,3

Marvellous..more fun like age of empire,4
Best simulation game by far. The last time I enjoyed this type of game was during the days of windows xp,5
"Unable to delete account. Ridiculous. I have even talked to the customer service and she said, (I quote) ""a gentle reminder to you that we are entertaining your request out of courtesy and not a guarantee of fulfilment"". Just received an email saying I cannot delete my account.",1
Nice graphic & storyline,5
Love it it's fast it's exciting and you don't have to wait to long for your buildings to be done also you get random free power ups so i recommend it,5
"It is good so far , lots of innovative features, tribe management is good,will update once I played for a while",5
Fun to play,3
It's okay I love the city building and I feel not enough games do it like this but in general this game is just a copy paste of rise of kingdoms 4 stars at most,4
A True Viking Experience Game!,5
Server takes too long,1
Best Viking game so far,5
I just started playing this game and this feels incredible,4
Best game like age of empires Everything is on single map. Not scene changing like other games.,5

"Fun war strategy game. Build, train, employ, and hire your leaders. Train your troops, and set out to conqueror your land. Set in the Era and historial setting of the Vikings you will deal with all the issues of a Viking chieftain. The question is will you be victorious or go down in defeat!",5
Need some improvements but still good,5

It's ads always come and show gameplay when I was working in a project 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 why why this game is made !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Worstttttt,1
I really enjoy this game. Good graphics and game play. Time flys while playing this game,5
"I saw an ad on it, I wanted to try it out but when I pressed the install button it did not install. I pressed again and again!",2
The game is rlly gd I like how you can get you own resources in the game and the graphics are rlly gd as well keep up the gd work,5
Bugs problem not smooth i can feel it when the game is running im playing in Snapdragon 855+ still this game laging otherwise good,4
Its a real masterpiece.only problem is that if u have lots of recources then a really strong player like 1M atack power u cant defend and they will take everything from you.then u gotta grind over and over to get where u were and then u will be atacked and again left with nothing so thats a little bit boring.,3
"Would have given five stars, if the combat system was more realistic.",4
This game is not good I don't like it I think I will play like pubg or by my hand but without control and also can't see your army how they are fighting,1
Nice to play and good graphics. I like this game because i can feel the viking villages.,5
Very good game graphics are good I don't see any problem with this game It may be the best game I've ever played if I was you l'd download the game,5
game plays but all i see is a green screen and nothing else ps i see the lady and the viking potrait top left but nothing else sorry!,1
Finally I find a game that is so much enjoyable but also we can talk & make friends with foreigners. 😊,5
Fun so far. Hope there aren't outrageous purchases required later to continue playing,4
"I've only played for a day and it is very fun, definitely would recommend. Thank you TheDooo",4
"Good game would definitly recomend playing,reminds me of a better version of how King of Avalon used to be before it was changed",5
I like the game very much. Easy to follow and free to play friendly.,5
Good game but same as always takes to long upgrading and building things gets boring fast,2
Great game but you get stuck and have to purchase... Still has some bugs,3
"What kind of game that has small space to download, but doesn't want to enter , fix your stupid , quality game",1
"Really good game, but the servers and engine make it unplayable!",1
First day of playing. Not too bad. A little more information about what you're doing would be helpful though. Will continue to play.,4
Bad game .. there is no any recourses to get supplies and there is alot things in game must change,1
"Good game, but there is problems with procesis. Long losd times.",4
Won't install and not but enough of a program to fill the phone. Do better!,1
truely love the game have nothing bad to say......only improvement perhaps if possible that the shields are not so much,5
Great game! Keeps me entertained for hours! Great game! Hours of entertainment.,5
"It's very good game, but need to be improvement and fixed the lag of the game",5
I wish gathering resources was a little more straightforward. Fun game though!,4
This game is awesome!The graphics are look so realistic..this developers needs an oscar😉✌️,5
Danm I got the ad to this game like 2 hours ago but I'm glad I got it game is super fun thanks for making it and have a great day,5
"Honestly, the game is so intriguing that you will not be able to resist yourself from playing this. Amazing!",5
Too much lag.. short story mode .. nothing to do after complete the story,2
"Instructions are clear even if writing is very small, which is why I have only given 3stars.",3
"Not as good or fun as lords mobile and doomsday. It's still good, it's just that nothing steps out in it",3
"Not much of a mobile gamer, but i like theme and enjoying game so far.",5
Like the fast pace of game play its not difficult but still challenging,5
One of the worst games for pay to play ive ever seen get to level 16 you may as well start paying t5 troops 72 days research for instance what a joke,1
Great game and awesome graphics for how the game was built and put together,5
Won't load on my tablet. I tried 4 times. So guess you get one star. But it looks cool.,1
It is a really fun adventures and survival game.,5
Great game but not same as the advertisement I really wish they didn't all mislead,4
"Good grapic, many resourceable, not complicated, good story, no bug",4
When I start playing it's so hard to put it down I just want to keep playing and playing and playing for it is such a busy game,5
"Actually enjoy following the story and animations for once on mobile, great game",5
"Has a great story line, and seems easy to figure out",5
I built a very large army then they did some sought of upgrade and I lost them all.,1
Fun game need alot of space cuz it's slow ND freeze my phone but I still play lol.,5
Game is boring and awful. Based on the ad I expected more,1
This is game was awesome but one fault was training for troops are too long time 😐,4
Great game kept crashing so that's why I don't play no more but was good except for that.,5
Nice game but it should be like open world but it should not be small screen,5
"Fun game so far, but will come back and update my review when I have played it for a few days.",4
"Initially it's good but after couple of weeks play, it's totally boring..",1
Same old boring gather and spend resource game with different age characters...,1

Ok game needs to ofter more in missions and power ups . U need to pay money if u want to get higher bit off a catch wit it,3
"Another P2W game like state of survival and even worst, 1 guy can wipe an entire 67 member tribe. I suggest to don't waste your time on it.",1
So far a great game. Lags a bit and freezes sometimes but its new so.,5
It's super cool and easy to play you can train your own army and defeat enemy's,5
Graphics needs a little touchup...better battles ..my crusader stronghold..or the olympys gods..better combat would be nice,3
It's fun so far. I like that they talk to you as it's under for me to read the small letters.,4
Great game.. I like the environment of the game. The atmosphere is calming and relaxing.,5
Easy to play with pointers to guide you and the graphics are breathtaking,5
You should not be able to attack a player over 100 times to steal all resources make a timer for the ones who can't pay to the top,1
"Just started and it's okay so far, except for the emoji that appear and ruin the look of the game",3
The game is boring because it focuses more on building things up instead of playing a game.,1
I have played many games similar to this one. I absolutely love this game. Thanks to everyone involved in the creation of this wonderful game. Keep up the great work!,5
Ayeah keep it up guys i love this game This is more beautiful than rok and koa. I hope i can join the developers so i can submit my ideas about this game,5
Developers have done the exact same thing as Rise of Kingdoms but Rise of kingdoms is much fun to play.,3
"So far, good game play, nice graphics, and story has been good. So for now 5 stars",5
The loading circuit is very annoying and take a long time and each step there's a loading circle,1
Excellent game and graphics. Story play is awesome and Land expansion is pretty good.,5
May i complain ? The design characters so beautiful...but they way when walk or run & also to press any menu kinda glitch,3
There are some lagging issues but overall it's been a rather enjoyable experience for me,4
"i love this game.it has its flaws,but the quality and art direction are fantastic.",5
It's good game but it needs to fix the lag... The lag is really big problem,3
Can you just fix lag in this game so much drop fps add optimisation for this game (game is good but can't play with lag),1
I like this game the players are cool and you can upgrade your land the more you do the more might you get,5

"Very good game with perfect graphics 👌 keeps you always interested ""IT IS SIMPLY AWESOME ""😍",5

It's a good game but becomes unplayable very quickly if you don't want to spend money,3
"I'm a newb... easy to navigate, easy orientation and superb game so far...",4
From first moment on wards it's pay pay pay ! This is greed on a scale I've never see . Think you guys need to ware mask's and a hooped jumper and a sack saying swag?. It's truly an outrageously expensive stay away people you've been well warned. The star is because I have to give at least one so take it as minus 1.,1

"So far enjoying it, only issue is low number of basic resources",4
"I delete this game after 2 weeks.. Thing that i dont like about this game is that no matter how hard you try to claim resources and upgrade your city, it can be over in one minute.... This was my situation: I was attacked by player who is too higher lvl than me ( he had might about 2,5 million points, and i had only 100k), he stole all my resources and burn my city to the ground... This was not fair at all in my oppinion, but admins let that happend.. So, dont waste your time on this game....",1

"Whales ruin this game, played for a week before I met our dictator yujin of kindom48 I didn't even he 400k might before he board wiped our tribe. My biggest issue is that he has dropped over 10000$ on the game. So I'm going to say this if someone puts down that kind of money should not be in a kingdom with ppl who don't put down more then 100 also telling ppl that they are not allowed over 1 mil power or he wipes you out. This game was fun but I'm not starting over just for it to happen again",1

"I LOVE this game and I LOVE my tribe mates. HOWEVER, I HATE bullies and my entire server is OVERRUN with them. The top 10 tribes are just the same tribe and it’s syndicates and they bully u and relentless attack u until u join their clan. Having to keep a shield up so ur city doesn’t get attacked but then if my troops are out gathering they can still be attacked. There should be more balance to the servers and give a PvE option. I wouldn’t have continued as I have. And Customer Service is a joke",1

I hate their ads i wouldn't play it 😡🤬😡🤬⚔️,1
I was prepared to give this 5 stars. This game is amazingly fun. I was actually going to spend money. BUT then i saw theres a kill point leaderboard. That promotes bullying and whales with mommies credit card. Im watching right now as a lvl 22 with 8mil power attacks those of my clan . He just hit someone that was lvl 9 with 200k power. Another person about to quit because IGG doesnt care at all if people enjoy and stick around. This is exactly why these games and kingdoms die. Goodbye IGG.,1

سازندگان این بازی ربات هایی در بازی قرار داده اند که بدون وقفه در حال استخراج منابع هستند، از طریق دیسکورد از شما پول دریافت میکنند تا منابع را در اختیار شما قرار دهند. این روش درآمد زایی از کشور های تحریم شده هست و باعث میشه به گوگل پلی و اپ استور هم پولی پرداخت نشه. بنظرم نیمی از بازی ربات شده و بدون پرداخت پول نمی‌تونید از لول ۲۲ عبور کنید و همیشه بازنده هستید. پس وقت خودتون رو تلف نکنید,1
"Хорошая игра, но пока ботов не уберут для китайцев, играть там смысла нет. Бесконечные ресурсы для них это не радует",1
Jaime bien le jeux ya la vibrations et moins goûteux et ya du mini jeux sur prope tribu à réglé...I like it and the graphics 😎 big up,5

"Ini game bagus sebenernya, tapi masalahnya saya 2 kali main dan 2 kali main ulang. Setiap kali login saya harus main ulang lagi, padahal sudah di koneksiin ke akun google. Tanya ke CSnya, infonya tidak bisa pulihin akun dari akun google yang terkoneksi. (jadi koneksi ke akun google buat apa?). Dan ini yang ke-2 kalinya, jadi males mainnya, karna harus ulang lagi. Saya gak tau ini game punya server untuk simpan data permainan penggunanya atau tidak.",1

بهترین بازی دنیا عشقم استراتژیکی. دمتون گرم حرف نداره. پیشنهادم به بقیه اینه که نصب کنید معتادش میشین!,5
خیلی گرافیکش پشم ریزونه ،، فقط زبان فارسی نداره و یکم سخته برای ما ایرانیا و ایراد دیگشم فیلتر بودن برا ما هس و ایراد دیگشم اینه ک با نت ایران یکم دیر گاهی اوقات جواب میده,5
@ir_viking_rise ایرانی اگر هست بیاد این گروه تو تلگرام یه کلن خفن داریم میزنیم توی کینگدام جدید گروه تکمیله به ما بپیوند تا قوب تر بشیم اصلا هرچی فارسی زبان هست بیاد بمولا دمتون گرم,5

انها لعبة رائعة ولكن قمت بمسحها لانني تفاجأت بشيء كارثي. عندما قمت بفتحها اخر مرة قبل مسحها . كيف تنتقل قيادة التحالف الى شخص اخر غيري بدون علمي وبدون تدخل مني؟؟ هذا شىء اغضبني بالفعل.,2
Sounds Amazing. Only problem is it doesn't Download lol. Think its a waste of time just like other waste Games,1
بیش از اندازه آپشن و جزئیات به درد نخور تو بازی داره که اصلا به کار نمیاد... ضمنا متاسفانه در کشور ایران بدون فیلترشکن این بازی کار نمی‌کنه.,1
"Quase perfeite, ele fecha sozinho além de ficar travando. Alguns dirão que o problema está no celular, mas ja joguei jogos mais pesados e com resolucões melhores e mesmo assim não travou, O jogo é ÓTIMOOO!!!!..... só tinha esse comentário😀",4
"Es un juego divertido pero casi no hay gente, avancé muchísimo y rápido y jamás me atacó nadie. Muy vacío el juego",3
Lo veo muy sin sentido la fiebre de guerra entendería que no te deje ponerte escudo pero teletransportar ya esta de locos jaja y ahora metieron un límite de cuanto puedes saquear por día estas bromeando verdad? Desinstalo es lo mejor de nada sirve pagar para tener una ventaja si se cargan la ventaja👍,1
العنصرية دخلت حتى لهذه اللعبة كيف لا و قد تم طرد اي احد له اسم عربي و يتحدث لغة العربية من احد القبائل حيث امر بطردنا و قال لأحد اصدقائه اركل محمد خارجا ملاحظة لم يكن اي احد اسمه محمد في القبيلة,1
This game is really good 👍 I am now Vikings in how to train your dragon movie 🐉 I really want to tell you that I am not able to you and your family a very happy birthday Bhai h uski jab k liye nikl gya m hsp k liye nikl gya m hsp k liye bhi kr lo tum kaam kar lo tum kaam h bhai ki shadi nii krre to the kya wo to tujhse puch lena call krk isiliye nii aye hm nii h ki wo to kl yaha par pehle hi rehte,5
Hardly any adds. Decent build times. Really fun,5
I want to love this game but it gets rather boring. :(,3
