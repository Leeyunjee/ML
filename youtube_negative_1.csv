"The globalists control all these terrorist groups. This is the globalists attempt to get a Mideast war going with Iran. Problem, reaction, solution. The Hegelian dialectic is being used by the global criminal cabal to bring in their dystopian control state."

Fake news. <br>The world knows the truth
Hostages arent going to save Hamas.
Are Palestinians stlll dancing in the streets chanting Allah Akbar &amp; and celebrating their baby killing rapists?
They need to level the entire country of palistine.

"Hamas and hezbollah terrorists need to be told. If you execute the hostages,  when you are killed, your body will be fed to the pigs. No paradise for you"
The democrat party needs to claim responsibility for sending billions of dollars to Iran who was the sponsor of this attack
Are Egypt opening up the border to take Palestinians? NO. Is the Arab world opening its arms to take Palestine refugees? NO. Have Palestinians ever accepted any offers of two state solution?. No. Did they vote for Hamas. YES . Did they cheer as their terrorist political wing beheaded children.  YES . Did they cheer as 6000+ rockets were fired into Israel cities YES. <br><br>Enough is Enough. Flatten Gaza.
"PALESTIAN COMETEU UM ERRO, NAO  ter antiaereas..sabendo q israel atacaria pelo a r,,"
Baby killers vs baby killers. Is this suppose to be the new type of war?
"Israel attacks the Gaza Strip every day without any media attention. However, when Palestine attacked Israel, all media trends around the world began to look at Israel to the point that they left Ukraine, which is fighting the most powerful country in the world. This indicates the extent of Israel&#39;s influence around the world. Indeed, Israel is the one who moves the United States, and the United States is the one who moves the rest of the world. This is due to the Red Indians who were wiped out from the planet, and the same thing Israel does to Palestine. Both of them are criminals."
israeil is committing atrocities against pelstenian in ghaza.

Then he said to them: “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes, and in one place after another food shortages and pestilences; and there will be fearful sights and from heaven great signs."
"If you live in Gaza and Hamas is lobbing rockets into Israel from your neighborhood, better go to another neighborhood. Better yet, let your voices and actions against your terrorist friends be heard for once. These idiots will get you all killed...."
Theyve been fighting over that land for thousands of years taking it from each other back and forth who knows who it really belongs to....theres always been tension over there..why would Americans be comfortable going over there?
"Erase Gaza in South Israel,  Islamic Terror supporters move Gaza 2 SyriaLebanon border. Stop funding HAMAS, HEZBOLLA, ISI, LeT, ISIS,JeM, BokoHaram build new Gaza 4 Palestinians North of Israel."
ISREAL needs to wipe Hamad out even if civilians die.  They are a true evil
Biden?? Really? joey?
Israel <b>only</b> attacks buildings containing <b>terrorists!</b><br>People who aren&#39;t <b>hosting</b> <b>terrorists</b> in their house shouldn&#39;t be worried.
When Hamas decides to release the poor innocenent Israeli hostages the siege will be removed!<br><b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>simple!</b>
Either our presidents do too much or not enough. They cant win
Both sides are effing tools. Nothing sickens me more than men willing to put children in the crossfire.
SO IT&#39;S OK THAT ISRAEL BOMBS CIVILIANS IN GAZA? BARBARISM TO COMBAT BARBARISM. Where is your common sense? WHY don&#39;t you cover the children killed by Israel bombs in Gaza ?
עליתי מישראל בשנת 2021 לבריטניה וזו ההחלטה הכי טובה בחיי....השתחררתי מהטילים של המחבלים ומחוסר הביטחון והיציבות במדינה הזו....לא יודע איך שאר הישראלים יכולים להרשות לעצמם להישאר שם.
Terrorist sympathiser..these juhadists dont want peace..they had their opportunity..they had their land yet their real purpose is the total annhiliation of israel
War is awful. Innocent people killed on both sides. Heartbreaking.
Gaza is starting to look like Bakmut
The US needs to learn from China to become a war-free global economy and not waste its financial and human resources in becoming a global arms supplier and warmonger.
Twadi behan no land sale israil snd usa
Free Palestine
"It makes no sense for politicians to say &quot;&quot;we are securing the release of the hostages&quot; while at the same time Israel continues to bomb innocent people inside Gaza, this policy is in coherent."
"Israel is a nation of promise from God to Abraham, because Abraham was a friend to God. When Abraham was well advanced in years (approx. 100 years old) &amp; his Sarah was barren and well past the years of childbearing ( approx. 80 years old). God told Abraham that his wife would be with child &amp; it was so. When Sarah heard the news that she would be with child at her age she laughed then God told Abraham that he would name his son Isaac which means laughter, Isaac begot Jacob, then later God changed Jacob&#39;s name to Israel &amp; Israel had 12 sons who would be the beginning of the nation of Israel. The Nation of Israel are the seed of Abraham. The existence of Israel is a miracle of God, &amp; God promised Abraham that I will bless those that bless you &amp; curse those who curse you. I pray for your peace Israel... Yehoshua is your hope... יֵשׁוּעַ, (Read Genesis chapters 12 through 35 - 1st book of Moses)"
"Oy, vey. Is this another Holocaust, or is this a pogrom? Should we erect a memorial on the National Mall?"
The biden administration are not Americans.....prriod
"Why does the media only focus on Hamas attacks? And not on the genocide that Israel has done to the Palestine people for years. I don’t know who Hamas is, but I know they won a fair election in Gaza and the very next day they attacked Gaza with support of the U.S. after that the U.S. referred to Hamas as terrorist. And how is the U.S. going to tell other nations not to get involved when they were the first ones to get involved."
I hope y’all make it back OK

Thank you for calling them terrorists.

H!tlêr was right about how we treat J*ws
Lies
Israel has all the weapons and high tech military.
Biden loves wars keeps finding wars he is not a leader to  bring  peace but he wants more killing
"Israel has cut off water,food,fuel and electricity all while continuing to bomb 2.3 million civilians , half of which are children under 15 in the name of &quot;hamas&quot;, a pure act of GENOCIDE and ETHNIC CLEANSING and some people are so heartless to say that they stand with Israel? You support all of those deaths ? You dont see ANYTHING wrong whatsoever? &#39;Israel has a tight to defend itself &#39;can and will never justify the bombing of babies! Please get out of mainstream media thats is feeding lies that have being identified and inform yourself with something that is not atrocity propaganda, something that does not go according to &quot;yes but they started it...they did this so its fine if we doing it&quot; ,nothing and let me reiterate nothing should ever make you go &quot;I support this Genocide BECAUSE....&quot; THERE ARE NO HUMANE JUSTIFICATIONS TO GENOCIDE <br>Please open your eyes and hearts <br>I know you would never want your children to be bombed or starved to death so just for once put yourself on the shoes of those innocent civilians who are now losing their parents, their babies ,their wives,their husbands"
"I still remember 9/11 with horror and pain. The taking, torturing, and murder of hostages is an even higher level of depravity. Any moral high ground from being oppressed is lost for anyone participating in that barbarity."
Keep going israel spare no mercy
How much are lies? Keep in mind these new channels
alahu Akbar where&#39;s you&#39;re god now terrorist scums
"Asia analysis:<br><br>1. Ukraine-Russia even in fighting, they choose humanity, now comes to Israel-Hamas turn.<br>2. For sure, Hamas will choose humanity, because he has no other choice.<br>3. Egypt close its border, such as crowdy Gaza, for sure innocent people has no way to escape from war field once Israel troops enter Gaza, massacre is the only thing could happen to Palestine people. <br>4. If Israel choose humanity, they must free all Palestine people from Gaza, as they have no other choice, unless they want to perform Genocide.<br>5. Israel already killed at least 40 foreigners, destroyed united nations University and schools.<br>6. If no news from Gaza, this war will be escalated and burn whole middle east altogether, that would be the worst scenario, as now has no electricity in Gaza.<br>7. Israel-Hamas war will have little impact to world economy, but it has power to shake whole world, it is a reverse compare to ukraine-russia war.<br>8. Israel must take every step carefully, sometimes thing will totally run out of expectation easily.<br><br>Go peace and negotiate, follow UN resolution."
IDF are heroes rescuing hostages as we speak. IDF are HEROES🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱
"Asian, try to balance both side voices, only we could hear both voices:<br><br>Gaza people said they do not support Hamas, but since Israel government is the same as Hamas, and much extreme compare to Hamas, killing babies, women etc, now even no home, no food, no drink for them. Some of them said they have no weapon but they will fight with evil Israel troops with their body, what to be fear? As they have no future for a long time, now they have no family either after air strikes, if Hamas need them, they will join to fight with much evil Israel. Their baby and woman are human, and our baby and woman are nothing, thats the reality. Our family deaths even not a number in media.<br><br>Go peace and negotiate, follow UN resolution."
Why are the most evil so quick to project.
"Oh,NO BIAS THIS TIME?"
All support to Israel from Spain! Be strong!

"Why Christians support Jews? Is that because God of Christians (Jesus son of merry) has been killed by Jews?<br>Look at what Christians believes and after that they support Jews against Muslims who love Jesus Christ, the Messiah, the Messenger of God"
2M Palestinians are hostages for decades.  They deserve to be heard as well.
America should do another Iraq but this time it&#39;s Isreal and Palestine both that should be brought to heel and then we force a new constitution on both of them spend the 6 billion that we send for weapons on rebuilding everything and then deploy robots and drones to police the new country and never leave and no one&#39;s happy but there&#39;s a veiled peace
The goverment of the uk stands with israel the people of the uk stand with palestine
let’s all take a second to thank Slo Biden for letting up on sanctions against Iran and then giving them $6 billion to help them fund the Hamas attacks 💡 …. TRUMP was right  ; yet Again ! 🫶🏼 ..
"This won&#39;t stop the war, the children that have lost their parents, will retaliate and avenge their parents when they have grown up"
We need to end ww3 as quick as possible without millions being killed.
They decapitate babies. The entire world knows. I never knew how horrific they really are.Women feel baby murders the most.I am absolutely shocked.
"Surely the pro-life republitard party will condemn the coward, barbaric murders of innocent lives and many young enfant lives. Oh no that’s true… republitards are full of crap without principles or norms."
Israel has been massacring the Palestinians for decades. Don&#39;t let the media fool you
I thought that God would be the protector of the Jewish people but I guess I’m wrong. It is a very sad situation for both sides. I was gonna say God bless Bezos we know God did and blessed Jewish people this time around or before the holocaust.
"The policy of that right wing of the Jewish people IS  the one that should protect the Jewish people. Jews are good people. Palestine are good people ,prison Netanyahu today for his field policies and leave the United States alone will you"
Free Israël 🇮🇱
We don’t need retaliation we need peace.
"What do you want, more phone calls from the state department?. I&#39;m sorry about you mom and the others,  but your not the focus of what&#39;s happening. Those hostages are dead no matter what."
Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸 🤔🤔🤔👍👍👍👍
"There are no levels of cruelty to which humans will not descend. The Gaza, Israel and Palestine conflict is a classic example of this."
Your news is all lies the news of the West laughing at themselves and poor people believe Israel is terrorism and innocent killers and bombing like rabid dogs on homes and beds
I&#39;m wondering how many Hamas members have come to our Republic over Biden and the Democrats open border policy.
MSM Propoganda machines are on full blast lately
I’m sure it’s hurting channels like NBC and MSNBC to show Israel in a positive light. All libels support Hamas and in their core they know how evil is the group they support.
awesome. don’t negotiate w terrorist . Israel should take back Gaza .
Not terrorists.  Biden is a racist since he was in young age. How and why would i believe both terrorists USA or Israel the steelers of others lands.  Same what the Americans did to natives.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6G6MWe6IQ&amp;t=1m44s"">1:44</a> them he throws his weapon away and acts like an &quot;innocent&quot; civilian again. <br>Truly disgusting"
"NBC should ask is these hostages were living in &quot;settler&quot; town built on Palestinian lands while across the wall Gaza is virtually a prison blockaded bu Israel for decades as they refuse to move toward a 2 nation solution and repatriation of Palestinian lands. This the the root cause of this conflict, and as long as it remains, the conflict will continue. So justice/no peace? Ask that."
"The real terrorist that infuriated the Palestinian people was Israel. If you are aware that there was no such place as Israel, you invaded Palestine and never got enough of it. Moreover, you killed babies and innocents intermittently, tortured them, made fun of them, disrespected even their dead, threw bombs at mosques, hospitals and parks during holidays and locked the Palestinian people in a small place in their own country. The real terrorist is Israel and those who support it"
"Are you aware that Israel, whose citizens are taken hostage, does not care?"
In a few weeks the media will turn its attention to deaths in Gaza and turn world opinion against Israel as always .<br>Hypocrite scum media.<br>תודה רבה שלום
Israel has blocked all roads in or out. How do the women and children leave?
That s  not  America 🇺🇸  problem  we can&#39;t  keep  helping everyone  don&#39;t  you&#39;ll  have  your own  army
Egypt staying neutral. How ironic.
"Biden can not take responsibility for Americans, people cannot blame him. Use him like a target in hamss. This is gods will the book of revelations. Wars and rumors of wars.

And what are Zionist are doing to Palestinians?????
"Biden should do MORE for release of hostages rather than providing arms to Zionists to continue killing of kids, babies, women and men.  Zionist must leave occupied lands."
It is to bad that the Palestinian’s elected Hamas to lead them. Hamas could care less for the Palestinian people.
"Peace for Palestine, end the 75 years of occupation"
"This is terrible but how can we defend the world in Israel, Taiwan, South Korea and Ukraine simultaneously? This is a logistical nightmare"
So because other countries are in a war we have to involve ourselves? I just don’t get it

"Y’all wanted to vote for Biden there ya go bunch of idiots, Donald trump would’ve wiped down hamas"
Why weren’t any reporters in Ukraine doing this same style of reporting…… unless?
"Technically the French tourist donating blood could be ethnically Jewish.  France has the 3rd largest Jewish population after Israel and the U.S.  No judgements, just saying."
"Leave them to it. This is not a matter for the West or Westerners to get involved in- we hold no stake in Israel, the holy land has long been dead Jerusalem exists only in our hearts now. This a matter for desert people, let them fight and die. We should not send any of our young, lower and middle class to die for trust fund holders and wicked politicians- let them go fight and die if it’s so important. No Western loves or resources should go to this conflict we’ve economically ruined ourselves with the inflationary tactics of both our WEF controlled fed. gov’ts (US &amp; CND)"
"Hamas also intensifies running like 🐥, hiding with civilians, 😭 and praying their last hope will save them from the mighty Israel&#39;s vengeance, the UN. Simple yet effective strategy."
😂😂😂😂
wow this propaganda is bs
"ANYONE WHO IS SIDING WITH HAMAS IS SIDING WITH THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS:<br><br>- SHOOTING PARENTS IN FRONT OF THEIR CHILDREN<br>- KIDNAPPING 4-Year-olds <br>- BEHEADING BABIES<br>- BURNING ENTIRE FAMILIES ALIVE <br><br>Please, look deep in your heart and acknowledge the fact that anyone who justifies these actions for any reason whatsoever is a vile twisted human being. There is no context in which these animals slaughtering children can be morally justified."
Oh no we got joe on the problem now it’s just gonna get worse they should give Ukraine another 40 billion dollars it solves everything
Let&#39;&#39;s Not forget when ETHIOPIAN JEWS were trying to return to ISRAEL how they were treated and the DISCRIMINATION and HATRED they faced. Israeli people are NOT INNOCENT.
Say no to war 😢😢😢 my people
This time full bulletin without the name of Ukraine.
Jahanum wasil kre Israel ko . Allah please help to palestine
Yeah Hamas killing civilians is a terrorist act but Israel killing thousands of civilians even children is a retaliation act.<br>Israel = Hamas
USA has its own problem your don&#39;t need to support Israel
What a drag😔
This who their prophet Muhammad was a big time terrorist.
This is HORRIBLE.... BUT WHY?????? Does the United States have to always bail out other Countries? SMH
Not even six thousand people talking about a war on a holy city
Biased reporting!! God bless the People of Palestine. If the Zionist Apartheid thinks they have won by the numbers. More will come this Jewish terrorist will never live in peace!!!! RIP to the Martyrs of Palestine! From your Christian brothers.
This has very many similarities with 1945 Warsaw ghetto uprising!!! It bet you the Israelis will be as ruthless leveling the camp
We need the Trumpster back!
This is insanity.  Modern warfare is just bombing.  Get ready for a drone attack there or anywhere really.
It&#39;s sad because you don&#39;t want this is the reality what we are today is when we&#39;re going to be tomorrow so get used to it because this is what this is showing this is our future now in the internet and technology more wars everywhere people divided and I&#39;ll country also when you have division in people you have conflict
These people have been fighting for almost a thousand years overland that is the same kind of line that I&#39;m on in fact their land is more unstable they could be a horrible earthquakes in those area that will destroy everything one of these days the broad should have children for nothing all for nothing is not about democracy is not about getting along it&#39;s about you don&#39;t believe me I don&#39;t believe you so we got to fight
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6G6MWe6IQ&amp;t=1m02s"">1:02</a>   no  it&#39;s targeting Palestinians women and children!!"

This is so intensly sad. I feel for all the innocent people being killed and their friends and family.
I wish one American politician would have the guts to say NO MORE MONEY for holy wars.
Baby murdering savages. And muslims wonder why people fear and hate them.

"When the dust settles. Russia/CCP China or Putin/Xi three war +1 plan has begun and this is only the beginning of the bloodshed. This is to take on the global power of the United States. <br><br>The first of the 3 war +1 plans by  Putin/Xi is with NATO. Ukraine invasion. BRICS illuminating the U.S. dollar in 3 years plan. <br><br>The second of the 3 war plans +1 by Putin/Xi is with OPEC/Middle East with the attack of Israel with the backing of Syria and Iran. <br><br>The third of the 3 war plans +1 by Putin/Xi is with South Asia/Japan with the island in the South China Sea. <br><br>+1 is the civil war inside the United States focused on greed and racism. Greed allows the billionaire&#39;s think tanks to control our national policy that protects their bottom line instead of the working class poor and racism with the white majority living in fear for their lives forced to focus on their own backyard&#39;s needs. <br><br>That&#39;s the bigger picture. Europe/EU with the exception of England are not our allies. The United States has only 3 friends they can count on, England, Japan, and Israel. That&#39;s the cold light of day reality check. <br><br>Know thy enemy, know thy selves."
It is Israeli terror
HAMAS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF CHILDREN AND INNOCENT PEOPLE.
"for a decade palestinian family has been killed,kidnaped,prisoned...and you kept silent...double standart"
May the Lord protect you all.. oh God  have mercy always to us 🙏🙏
how is it &quot;targeting hamas&quot; when you blow up a whole multistorage building just like that? did it say &quot;hamas headquarter&quot; or something? this is crazy.
Gaza can give up whenever they want and they will live. Israel can&#39;t.
"Stop calling it a terrorist attack. It&#39;s a religious war which makes it more primitive, barbaric and infantile. These civilizations need to grow up and recognize that their holy texts are man made and the secular civilizations cannot evolve nor progress forward because their bronze aged beliefs cause only death, destruction and terror."
&lt;&lt;protect the unborn from the meatgrinder of samsara

"Here&#39;s what I don&#39;t understand, if an enemy kills the innocent, we retaliate and do the same for which we condemned?"
Be prepared to be Martyrs for the sake of the Jews.
"They’re both terrorist states, they both have political arms booming each others children  and citizens. The difference is that one has IS support and media support and the other doesn’t"
"Western media is lying.  Do your cameras see how much Israel bombed  in Gaza?  Israel has killed 1,200 so far, most of them children and women."
"this is not an example of strategic warfare, it&#39;s blatant serial killing behaviour on a sadomasochistic level"
Honest reporting? Funny. The only reason it&#39;s honest reporting is because the polls are running about 90% pro Israel. NBC not in the biz of turning people off
Seems like Israel is the aggressor now leaving the reporting up to the media.  <br>🤨😳🫤
nbc = unbiased
Last I checked Israel was entertaining China and reluctant to supply Ukraine with weapons.I think we should stay out of this and let them work it out themselves.
"The recent events in Israel are a clear indication of the consequences of Western hesitancy. It&#39;s imperative that the U.S. provides substantial support to Ukraine; otherwise, Taiwan might be the next in line."
"Why when things happen by your own choice outside your own country, the demand for the lost has to be responsible from your own country? Don&#39;t we have to be responsible for our own choice??"
Israel also goes too far with the palestian kids too arresting military court
"shouldn&#39;t of moved to a terrorist state.  Treat people like animals and you&#39;re surprised when they fight back? Wow. Wake up. Hamas should stand down and let the Palestinian Military take over, oh, that&#39;s right, they don&#39;t have one. They&#39;re not allowed to have a military and if anyone fights the open air prisoning of their people, they&#39;re labeled a terrorist.  Where was the outrage when the Israeli army marched into Egypt and went from village to village slaughtering all the women and children?"
support israel against hamas. hamas people are terrorists.
no more United Nation in term of WAR?
"Zionist Israel didn&#39;t have any right to protect themselves, they are the root cause of all the problems"
"Well, there you go. If you support terrorist you’ll die as such. These evil actions won’t fix the issues…it just prolonged everyone’s suffering. STOP fighting!"
I highly doubt any Americans are alive

"Every Israeli citizen is military trained, some are retired from the military, some are serving in the military, some are military trained reserve forces, so the question is where are the civilians in Israel??"
Why USA supporting Israel?
Islam is evil
Japan 🇯🇵 stand with Israel 🇮🇱…<br>Our government is disgraceful…<br>G7 chair Japan opts not to sign statement by 5 leaders supporting Israel….
"US already sell israel that is the reason why this happened, they sell the Intelligent exchange money to cover América hole...<br>ask Biden how much he got."
"Iran is behind this. And everyone knows. So, with their only major ally, Russia, being in a major war, this is the perfect time for Israel to Nuke Tehran! What about the people of Iran? The same goes for them as the people of Germany during WW2. They allow the minority terrorists to stay in control, so they go with them."
"What do you expect when you take the country of Palestine by force and send its entire population to a cage called Gaza, the people there will not take revenge on you, you are now living in their houses and beating them"
Has the USA lost its soul and it’s MIND? How can the USA in good consciousnesses support the Israeli Apartheid State? NBC is Censored from reporting the TRUTH. There’s No mention of how Israels killings unarmed men women and children
"Conflicts in Sudan, Ukraine,Haiti,Armenia,Ethiopia,Syria,Myanmar,Yemen, now Israel. Earth quakes ,floods,Hurricanes,volcanic eruptions,wild fires, record breaking heat everywhere,  mass migration of people , disease pandemics ,cost of living surpassing peoples wages , strikes , ethnic and cultural conflicts all over the place what’s going on?"
"Must saves/keeps hostages and prisoners both isreals and Palestinians there peace,health,guards, etc,important to save hands up to solves the affairs because off civilians...its concerning religions and international agreements..."
Islamic world vs israel<br>Goliath vs david
I&#39;m not saying we&#39;re wrong here. I&#39;m just questioning why we have a completely different policy on Ukraine?<br>Shouldn&#39;t we be supporting Russia? I don&#39;t understand this weird double standard.
Hamas is a plague of modern civilization.
"Another pre planned drama by Israel to capture more land for free.😅<br><br><a href=""https://youtu.be/P0V00kadOQE?si=anpFB1cjhm25Qd4s"">https://youtu.be/P0V00kadOQE?si=anpFB1cjhm25Qd4s</a>"
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
"Animals have the right to live, but don’t the Palestinian people have the right to live? Palestine is the oppressed and weak party.  It is fair to condemn both sides for killing civilians, why not condemn Israel? This is unfair. I remember that in the past border conflict between China and India, Israel sold weapons to India to support it. In this conflict between Israel and Palestine, China did not provide weapons to support Palestine. This is  It is unfair and does not respect the principle of equality. China should use actions to support Palestine."
America is the main agent in the world in influencing wars    .....😢😢😢😢
"there is zero coverage of israeli settlers terrorizing palestinians before this, stealing land and homes. this is not unprovoked."
All this by religion differences 😔 this is god work ? Really killing innocent people barely living just because 😔
What about America? We are at war
"I have more respect for Russia more then Palestine,<br>Russia only targeting ukrainian Soldiers,,,Respect<br>Palestine targeting women and children,,,cowards<br>That&#39;s the difference between<br>Men 👉 🇷🇺 <br>And Animals 👉 🇵🇸"
We are at war
What a racist news media
"I&#39;m fed up with religious fanatics...in Gaza/Israel  or storming the Capitol  with an &#39;invisible&#39; God on their side , of course.  God is great eh? God is always right eh? On both sides of a conflict.  Ukraine has been  forgotten by MSM   Ukraine  my friend the &#39;journalist&#39;, is &#39;at war&#39;  too."
"&quot;So you take some hope in that?&quot; Lester, I thought you had more brains than that!"
take  responsibility?
Please make sure the whole world knows about the atrocities
"This is not America&#39;s fight, we need to stay out of this"
This is madness. Human beings doing this to helpless people?
Thanks Joe and Obama with help of Fake News nobody is safe anywhere  !
Israel has the right to defend itself 🇮🇱 and they will try their best to not hurt Palestinian civilians like they always do.
"If the Israeli government plays eye for an eye with a terrorist group, which one is better?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6G6MWe6IQ&amp;t=6m39s"">6:39</a> they stole land and now crying like a baby when Palestine are trying to defend itself and take their land back.<br><br>How would u feel, if someone comes in your house and says its mine and you get out. The reality of who truly is innocent can be seen on those images compare Palestine to Isreal? <br><br>Which one is more built? Which receive billions in aids? Truly, its disgusting that all these media reports are one sided trying to show the killer as innocent, the theif as innocent. Who gave them the right to their own land, its like a french person coming to<br>England and saying wipe out the map keep the people in prison (an open air prison) shut off the supplies and change the name.<br><br>Does it even make sense? Just disgusting.<br><br>Who is the real Terrorist? A group of people taking land, having billions of aid, even declaring genocide? How can anyone support Isreal?"
Respect for Biden 🙏💪❤️🇮🇱
Americans need to stay in America. I do not support Israel bombing innocent people.
Why weren’t citizens armed?….what are the gun laws in Israel?
The United States should not be part of any effort by Israel to cut off water and power to civilians in Gaza.
And this is how the 200 million strong army will cross the Haiti&#39;s river and destroy the West give it less than a year
Keep prepping folks . It’ll be here sooner than later . Our borders are still open even after the millions of invaders have come here.
still fighting over religion after thousands of years.
NOT a retaliation! it&#39;s punishing evil!
War crimes by Israel in the making
So the most secure nation in the world completely dropped the ball on all fronts concering an invasion?<br><br>Israels leadership allowed this attack to happen.
men dying over religion...when will we ever learn.  U.S. does not need to be involved in this stupidity
Make sure that the Soldiers see the footage before they go in to Gaza.
"No fan of JB, but it&#39;s not really his fault that there are Americans there."
"The hypocrisy of the world nowadays is through the roof. When it&#39;s Hamas killing innocent people we call it terrorisms. However, when it&#39;s Israelis killing Innocent people ( That&#39;s right! Palestinians are people too ) we say it&#39;s retaliation or we call them collateral damage. The hard truth is FEW PEOPLE ACTUALLY SYMPATHISE WITH PALESTINIANS! <br>I still remember the video of that helpless father and his 12-year old son, cowering in terror before he got killed. I was a little kid and it scarred me for life. <br>Killing innocents is not okay regardless of which side of the fence they are."
"Israel is wicked,they killed our Lord and still looking forward to the Messiah, they killed all God&#39;s prophet and deciple,they are not the real Jews, the real Jews are black"
The IDF has fallen so far.
"Biden caused this attack! Y’all , Biden is behind all of this !"
"I  am going to make Jerusalem a cup that sends all the surrounding peoples reeling. Judah will be besieged as well as Jerusalem.  On that day, when all the nations of the earth are gathered against her, I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock for all the nations. All who try to move it will injure themselves.  On that day I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness,” declares the Lord. “I will keep a watchful eye over Judah, but I will blind all the horses of the nations. Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, ‘The people of Jerusalem are strong, because the Lord Almighty is their God.’"

Sad innocent people died rip
Freedom freedom freedom freedom freedom freedom freedom freedom freedom freedom freedom freedom <br>Freedom freedom freedom <br>For Palestine
Ukraine sure got tossed like a hot rock. Poor lil comedy lost all of his news coverage
I hate that Hamas evil minds
"Why don&#39;t you report how Israel is bombing and attacking 4 different countries at the same time in the last 48 hours but they still play the victim. (Palestin, Lebanon, Egypt and Syria). The Germans were very smart back in the day"
Shame on you so called civilized west and zionist media
They to unite to fight  the enemy  freedom for palistine people
"Israel is also a terrorist organization, so let&#39;s not get carried away here."
Palistine  need help from there contry mam
"Unfortunately the cycle of violence will just continue. Both sides should seek peace, not all this violence. Every missile used by the IDF of course means more profits for the US Military industry. And how does Biden complain about Violence by Hamas and not say anything about the carpet bombing of Palestinian children and women? All are human beings, and war crimes are war crimes. Seek Peace, real peace."
B careful in America. Evil tyrant Adolf biden will drop a bomb on America in a heartbeat and blame another country and have their media puppets push that story.  Trust me he and his colleagues r that evil
Theyget what theydeseve along time they are killing  palistine peoplethem
Do not trust that elite puppet Biden at all
What the msm will not admit is this is biblical and Jesus Christ is coming 🙏

There&#39;s no reason to do what they did hunting people down there is diplomacy resources that must be put to work now
Treat people like animals and they&#39;ll bite back Palestinians treated like dirt for yrs no fox news bbc news cbs news Israel has been killing men women and children for decades any people would fight back Israel an its allies are responsible for the deaths of Israelis look at what the settlers do on a daily basis
"hey dude, dont wait for your mom, go join the offensive and save her."
Animals
"No tears for the 243,000 killed in Afghanistan<br><br>‏🛑No tears for the 1 million and 120 thousand killed in Iraq<br><br>🛑 No tears on 613407 killed in Syria<br><br>‏🛑 Tears only on Israel"
"Everything has been clear with Israel for 50 years: <br>UN General Assembly Resolution 3379 &quot;Elimination of all forms of racial discrimination&quot; was adopted on November 10, 1975 at the XXX session of the UN General Assembly. It ranked Israel alongside apartheid States such as South Africa and Rhodesia, and ruled that Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination!"
Oh nobody is doing enough for your mom??? Are you serious grow up bro ppl dead everywhere
"What Should Israel Do Next in Light of Their Declaration of War?<br><br>First, we should reflect deeply upon the painful divide that has festered among us, causing the devastating toll of hundreds of lives lost and thousands wounded. We need to yearn for a major change and wholeheartedly unite as one. Only the bonds of unity can shield us from future tragedy and elevate our nation from the abyss of despair.<br><br>We cannot afford to nurse bitterness or delay action, waiting for the war&#39;s end to ponder our fractured state. Now is the time for introspection. We need to pinpoint the reasons behind our present circumstances and act accordingly.<br><br>Our quest for understanding needs to extend to our lives’ very source: the upper force of love, bestowal and connection that acts on us beyond our current level of awareness, which perceives through an egoistic and divisive lens. It is no matter of religion, but a realization that reality’s governing force is singular, and we accordingly need to stand united before it as one.<br><br>Precisely in our trying times, we are in need for an expansion of consciousness to let the upper force of love and bestowal into our lives. We need to raise the pain and anguish that erupts in so many people in such times to the upper force, and wish for it to mend our torn relations, and draw us closer together. We must seek to hold each other close to our hearts, not solely in times of war, but as an enduring duty.<br><br>We are a nation established not on a biological foundation, but on a spiritual-ideological one: &quot;Love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; That is, we were people from all around ancient Babylon who felt a problem with living our lives solely according to competitive-materialistic ideals and sought for a higher truth to our existence, which we revealed as a higher force of love, bestowal and connection that united us above our divisive drives. That is why we cannot remain divided without suffering from our separation.<br><br>Our mission to unite above our divisions is constant, because divisive egoistic desires constantly surface within us, driving us apart. Therefore, much like a diligent student who finds new homework awaiting them each day, we should not accumulate any more overdue assignments that end up exploding in our faces, pressuring us into critical situations such as the one we now find before us. Instead, we should hurry up and correct our hearts to favor unity “as one man with one heart” above our divisions."
Wow did they admit they were retaliating before the terror attack?
"Why when ukraine is attacked my russia everyone stand with ukraine , but israel been attacking palestine and taking their land for years but beacsue their middle eastern and muslim no body cares about palestine, what a joke and this is coming from an irish christianm"
"Israel have been launching &#39;terror attacks&#39; on palestine for years and the west have nothing at all to say then, completely favour israel, my thoughts are with the people of palestine."
Welcome to the boom boom room….
Notice when Joey points to his nose like Pinocchio .......
Killing captives ain&#39;t going to change anything at this point.
"you reporters ask stupid, obvious questions there is no hope during a war!!"
Your president is a murderer and will answer for it!
War equals profit. Its just a business.
I wish both sides had the courage to de-escalate. What Hamas did was horrific. But there are millions of innocent Palestinians. This is going to get extremely bloody.
Western media is hypocrite
Biden not winning the next election
Hamas attack “terror” … Israel attack “defense”<br>When you treat people less than animals and take away their home and liberty you produce extremist! Israel is just as guilty as Hamas on this conflict
We are  still waiting for Israel&#39;s retaliation to Germany for the last 70 years.
Inside job. There is no way the Israeli secret services did not know about this plan.
Calling Hamas a terrorist?<br><br>I will ask you a simple question who let this happened on 1942? Is it palestine is it Hamas? No . Its the french government and Europe pouring 300k jews into palestine and occupied their land aftet the Ottomans colapsed.<br><br>Remember 80 years of oppression bombing gaza buildings etc. none of that reported and when realization and retaliation comes for 80 years of silence calling hamas the Bad guys? <br><br>Better check your facts bias medias
You are terrors
Isreal have been killing and persecuting Palestinians men woman and children 70something years
Another flood is coming. Water and fire to cleanse the planet .<br>Earthquakes and tornadoes shall increase in intensity. People will disappear before that Great Day of Judgment.
biden is useless.
Palestinian  deserve statehood
How can a country rescue hostages bombing the place they&#39;re being captive?
I don’t know are they really targeting Hamas or the citizens? I don’t believe the real headquarters of Hamas is in Palestine or Gaza?
"So many Palestinians have been attacked in the past 75 years and they were invaded in World War 2 after losing the war then as soon as we counter these attacks and fight back it is us that are the terrorists it&#39;s us that are evil. The media have no idea how much we have suffered in the past and currently, but as soon as we defend and attempt to take back what&#39;s rightfully ours we are portrayed as terrorists. From 2008 till September 2023, 6,407 Palestinians have been killed every year when we celebrate a Muslim tradition Eid we are boombed and attacked, the Palestinians had to celebrate the day of celebrations two days after as they had to plan funerals after the killings of Jews and Isralians."

"USA is in collapse and huge dept and now Israel and Ukraine wars will fully end the American world order, obviously USA is now the worlds biggest problem but thankfully the China alliance will rule over America and make the world much less violent and more prosperous"
"Idk where this news channels is when Palestine&#39;s people being harass and young Palestine&#39;s people where kidnapped and torchured &amp; killed, that time no one sees this bulshit by bulshit county, now when this same thing being happened there, everybody showing empathy,, btw i didn&#39;t support hama&#39;s action&#39;s but when you shake so much pepsi bottle it&#39;s come throw with very much pressure, that&#39;s what happening, sorry for English."
Israel killed many Palestine

"What can America do in Israel other than offer whatever support the Israelis might request? This is Israel&#39;s fight, not ours. Americans and other foreign nationals in Israel are there at their own risk. Hopefully the Israeli government and the IDF can  either negotiate for the release, or rescue of the hostages."
You’ve just killed your mom by calling them animal on the national TV😂
Trust me they not killing for no reason . There’s 3 sides to a story . I heard side from the other side saying they was abuse and wasn’t free in Gaza . It simple you don’t want war no more . Free Gaza from your slavery laws . Or keep living in fear without Jesus Christ
"Both sides loose,,, they have lost since the beginning of this war that has transcended generations, steeped in religion and tradition. This will only be resolved by leaders of Countries within that region. America and other Western countries support and influence spur more conflict and intensify the flight."
Sooo yall not gonna talk about the apartheid conditions and terrorism Isreal has been performing against palestine for decades...they&#39;ve been cutting palestine off from supplies in an open air prison for literal decades..bottom line america don&#39;t need to be helping Isreal cuz its ain&#39;t our business...meanwhile yall won&#39;t help Maui..😒👎
Philippines 🇵🇭 Stands with ISRAEL 🇮🇱... praying for ISRAEL 🇮🇱
Do the numbers of dead count palestinians or are they still considered sub-human?
Bila perlu ratakan kembali menjadi komunitas gang motor aja 😊
WHAT ABOUT THE INOCENT PPL ISRAELI&#39;S ARE KILLING FROM YEARS AND YEARS. <br>WILL ANYBODY ANSWERE ON THIS ?
"As most wars are nowadays the blood is on the hands of the west. Israel has violated international law for decades with no repercussions , maybe if us would stop finding terrorists then maybe these things wouldn’t happen. Constantly costing the taxpayers"
"Israel has Apache gunships, drones, fighter jets. Why did it take five hours for Hamas to be engaged? Israel is tiny. A gunship could reach these settlements in minutes to give suppressive fire on the terrorists and have them scramble for cover. Why were they left to rampage for hours?"
Were you devastated!?
Since when did American Administrations care about American civilians?
israel soldiers &amp; non-soldiers have been torturing &amp; killing Palstinians for almost a decade.<br>Why stupid peoples who support satanisrael expect Palestine to not do anything???
If Ukraine is defending its land what Palestinians are doing .
INDIA WITH ISRAEL
Iraelis who cares. Americans poor babies
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Mr Pres Biden your excellency, huhuhu dont make any damaging moved , Americans are great, and limitless you can destroy everything, and stop everything but please dont do it in a painful way .huhuhu . please do it best way to saves lives . thanks you"
Title should be &quot;Israel intensifies oppression after retaliation from the oppressed&quot;
Let’s be clear this is Bye dims fault. He gave Iran the $6B enabling them to fund Hamas. Bye dim is absolutely useless.
Hamas r satanic dawgs
When Biden is going send troops to our borders ?
My heart goes out to my beloved Israeli people.
"Hamas positions... you&#39;re so full of it. They&#39;re bombing civilians... again! Also cutting off power, water and fuel is a war crime."
Realistically what can anyone do to release the hostages? Only talking will do that. The man complaining that the embassy had only rung him once is being unrealistic. Does he think the staff are sitting round drinking coffee? He is one of hundreds.
This was real news not BS propaganda as 😊from some other sources.
"Why ? Its these the answer ha ha .to all leaders. Let give peace a chance..stopppp it now .have a peace talk .we know all the leaders are great and intelligent but please stooppp , love love love and not war . please have a loving heart and saves lives please we are begging to all leaders.lets advice them to stopped."
Pray for victims.god bless israel
"It&#39;s time for Israeli authorities, to wake up. In the last 73 years, they killed millions of Phillistinians. Now they taste the bitter truth and feel what it feels like. Keep it up the brother and sister of Philistine, very soon you will have your freedom."
I guess this is the end of Palestine as the world new it
"While FOX news whines about how all this is the Dems fault, MSNBC have the balls to be reporting from Israel. Bravo NBC"
Which one is terrorist attack ? Palestinian protest or Zionist massacres? What the jewish doing on Palestinian land? Just go to USA and the Middle East would be peaceful.  Europe will not allow the jewish though.😊
"Palestinians have been watching and experiencing same situation in the last 70 years by the illegal Israeli terrorists. Innocent Palestinians have been killed,  evicted, and jailed by the Israeli terrorists decades after decades... but the hypocrite Western world ignored those always."
Hamas is the group retaliating. Retaliating after 75 years of genocide. Good Jews remember what genocide looks like.
Israelis are real terrorists they killed thousands of innocents from years<br>Shame on you.
"What were Americans doing in an occupied apartheid terror-state? That’s not a safe place to be. Violence should be anticipated. If Hamas is a terror group (it is), so is the IDF."
"Now you guyz start to count about innocent!  We also not support about it, but the questions comes to here what about Palestinians innocents? Those they(Israel) killed from many years? Did you put comments same in that times? Thats y its called double standard!!#"
The hostages are dead and hamas will be wiped out!!! They will never risk this happening again to the people of Israel..
Biden gave 6m dollars to iran and iran funded these terrorists
Palestine  loves  war and Islam because their messiah appears  when there is  great  chaos.
Destroy Hamaz
The entire middle east should become a parking lot. No nation or culture there is worth its weight in camel dung.
level gaza.
I have seen worse videos of Israeli soldiers and settlers doing to Palestinians . But you think that Israeli blood is more precious<br>Biden is reading a script LOL
"All the honest reporting comments: Oh, please. Their reporting is honest, because the polls overwhelming show American citizens as pro-Israel at the moment. Even the bartender congressperson tried to straddle the fence. So-called palestinians have no justification for this whatsoever."
Why religion is bad.
An honest headline would be: “Israel intensifies retaliation after Hamas retaliates in response to decades of abuse at the hands of the Jews.”
Palestinians all cheers one day and getting steamrolled the next and crying they are victims.
"Все удары Хамас по мирному населению Израиля, сделаны на деньги Байдена, он руководит Хамас. Байден хочет ядерную войну между Россией и США, он ее начал. Байден готовился к ядерной войне 30 лет, он продал всю индустрию Америки в Китай, Корею, Индию для того, чтобы жить там. Байден построил себе бункер, куда залезет во время ядерных взрывов. Байден хочет уничтожить население России, Европы, США, потому что нас слишком много для Байдена, он голодает😊"
They were coming out of the prison called Gaza it’s Israel who grew those monsters and turned them into animals
Biden better put boots on the ground to fight HAMAS - please support Israel &amp; Chillingbourne. 💙💙
Could the scripture be tru.... is this the final fight....be4 the rapture.
deadly attack by israel on palestine are not shown on the the news WHY? it is a sad moment for everyone who died but tell the truth at least.
"Biden better be strong. Do something! He has been weak on Ukraine, if he watches Americans die this way I will turn my back on him forever."
Wow now the us is going to get involved what’s that gonna solve
Religion at its best on each side.
This man thinks the US can get hostages out during a war in record time.
Biden i&#39;s a evil.
Freedom to Palestine ! Stop Israel aggression ! Ashkenazi Jews go where you came from !
"Hamas knew this was going to happen,but hamas doesn&#39;t represent the palestinians they represent iran and iran didn&#39;t want Israel to sign a peace deal with the saudis so they orchestrated this attack and now it&#39;s the people of gaza that are going to pay for it.I used to have some sympathy for the people of gaza but no more they have hidden and aided hamas which is no better than ISIS and there can be no quarter or mercy given to terrorists.Canada and I stand with Israel.🇨🇦🤝🇮🇱"
Anyone think this is only the beginning ? Like the begging or the end times?
Israel has been killing hundreds of Palestinians / Muslims every day for the past decades. No one cared. Now the Palestinians retaliate... Then the whole world cries for Israel....  😢 Everyone knows very little that the Palestinians were the natives of these lands... Most of the Jewish population came from Europe after WW2. And stole homes from the Palestinians.. I&#39;m a Christian and I pray for the Palestinian people.
Filistinde 70 yıl süren işgal ve ablukada kaç çocuk ve kadın öldü. Biliyormusunuz.Resmi rakamlara bakın. Bakmadınız çünki sizin için değersiz bir rakam. Şunu anlayın Filistinde bir çocuk nezaman güven  içinde uyur. İsrailde bir çocuk huzur içinde uyur.  Aksi taktirde karşı tarafı öldürmeniz sizi güvende kılmaz. Kılmadıda.
Prayer for the innocent civilians who knew nothing . :( In war indeed nobody wins both side loses someone and something. Shame for those who started this war and now is probably sitting comfortably and safe while others suffers and die.

FREE PALESTINE🇮🇪🇵🇸
Rigged election have consequences you lefties
some days ago jews spit on the face Christian but still Christians support arrogant Jewish
the fight is between Israel and Hamas I suggest the USA keeps is nose out
"09.38 Spain. When Hamas releases all kidnapped victims and gives a body count of all men, women and children killed then Israel can stop bombing Gaza. Until then its WAR!"
🙏🙏🙏
Trusted news CNN and NBC
Hamas beheaded at least 40 babies
"The Gazan woman was saying “If they stay in the house, we die, if we stay in the streets, we die”. Should have thought about that before you guys crossed the border and brazenly massacred civilians. I have no sympathy for those terrorist enablers after celebrating in the streets 4 days ago parading their hostages. Now you weep and are scared"
Infelizmente a situação de Israel parece ser verdadeira o ramas é um grupo radical religioso é preciso buscar a paz mais hoje o objetivo de Israel é acabar com o ramas mais é preciso falar que é que o que acontece hoje com Israel é a resposta do ramas aos crimes do governo de Israel contra o estado da Palestina espera se que o governo de Israel busque o diálogo com a palestina sem isso a paz nunca fará parte da vida de Israel
N other countries don&#39;t think they need guns or protection?!?

The world needs a change .... Biden should go .....WE NEED PEACE
"A convenient narrative &quot; hamas terror attack, Israel is terrified and had to retaliate &quot;"

Why does the news anchor have a smile on his face like he is enjoying giving this news?
"Just for reference, it&#39;s not a &quot;terror attack&quot; when you declare war. Just like Russia saying special military operation. War. There is no terror attacks, it&#39;s war."
"it&#39;s actually Iranians,,"
Apartheid regime of Israhell intensifies its terror attacks on Palestinian territory killing innocent civilians as it has been doing for the past 75 years and all of a sudden hamas becomes the bad guy. Wow to the western hypocrisy.
"Oh no <a href=""https://youtu.be/tyE6Q_xqIig?si=Lp_vq6SRFxlVgArK"">https://youtu.be/tyE6Q_xqIig?si=Lp_vq6SRFxlVgArK</a>"
That leap of faith is going to end up at the bottom of a ravine. Watch your step.
Terrorists have no place to live. The world must stand against them. They are animals not human beings
I fully expect Joe to do (or not do) whatever is the worst course of action to take. That has been Joe&#39;s direction since he entered office as President.
Palestinians aren&#39;t white enough to resist occupation as Ukrainians
Everyone forgets that it’s the western countries that have caused all this read your history and you won’t have to comment. RIP to all that have died in these attacks.
Seld defense is terrorism now!!!<br>Great journalism for a sick agenda that a very few are educated about how the refugees from Ww2 ended up in Palestine in the first place!!!
Im sure Israel feels real confident witn Bidensxweak words. Hes a clown and thecworld is taking advantage of Americas weaknesses. <br>   Way to go weak Americans who voted for the destruction of our democracy 👏. This ia all on you and your blind loyalty to the democrats.
"God is great, death to America, death to Israel, curse on the Jews, victory for Islam"
"All I see is civilians attacks. Shops, markets, houses destroyed. Not a single hamas fighter"
Collective punishment is a war crime.
You think Hamas is capable of negotiating? Best think of the hostages as dead already and just pound Gaza into nothing.
Pressure burst pipes
Why don’t you show us what Israel has done? Why don’t you show us how many people have killed the Jewish? 🤔 uhhhh Free Palestine 🇵🇸
They are freedom fighters!! <br>The real terrorists are zionists that created illegal state of Israel. <br><br>Go back to Europe how you came 70 years ago as guests!! <br>Go back! <br><br>Palestine will never ever be forgotten by Muslims. <br><br>It will be free of Zionist pigs 🐷.
"Palestine has no voice, What do you expect? Theyve been throwing ROCKS for 50 years, trying to be heard."
"Leave it to the US to capitalize on this tragic conflict, i love my country but having this guy walk through and interview civilians actually going through this real time without any actual consequences to himself. You should be ashamed nbc"
Ghaza attac shows that war not end till 3rd war start why not leave plastine captured areas so world safe.
Stop killing civilians in both sides! We are all humans!
"Israel are attacking civillians, the media isnt showing the other side"
Biden is USELESS 😡
The worst part is that the majority of people (especially in the US) are just now really getting a grasp on this whole situation and how long it’s been going on. Especially people under 30 - ME INCLUDED!
"This is why people need to be armed, those Israeli people should of been legally armed to at least have a fair fighting chance. You Government or police cannot save  you in such an attack, It will always be to late."
.......Israel is not a country ... Israeli is a terrorist   ..............  Free Palestine
Why do we keep the enemies to our allies in our lands and house them together? I find it very disrespectful when they start protests and celebrate this right in the faces or across the streets from those who just lost loved ones and had their babies heads decapitated etc... Screaming and shouting what they will do to them at all cost and we all know what they mean by at all cost. This is public threats and I cannot believe that people still support people that would do things like this and not even show any respect.
And just like that Hawaii gets swept under the rug smh
I pray for all people involved. I am sure many innocent will die on both sides.  Christ is my savior. Through him is the only way to God. I pray for all involved to have open hearts and seek the truth of Jesus Christ.
Remember Armenians
Horrible horrible scenes for the innocent trapped on both sides.
They say that in developed countries there is still colonialism and murder of innocent people?
"It seems like Israel has been attacking Palestine for years. Pushing people out of their home and silent missals, and not many news was out. But this time the Palestine’s secret invasion to Israel causing a declaration of war; so many news come out on how bad Palestine attacks are. Not to mention the number of civilians deaths so far on Palestine is still very much higher than Israel."
All the money spent on rockets by Hamas could have been used to make the life better for the people of Gaza
🇺🇸🇵🇸 How many Palestinian Americans have been killed by Israel within Gaza ?
merge the countries. Allow power sharing. Live happy. And dismantle nuclear wepons. Then you guys can live in peace.
He shot that person on the ground like a dog. That ideology is gross.
🇺🇸🇵🇸 If these Americans are Dual Citizens of the United States &amp; Israel then let Israel be responsible. Their loyalty is to Israel.
Israel could flatten and eliminate all  AND ISRAEL WILL STILL HAVE NO REST OR PEACE! The brothers and sisters in neighboring countries and abroad will carry on the fight! The only way out is for the Israelis to give back the occupied lands and the Palestinians establishing and independent State of their own!
"You had Gaza under siege for 15+ years, what did you expect?"
karma will definitely happen no matter where we are. don&#39;t hurt others if you don&#39;t want to be hurt.
"🇺🇸🇵🇸 Israel killing, and targeting nothing but Civilians not military targets."
Let the feast begin.
"They celebrated the attack. They punched and slapped innocent people captured in the back of their trucks while driving through crowds of Palestinians. Now they are crying for because Isreal responed. They have shown their true colours now. But lets not forget, since Biden the US has given Palestine nearly 1 billion dollars, where do you think that money went? Now you know where it went"
"You have seen 70 years of oppression and occupation of the lands of the oppressed and poor people of Palestine, but I did nothing. The oppressor cries out for help, but no one helps. The Jewish and Zionist capitalists, with the help of strong colonialists, displaced and killed the poor and vulnerable people and destroyed their houses, but you only watched and wrote in the books.  Human rights and thatIn 70 years ago, these barbarians easily killed women, children and Palestinians without fear and destroyed their houses to create fear and terror."
only terrorist are zionists and every israeli who thinks he has a right to live in palestine..
Clinton Obama rockets all over Gaza
"May G-d Rest the Souls of the victims at Peace for Eternity and May the victims Rest In Peace Forever Knowing That They Were Loved Forever, That They Are Loved Forever and That They Will Be Loved Forever, Rest In Peace and Amen To Them All, Forever ❤️🙏🕊️🇮🇱🇮🇱<br><br>May G-d Bless Israel and May He Protect the Israeli People and May He Bring About A Swift and Peaceful End To This Horrific War, Amen. 🙏🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱❤️"
"Where were your eyes when THE OPPRESSOR Israel was massacring Palestinians for decades? Then, when the Palestinians wanted to maintain the sovereignty of their country, they were instead blamed. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23freepalestine"">#FREEPALESTINE</a>"
israel is paying for its terrible crimes
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23standwithisrael"">#StandWithIsrael</a>"
I’m impressed NBC is calling them the terrorists they are.
We (the U.S.) need to stay out of this war. That&#39;s why alot of countries dislike us. One side got their land stolen from them. The other side is illegally occupying it.
"There is no both sides if one side infiltrates an unprotected village and massacres 100 people including beheading children.<br><br>The people of Gaza celebrate that, and celebrated the kidnapped civilians paraded on the streets, that&#39;s why they record it."
😅
ユダヤ系アメリカ人でしょう⁉️
"its hipocracy, what paelstenians are doing is terror and what israelis are doing is retaliation"
There is no place for Hamas in this world
Sick and tired from these wars. Grow up men! Enough is enough. Go to western style...go face to face and pull the gun if you want peace for your country..but no innocent should ever ever die no matter what. Politics religion divide us too much already.
Simple. Stop supporting Hamas and your places won&#39;t get flattened.<br>Palestinians need to ban Hamas and chase them out.
"We did our time in the Middle East. We have problems at home, we gave them a nation, they can defend it on their own."
"After 70 years of occupation, apartheid and the expansion of unlawful settlements it’s no wonder that violence ensued. There should have been a two state solution decades ago."
"Israel should have America&#39;s full support. America should have been supporting Israel all along but it was a political game. Now, see the horrors."
"Netanyahu and the criminal incompetence of the Israeli intelligence services are responsible. They failed. If they knew what was planned and what was about to occur then this tragedy could have been prevented. It was the job, the role, the mandate of the intelligences services to monitor threats to Israel. Netanyahu was warned by a senior Egyptian official 3 days before this occurred but he decided to focus on seizing power from the courts and issues in the West Bank. He was criminally negligent!<br>Now with efforts to Blane Iran of some other entity we see false efforts to misdirect and misinform in order avoid responsibility and perhaps to start another forever war. The blood of the thousands of dead Palestinians and Israelis is on the hands of Netanyahu and his extremist cabinet together with the directors of the various Israel intelligence agencies. <br>The extremist polices of Netanyahu, Galland and the other right wing extremist have not worked, the apartheid system has not worked, the practice of imprisonment of 2.1 million people in Gaza has not worked. And as result over 1,000 Israeli and perhaps twice or three times that number of Palestinian families now mourn."
"Who is the real terrorist here? Israel or Hamas? Who completely besieged the Gaza strip by land, sea and air, kept bombing residential buildings and fishermen boats in the false pretense of killing Hamas? You takk about Human dignity and morality, but Israel people become Animals a while ago for opressing Palastinians."
This is what happens when they celebrate evil acts mourning after that!
Don’t forget that Biden negotiated with terrorists and single handedly funded the this slaughter. This is pure EVIL.
Tell ‘em I said chill out caaaaz
"The God of Abraham, Issac and Jacob bless 🇮🇱, whoever touches Israel touches the apple of His eyes."
Whats really going on dont let the media be your only source of information the western media brain washes
Hamaz are gays they are hiding behind hostages.
God bless Palestine
They both terrorist
Just to state a fact Israel been killing children and woman for decades even bombing mosques during prayers so yeah not saying what the rest is doing is good but i think Israel has done and is doing more damage

Islam is the only religion which encourages terrorism
War is ugly.  Hamas started this war.  It&#39;s time Palestinians make their terrorists answer them.
"Shame on you for this biased reporting,<br>hamas act is terrorizing while Israel’s acts are justified since decades.."
idc! Palestines land
This story is biased. Why reporters didn’t go to Gaza hospital as well. When reporting side had a hidden agenda it is not true journalism.
I thought all Israeli citizens were suppose to be armed at all times
Why are you using word terrorist only for hammas and not for israel is this your humanity?
The problem is the idiotic criminal  RESTRAINT  by the stoopid Israeli morons  that are allowing the continuous  terrorist actions.
Why does this guy talk about all this death like we&#39;re dumb.
Allah is with Israel. The Palestinians are desecrating his name.
"Same thing 3 months ago, 1 year ago, 10 years ago, it&#39;s never stopped, never will. They thrive on death and destruction, they love war."
Terrorist trying to play victim cards
"Most peaceful religion at work again <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>"
"Dear 4chan members, it’s time."
They both are crazy.
ALL IN GAZA IS A TERRORIST INCLUDED CIVILIANS IN GAZA...<br><br>WHY THEY DID NOT FIGHT HAMAS OUT FROM GAZA SO THEY SUPPORT HAMAS...
"This is such a nightmare. What exactly is the point of Israel cutting off the water and food supply of ordinary people in Gaza? Why are they reigning terror on normal people rather then actually going after the terrorists? It&#39;s like everything that could go wrong, is going wrong"
NBC supports Hamas.
They are both terrorists to each other. They hate each other.<br>Oh well.
R.I.P.⚰️Gaza

The people of Palestine have probably made the worse decision for their future when they voted Hamas into power.
"Before you comment anything, please study their history as of since 1948..."
Pallets of fungible cash sent to Iran by Obama and Biden.  Hope both like what they bought
When will the Gazans get rid of Hamas which did this knowing full well that there would be repercussions of monumental proportions
You noticed that&#39;s all these are hateful racist USA  the race. card <br>the truth is the SOLDIERS in the BLACK AFRICAN SUPREMIST NETWORK ARMY ARE THE MOST HATEFUL RACIST DISCRIMINTIRY TERRORIST THERE ARE.<br>CHICAGO ILLINOIS AND ITS SUBURBS IN THE USA<br> IS THE CAPITAL OF AFRICAN SUPREMIST MUSLIM NETWORK ARMY  SOLDIERS.<br>BASM NETWORK SOLDIERS  COMMIT MASSIVE FRAUD AND THEFT AND HATEFUL RACIST DISCRIMINATION AGAINST INNOCENT  WHITE NON MUSLIM AND PEOPLE WHO ARE BIRACIDL AND MULITAICAL THAT THE BASM NETWORK SOLDIERS THOUGHT WERE WHITE NON MUSLIM BUT THEY WERE NOT.
Hamas are Islams. It really shows that the’ve started the war and why they are not forgiving?
Hamas soldiers are terrorists but israeli soldiers are know as israeli defence forces.....the irony!!!
Israel been kicking black Jews out the country so Ime sopposed to care about fake Jews and the U S is to blame for a lot of this !!!!!!!     I support the Palastine People
it was devastating that the Jewish community were slaughtered and it is also devastating when innocent people are also killed in the Gaza. Why? can you just dispatch the Hamas and leave the innocents?
Peace ✌️ should be restored immediately.  Innocent  people from both sides are being  killed which is quite disturbing. 😢
"May the GOD of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob defend ISRAEL 🇮🇱.  HE is the MAKER of HEAVEN and EARTH.  HE does NOT SLEEP or SLUMBER.  GOD is NOT MOCKED, WHATSOEVER a Man SOWS that SHALL HE also REAP.  🙆🏻‍♀️🔥🕊️<br><br>HAMAS already claimed they are funded by IRAN…they are absolute TERRORISTS.  DON’T  BE DECEIVED THEY ARE EXACTLY LIKE ISIS."
"I hope Israel grows a big pair. And when the international community starts whinging Israel, tell them where to go. And if Biden is saying America has Israels back, it doesn&#39;t have Israels back."
"I suggest that the detectives check her birth certificate to see if it&#39;s legit check her social security number and what cause a lot of soldiers in the black African fictitious names birthday documents birth certificate social security number, driver&#39;s license to defraud all the federal benefit programs with one Social Security card been with the other social security card they use that number to apply for and receive credit so they live with dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde life comedian massive fraud in fact so check her out. Fingerprint her she&#39;s probably everyone working in the government needs to be fingerprinted because you have a lot of people that are working in the government who are in cults and games and the racist and they&#39;re not who they say they are defraud the country and everyone so they can steal"
"Should go back israeli to europe,usa.."
Biden was enjoying a 🍖 bbq while Americans were being killed and kidnapped why don’t you report on this?????????????
I love Israel
Civilisation is under attack from mindless blood crazed barbarians. God bless Israel
"She is just a racist soldier in the black African SUPREMIST NETWORK ARMY, BARRACK OBAMA EVEN USED A FICTITIOUS BIRTH CERTIFICATE GET A FICTITIOUS SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER FICTITIOUS DOCUMENTS TO GET A FICTITIOUS DRIVER LICENSE FICTITIOUS COLLEGE DEGREES, WALLEYE SO SHE&#39;S PROBABLY DONE THE SAME THING.<br>HE PROBABLY CHANGED HER NAME AND BIRTHDATE OF BLACK MUSLIM NETWORK ARMY SOLDIERS DO GET JOBS QHERE THEY CAN CREATE FCTITOIYS DICUMRNTS AND CHANGE RECORDS , SOLDIERS CHANGE AFRICAN MUSLIM RECORDS TO MAKE THEM LOOK BETTER THEN THEY CHANGE  ANYONES RECORD THEY THINK ARE WHITE NON MUDLIM BUT OFTEN BASM NETWORK ARMYS INNNOCENT VICTIMS ARE BIRACIAL AND MULTIRACIAL BECAUSE THEY LOOK WHITE TO HATEFUL RACIST BLACK AFRICANS AND THEIR VICTUMS DO NOT PRACTICD ISLAM."
"I have to be brutally honest here, America, this will not get better."
Hamas F&#39;d up big time if they have American hostages. Delta and Seals gonna go in and merc all them SOBs
a funny story! <br>when they are in Palestine 🇵🇸 these American citizens become Israelis
"Isreal is committing a genocide, and the USA is helping them. They also just gave Iran 6billion dollars to help hammas."
Muslims say they are peacefully religion but they keep showing us they&#39;re not.
*الله*ناصرنا 💙🏹💙
We need to state solution Palestinian authority territory. And Israelian authority territory.... hamas must stop killing women and children  innocent civilians.. Israeli forces must stop killing women and children innocent civilians..
Father have mercy on these souls that are being taken!
Laser Focused
Im pretty sure Gaza is pretty much just gone by now.
Islam is the problem
How come they never call it a terror attack when Israel&#39;s the AGGRESSOR?...
This is so messed up
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6G6MWe6IQ&amp;t=2m12s"">2:12</a><br>Here comes Mr Potato Head with his bs. America is weak and the terrorists are taking full advantage."
"My heartbreaking for the brutality suffered by Israeli civilians at the hands of Hamas.  I am sorry that Palestinian civilians are also suffering and will suffer more as they become collateral damage but Israel has the right to defend itself and now finally put an end to Hamas.<br><br>The Palestinians that will be lost as collateral damage in Israel&#39;s defense if its homeland are victims but of Hamas, not Israel.  For decades now they have willingly allowed terrorist groups as well as once the Pakestinian military to use them as human shield so that when Isreal responded to an attack with pinpoint accuracy on a target the Palestinians and terrorists could claim the Palestinian citizens killed victims of the Israelis even when it was not the Israelis that put munitions bunkers in basements of schools, rocket launchers on hospital roofs and based terrorists throughout malls and residential areas.  Over years, as missiles and warheads were launched into Israel, the ones that got past the iron dome, or all that landed in Israel before the iron dome was created, when Israel would retaliate it would announce areas that civilians should evacuate of course giving time for terrorists to evacuate and remove equipment and weapons and munitions. <br><br>Israel did this because the Israelis have singular respect of any life, no matter the origin, race, or creed of that life.  Hamas does not  respect any life, much like other terrorist groups before them, or the Palestinians government and military who once were as brutal to there own, and who now look the other way letting terrorists  be their brutal killing arm so on the international stage they can pretend to be peaceful parties who are victims of the Israelis.<br><br>Not unlike the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, where the US had long retained neutrality in the Pacific, and who did look the other way for a long while as Japan marched across Indonesia, Asia, Australia, the Japanese wokeca sleeping giant that lead eventually to their utter loss.<br><br>Israeli patience has been great but when a few days ago Hamas escalated and took the war to civilian concert goers hiding under cars and executing them at point blank range, executing infants ripped from mother&#39;s arms and toddlers napping in a crib, children kidnapped along with mother&#39;s, some shot as they could not move fast enough for their abductors, the elderly slaughtered in their homes seen as being too old to make for good hostages that could move quickly enough, Israel had enough and in all fairness they are within the moral duty to their country and their citizens to fight back and to make sure this cannot happen again.  Hamas has woken a sleeping giant of its own.<br><br>I believe, even had Hamas come over the border as well as having sleepers already in Israel activate, had they kept the fighting and killing between themselves and the IDF, Israel would have still opted for restraint even with military losses on the grounds that IDF members know they put their lives ar risk, buy the whole slaughter, brutality and actual war crimes HAMAS served changed the course of Israeli reaction in the region that will echo now for years to come.<br><br>Terrorists don&#39;t abide by rules of war and that is their defense for the brutality they hand out, but if it is found out that their were countries backing, supporting, and/or organizing this attack they need to stand in the docket in the Hague charged with the crimes Hamas carried out at their direction whether it be just Iran  or Iran in collusion with Russia or China or both.<br><br>This needs to be a wake-up call for the US.  We don&#39;t know, because of the Biden open border policy, how many sleeper cells we now have in the US, or how close we are to another attack on our own soil.  If a known entity like Hamas could plan for the months it took to orchestrate the movement of men, supplies, and munitions into Gaza under the intense intelligence of the Israelis and US and European intelligence agencies and no one  caught on, what could be staging in Mexico, Cuba, North Korea along with terrorist already in the US  that intelligence has been missing among other distractions.  May be the balloon from China  that Biden allowed to fly all across they US got the information it wanted and sent back and by the time it was out over the US it had exploded or jettisoned anything that showed what it really had been doing.  Anyone who believes it was accidently blown off course by a storm their was no record with should not be taking that as just an excuse but asking why China did nit contact the US State Department and infirm them they had a rogue balloon wandering towards the US so it could have been shot down over the pacific or  the largely empty interior if Alaska or Canada."
We want ALL Palestinian to leave America who do not denounce what the animals did to those babies and people. If you can sit here in my country defending those actions you do not belong here. Why are you here protesting in my country? Go home and do that.
"<a href=""https://youtu.be/x1tROhUxEHU?feature=shared"">https://youtu.be/x1tROhUxEHU?feature=shared</a>"
Why hasnt the US sent people in to get ours.
"Let there be no doubt, Joe Biden financed this terrorist attack. He owns this."
Crazy how the babies heads cut off story is untrue and propaganda. Only source is a fanatical IDF soldier. Biden regurgitates it with zero proof.
"You’re not an American if your home is in Israel, you’re not an American if your priorities are in Israel."
Hemas killed over 40 babies by cutting their heads off. How horrific is that. This has nothing to do with Palestine. They are just hemas shields. Palestine and Isreal need to group together against hemas
Crazy and sad most hostages have been killed 😮😢 and what can Biden do. They already told him if he intervenes they will bring the warth down on the USA 😢 <br>We don&#39;t need that issh over here. We are dealing with enough.
There is no way anyone can guarantee the safety of hostages! This is not US engagement of war! They are animals and will not follow any engagement of war!
fomenting hatred in young kids result in acts like this...both sides are guilty....!!!
"I have to say life in Israel is good. Hospital is good, house is comfortable.. it&#39;s very civilized, while the opposition is barbaric right? What a monster killing civilians like that, I&#39;m sure Israel would never such a thing in the last 60yrs of occupation."
Why no more coverage of the innocent Palestinians?
"As the resentment towards the money for ukraine grew out of control, this administration released 6 billion dollars to a nation that they knew had ill intentions. They were warned repeatedly by experts what was going to happen. And now we have a whole new target for our war machine. If you think this was an accident, you are beyond hope."
"Netanyahu needs to take a page out of Trump&#39;s book and send Hamas and Iran a couple pictures, the first  should be of the Kaaba. The second picture should be of the Al-Aqsa Mosque with a caption: release the hostages <b>now and in good condition</b> and Hamas and all Palestinians must vacate Gaza immediately.  No negotiations. Let them work out the meaning."
why usa newses watch only israel ?
They beheaded babies!! No mercy should be shown
"Anyone love the second amendment and see why it&#39;s important after this? If there&#39;s a moral it&#39;s this : don&#39;t be afraid to guard yourself, in doing so you guard the country, a country of the people, by the people, for the people."
"How does any believe Isr@31 is innocent when they clearly stole the land from the Arabs, and they been t3rr0rr1z1ng Arabs for many many years. The same people that support Ukraine should support pale$t1n3. The Arabs are the victims that have been harassed and controlled for years"
Smells like a 3rd WW
For more insight watch ... &quot;How Israeli Apartheid Destroyed My Hometown&quot;
War and oppression on Palestinian over years. Stay strong Palestine and against Israel colonizer
"So this is why the Biden administration gave Iran $6 billion in exchange for 5 Iranian American hostages and why they ran the FEMA emergency test. They, the Biden administration aka Obamas 3rd term, know war is coming. And they have to keep the world&#39;s largest money laundering scheme going even if millions die. So long as their pockets are lined with money. These people are truly sick. Deeply, deeply pure evil!"
Americans living on foreign countries are on Iran&#39;s death list
Another example of the religion of peace.
"Upon Biden&#39;s failure in Afghanistan, evil Putin saw his chance in Ukraine, evil Hamas saw its chance in Israel, and soon China will see their chance in Taiwan.<br>ALL because they&#39;ve seen the weaknesses &amp; failures under the Biden administration."
Are we going to do any Palestinian coverage or just one side?
yehhhhh  jews genocide same thing happen to themselves 50 years now doing to other <br>  WELL DONE WE THOUGHT U WELL AHAHA
They can demand Biden take responsibility all they want but I don&#39;t think Hamas is listening! They are heartless Terrorists! Wake up and smell the coffee! Until Iran is taken out this will continue as every missile being fired into Israel comes from Iran! That is a fact! You cannot ignore reality!
"Hamas members are barbarous animals, and their word means nothing. You cannot expect to bargain with them."
Make a parking lot òut of gaza and let Israel have whats left push them out
I am Indian ..and proud to be israil ....
I am indian .India help israil❤ india full support israil
"Hamas, al Qaeda, Boko Haram, ISIS, Abu sayyaf, Jemaah Isl............ their common denominator is terrorism"
Israeli has and is commuting so many acts that go against international human rights laws and the western world still supports them in committing such acts. The west sleeps with the Zionist elites. They are slowly taking over your country too America. America will no longer belong to you rather it’ll be the Zionist.
Israel ❤🇮🇱🙏
Retaliation won’t cover humiliation! Israeli army is throwing a tantrum instead of starting negotiations to librate hostages in Gaza! Israeli authorities will pay the bill when Israeli people realize the ugly reality!
"Its like here in the U.S., these Blue cities, getting wrecked by their bad policies, well, these same ppl, get what they paid for, you support Hamas, and they decided to execute mean, women and children, and you don’t think YOU are gonna pay, you have another thing coming. You may not have pulled the trigger, but your support for Hamas,is the same thing, and you are a Cockroach, that doesn’t deserve to exist."
There already trying to deflect blame on trump. Biden is as guilty as the people who did this
The Sword of war is now unsheathed in the hands of Israel ... give them what they seek  to the atrocities they made..
"The best strategy for Israel is to get some ‘revenge’ and then hold international peace talks. Possibly end up returning some land to Palestine, but will have long term peace."
Biden no adil u dok
It’s a “terror” attack if it’s against the Jews😢
Biden gave money to Iran and Iran is behind this.
I just can’t imagine babies and children being beheaded and burned alive. I want to throw up. Why can humans be so beyond evil.
Gaza gotta go.  A city of 2 mil terrorists is something no country should tolerate.
what Hamas did will be search and destroy for Israel and Americans for decades
Where’s the outcry against Israel’s inhuman attacks? How many innocent people died to exact your revenge?
"Biden?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Biden?????????<br><br><br><br>Why don’t you and yours believe Jesus died in your place so you could have new life, and He will hear your prayers?  <br><br>You guys.  The tribulation is starting.  Russia is about to destroy USA. And that’s before the first seal of revelation is opened.  Believe He died for you.  That’s it.  Growth can come later."
"Stop the propaganda. Israel maintains the<br>biggest Prison concentration camp on the planet<br>Gaza ! What you think God does not have d®<br>eyes How stupid are you?

This is what starts a war between the state of islam and the rest of the world
They are targeting more civilians than the armed Hamas.
"Get out Biden administration you are incompetent and idiots, you are responsible for this as well as Afghanistan retreat. You are cold and heartless, why did you give Iran the money"
"Airstrike on irans nuke program, wiping it and collateral out should show a bad bargain and a statement to never do it again."

"Israel knew this was going to happen they have the most elite surveillances in the world. If you take a side you miss the point. The civilians on both side are innocent. Why doesn&#39;t Netanyahu fight this war, where is he? Safe with the others who caused this turmoil. The Israeli government sacrificed their civilians to start this war. Gaza is very small, Israel has surveillance Everywhere, they saw these men parachuting in, they knew weeks prior. Egypt told them. Don&#39;t believe the lies. Israel will pull at your emotions remember the Jews started and own Hollywood. The Palestinian ppl are victims too. The average age in Gaza is 17. They have nowhere to go, they are stuck in an open air prison. Remember the Governments Started this yet they will run and hide while everyone else dies for their policies and money deals. Don&#39;t pick a side unless it&#39;s the side of the People against the World Elite Government!"
"I am an Iranian and we Iranians support Israel.<br>We, the people of Iran and Israel, will not be happy until we overthrow Islam and the Islamic government and dictatorship in the Middle East."
"NBC news- Please be objective. Israel already has its war propaganda. You should be an independent and unbiased channel. Human is an utmost value not by his country of origin, but by his nature. Arab child and Israeli child have same value. And imposing inhumane living conditions to another nation by restrictions of human rights is a crime against humanity."
"Please Israel remember there is so many innocent people there is, take care of yourself and your fellow isrealis n that includes Palestinians who don&#39;t welcome Iran n Hamas"
Honestly sounds like grounds enough to me for the U.S. to get involved directly. Like I really don’t care. Animalistic terrorism like this in 2023 should not be tolerated and an example needs to be made out of Hamas.
Americans from where? The entire western hemisphere is the Americas😀
Those citizens got what they voted for. Sheeps thought their own government would protect them. Lol😅😅😅😅😅😅
"We see the face of Islam, once again, and it is Evil. The world must support Israel against this worldly evil..DESTROY HAMAS!!!!!"
"WE NEED A NATIVE AMERICAN PRESIDENT... ONE WHO CARES ABOUT INNOCENT LIVES AND NOT POWER, GREED AND CORRUPTION. WE NEED A SPIRITUAL LEADER NOT A RELIGIOUS LEADER"
"I wonder, do these people actually think hamas gives a crap about what the US criminal regime says,,,"
Sick of hearing about other people&#39;s bulshit
Everyone should support Palestinian to recover their land from Israeli terrorist.
EVERYONE GO WATCH VOX’s LATEST VIDEO ON HOW ISRAEL AND THE BRITS STOLE FROM AND MASSACRED PALESTINIANS.
"All we can do is support Israel.  Israel is most capable to handle this.  Why is he sitting there expecting the US government to get in Israel business, go there and help Israel rather than sit on camera expecting the US to get in Israels way.  They know this far better than the US we need to support Israel in every way military and humanitarian.  Really think I would go there if it was my family rather than play politics on camera."
"There shall be no negotiations, until all hamas is gone"
"What we need to take responsibility for is our (the US and the West) actions that have lead to this situation. When you pump billions a year into a country that illegally settles disputed land and shows no desire to accept any situation other than total territorial control, this is what you get. A country beset by such political turmoil it went through 5 elections in 2022 and whose current PM has been charged with fraud, breach of trust, and bribery. Over 3.3 billion dollars a year are given to a country with a GDP of over 480 billion, crazy!"
Israel killin the all wolf
"Israel is a terrorist state<br> Hamas defends the residents of Gaza, which has been under siege for more than 15 years<br> The real reason for the conflict is that Israel has so far practiced settlement occupation and built settlements on Palestinian lands, imposed a siege on the residents of Gaza and the West Bank, and imprisoned tens of thousands of Palestinians in its prisons. Then they claim that they are looking for peace. What peace is this if you are killing Palestinians day and night??<br><br> What happened was a reaction to Israeli terrorism against the residents of Palestine<br><br> I do not justify terrorism<br> But what I mean is that terrorism only generates blood"
"Lester, how do you sleep at night?"
The world needs one world leader to put all &quot;leaders&quot;  in check. This is ridiculous
اللهم انصر فلسطين واحفظهم  واذل الاسرائيليين قلوبنا معكم ودعائنا لكم يا فلسطين ♥️🇮🇶
Biden is weak as water
"With this, Palestine and the Palestinians cemented their fate of annihilation, Israel will exact their full retaliation with all their might and no remorse anymore"
Someone stop that mad man Netanyahu! This happened under his watch he needs to resign!
Izrael is commiting an atrocity against common people. As usual.
"the US government doesn&#39;t care about hostages, Biden gave 6 BILLION $$ to Iran, the US knew when they gave that money that Iran would fund this sort of attack against Israel"
Fake news. Nothing new is happening out there. All good.
"Muslims must ask themselves..... why do people dislike them everywhere  ? Don&#39;t evade answers by hiding behind Islam or giving replies like True Muslim or True Islam.   If you have a binary view of existence being Muslims versus non believers,  people&#39;s opinions are valid."
The terrorist and the cowards are the ones attacking civilian buildings not the ones attacking military bases. Hamas just humiliated the Middle East’s “most advanced military” by taking over 11 military bases in minutes. Long live the resistance 🇵🇸
This must have been planned for a long time and how come Israel had no idea about it !
"That truly sucks for them, BUUUT didnt we loose way more in 9-11 and vowed to NEVER FORGET!? Isnt it more horrific to load a bunch of people onto planes and then crash them into buildings with thousands? We arent ever going to fix our problems by sticking our nose in everyone&#39;s buisness. It  truly sucks for them... but they&#39;ve been at it for thousands of years and they still dont learn"
Seems like they&#39;re both terroristic countries
I just ate an amazing bacon and tomato sandwich… with a lovely glass of Chardonnay.<br>Never forget 9/11
GO Israel!
the land of Israel and all the land Jerusalem belongs to Jerusalem  since 3000 years ago..since 3000 years ago the Israelis expell amori tribes..enak tribes..het tribes..ai tribes  from there..because the land of Israel and all the land of Jerusalem belongs to the Jewish people..and is the right of the Jewish people...
War is not the solution as of American president u should say stop war shame of u Biden
Bleghh those people will never stop killing eachother...theyve been at it for centuries

درود بر مردم شجاع اسرائیل . امیدوارم بعد از حماس و فلسطین سراغ خامنه ای قاتل و ادمکش بروید تا 80 میلیون ایرانی رو از ظلم اخوندها و حکومت اسلامی ازاد کنید .
"Yeah hamas has it coming after all of this BS,...killing infants is not  going to go well in a truce,...l totally get attacking military installments,....the real sad thing is that most Palestinians don&#39;t agree with hamas and their BS"
"Bet you wish Trump was in charge ....Say what you want but this would be a whole different game if he was ......Trump 2024 !!  We need a real leader more than ever ,   Secure our borders now !!!!!!!"
arent yall tired of propoganda ?
"I predict that the Biden administration will never admit that Iran was involved because of the ramifications that will occur from revealing that truth. To do so would make the Biden administration partly culpable for this Hamas attack. By not enforcing the existing sanctions against Iran, the Biden administration allowed Iran to make over 60 billions dollars in oil sales during the past 2 1/2 years. That money was then used to finance the weapons and training that went into this Hamas attack. Truth be told, this would never had happened in a Trump administration."

Ya speak about hamas as if their people who didn&#39;t suffer enough under isreal rule. Both countries are wrong and both countries need of descipline before the US feels like they doing right and end up bringing war to our shores 😢
Why is the reporter taking sides?? 🙄🙄🙄
Israel created Hamas to fight the PLO inside Gaza.  But Frankenstein&#39;s monster always gets loose.  Turns out Frankenstein just isn&#39;t as smart as he thinks he is.
Pay the ransom. Biden got billions ready for Ukraine.
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
"Hamas beheads toddlers, women and children and now they talk about inhuman treatment. Karma."

This is what happens when your citizens dont have guns
Watch out when the media decides who is the good and the bad
Gaza will become a new parking lot.
I like how they dressed him in a weekend warrior outfit to look like he is really rolling up his sleeves to bring you this new episode of the international hunger games.
We are left alone to fight so buckle up buttercup let’s go💯💯‼️
Prayers for the Palestinian people 🇵🇸
Well that sure did lack balance. How about really speaking to Palestinians that are suffering the war crimes perpetuated by racist Israel.  Yes we got the part that what Hamas has done was horrible... how many times will you tell that story and not the story of what happen before and what is happening afterwards... typical right wing media.
This is BIDEN‼️‼️‼️💯💯 ITS ENOUGH ‼️‼️‼️💯💯💯💯💯💯 either step up or get OUT‼️‼️
Easy solution to avoid bloodshed. Free Palestine
I HAVE NO COMPASSION ANYMORE FOR PALESTINE...ZERO......
"How will the Biden administration get the hostages released? By caving into to the demands of a political death cult ? It is beyond heart wrenching but short of giving into the death cult there is little to be done in the immediate future. I do fear that the hostages will never be released. Nevertheless, I pray God will help the powers that be to somehow find a way to bring all of the hostages home❤"
This is crazy I wonder what is next for us the purge ?
men are bad war is bad. Weapons are bad.   That’s the gist of this thing.  I have Israeli ancestry and I am just blown away in emotions 😢😢😢😢😢😢 so devastating. War is the stupidest devastating low life acts of man.
200 innosent children&#39;s are killed by Israel terrorists. Is it true?Whether killed this innosent children&#39;s?Do you have any answers?Don&#39;t think all Americans are ahole.Lot&#39;s American humanity still alive.
What a shame stand up AMERICANS ‼️‼️‼️❤️
"If they donot call in peace, then the not sure how many people will lose their lives. So sad"
Israel is not the victim. They are the oppressors and clearly always will be. Shutting off water electricity to Gaza ? Announcing they’ll be a genocide ? You can’t handle when you get retaliated against for your own crimes ? Those deaths were on Israel hands. And they had it coming
It took him 4 days to come out and speak took him that long to learn how to read his lines.
"Hamas beheaded babies! That is evil!!!!!  How can anyone support that????  But, many college students do, After watching reports on atrocities committed by Hamas, They are fine with it!!! What are they being taught in the universities???????"
My heart breaks for these people instead of a BBQ let’s help them out breaks my heart ❤️ 😢
I stand with Israel from India. India🇮🇳 stand with 🇮🇱 unconditional.
That plug at the end of each NBC video with that soulless commentator is just sickening. This dude has zero emotions.
Islam - A religion of peace 😑
"Lester sounds like he has a cold and he goes into a hospital, a bomb shelter spreading germs all over the place!"
I love how you guys report for one side...forgetting all the atrocities the side you&#39;re reporting for has done for the past 50 years! Such pathetic reporting!
"What do expect from the people who were put under pressure. At some point they&#39;ll push back and it won&#39;t be nice. The problem with the Americans is they proclaim themselves as the peace maker,but we know that what they are doing is selective peace making.<br><br><br>Which means if their friends are the ones on the attack, they&#39;ll keep quiet. But when their friend gets punished suddenly everyone has to bet an eye. That is hypocrisy and will lead us to war soon"
LOL @ those donkeys who said they hold Biden accountable to bring back the captives. This was all Israel’s fault. Such a lack of intelligence after being warned BY EVERYONE. This was so true that it’s Israel’s 9/11.. true because Israel is just as much to blame as hamas is. They needed this to start a war. Both sides are disgusting and the Israelites don’t deserve this. Unfortunately the president of Israel’s is as currupt as the bush administration is for 9/11. You all disgust me including the media
Palestinians have the right to defend themselves.
While young girls are getting doused with gasoline and set on fire Biden goes to a Bbq. Biden is to blame with the Afghanistan debacle now they are using are weapons against  Israel and also giving 6 billion what kind of man are we dealing with?
God is with Israel.
This video is very touching but I wish that everyone can realize how biased this video is. The jews want to do to the Palestinians what Hitler did to them. They mistreats Christians and Muslims (look it up) everyday for the past many many years. I just hope that all seize fire and get along afterwards.
"Have some of you seen the comical Russian response, where Russia claims that this situation must be resolved quickly following international law?  Will they withdraw from Ukraine to demonstrate what they expect others to do?  🤣🤣🤣🤣"
Israel owns America no matter what.
I can&#39;t understand how the Israel army could let this happen. Where were they?  Why did they have no knowledge?  Where&#39;s their surveillance?  Their informants?  Why didn&#39;t they see any of this coming?  How come they didn&#39;t know Hamas had 10s of thousands of rockets in Gaza?  <br>It&#39;s like the army just forgot these people have sworn to die trying to wipe Israel off the map.
"One of the worst things about this war is that the US has sent billions and billions of US dollars as &quot;aid&quot; to Iran, Binden sent another 6 billion last month, who funds Hamas.  Looks like were being played once again. The fake corporate media will not tell you this.  Please do research... its past time to understand that you&#39;ve been lied to."
Nothing to expect from western narrative<br>They are the ones who massacred native Americans and build a state on their burned skulls<br>They are the ones who invaded Iraq and massacred its people based on the lie of “weapons of mass destruction”<br>They are the ones who massacred Palestinians in 1948 in the name of bible to establish a fairy tale “home land”<br>And since then the Palestinian death toll never stopped <br>They are the true barbaric terrorists but with good media and influence <br>Long live Palestine !! <br>Fight for your freedom!
so it&#39;s terror attack and what Israel doing is what exactly
"Anchors face is like Defence minister of Israel, so this makes the news more authentic 😂"
"I dont care if the admin is calling the families. It’s horribly sad, but just calling you does nothing."
You are NBC are terrorists too..... Take your Israel to US
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6G6MWe6IQ&amp;t=2m53s"">2:53</a> because they don&#39;t have any new info??? There is no release they aren&#39;t negotiating with the terrorists that&#39;s what created this problem."
This is I hope the beginning of the end of Hamas and IRAN
"Who ever believe and go back with these countries sure they will be on street in one day USA, CHINA, Extra.. They always really not support for humanity based on benefits. Think and step with them.  example affected by these countries .. pak, srilanka, ukrain, now one more added israel."
There not American
"Jeezus... do you really need to show such graphic violence?  Sure we see it in movies, but this is real life for God&#39;s sake."
Lol. NBC what a joke. There&#39;s Youtubers that have 10 times the views that you guys have......go away?
"Seeings Hillary Clinton and her buddies were funding self proclaimed &quot;Isis recruiters&quot;, I think they should be held accountable in this too. Pretty sure they have their hands involved with this terrorist attack just like Paris soccer games attacks, Tashfeen, Farooks and the Vegas attack too."
"Lol, biden&#39;s a twit. He&#39;ll forget what he said minutes after says it, then will get lost trying to leave before he finishes the speech. This wouldn&#39;t have happened under a strong president who shows the world strength instead of a president like the one we have now."
Bring back President Trump !!
Prayer for Israel and peace 🙏🙏🙏
"&quot;... do you worry about your fellow soldiers who were captured?&quot;   <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6G6MWe6IQ&amp;t=06m51s"">06:51</a>  Is that what passes for reporting these days?"
The guy was working as security yet hid in the woods??? Brave 🙄
AIN&#39;T religion great?
❤ God bless Israel Israeli people Benjamin Netanyahu and IDF intelligence of the IDF soldiers God bless you and God give you strategy  wisdom protection and Victory❤
I hate to say it but the hostages are dead men and women walking.  Gaza needs to be glassified and it&#39;s that simple.
It’s a shame that all of these young ppl are fooled into joint the military game… it’s never been about democracy
"Regrettably, this huge loss of lives and unabated violence is a sad reminder of more than seven decades of illegal foreign occupation, aggression and disrespect for the international law, including UNESCO resolutions.<br>The 16 years of illegal blockage of Gaza continued to raise questions over the applicability of international law and fundamental freedoms of the innocent civilian population. As a result, efforts to normalize the area is breeding violence."
wow!  great reporting!!!  I&#39;m usually writing negative things about MSM but NBC got this one right!!!  Very informative and zero bias.   thank you!  keep up the great work!
i hate humaity.   people are cheering hamas did this. that is just disgusting nasty etc..
I don’t expect America to go to war over the lives of a few Americans
No money or arms for hostages. None.
Weakness can be smelled.<br>Welcome to Brandon&#39;s🤡World<br>One unconditional surrender &amp; two wars which never would have happened on Trump&#39;s watch
"Israel has been begging for this. It’s horrible for the individuals, but on a macro level, they’re simply paying the toll."
Biden has failed to protect Americans. He sits around without offering retaliation for lost American lives. He needs to go.
What an incompetent administration.
Hamas and Palestinian were provoked since Kushner moved the embassy from Palestine to Jerusalem
stop pouring it on you fake fools we don&#39;t believe for a minute what you say where are the Hamas voices speaking why can&#39;t i hear the good guys for once .
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6G6MWe6IQ&amp;t=1m03s"">1:03</a> this is an apartment building.  That is not Hamas.  This is just about revenge and creating even more hatred and a more inflamed Hamas and Palestinian people.  The goal is fill them with hatred of their occupying oppressors so they lash out.<br><br>The far right wing government of Israel wants to annex all of Palestine, illegally of course.  America will sign off on it as well because it&#39;s also what we want.  Welcome to the West.  Aren&#39;t we the best?"
"I have no pity for destroying terrorists and Islamic scum. Filthy, perverted, dirty religion."
How about locking down Iranian funds and cyber attacks on anything connected to Iran.
"Sorry Lester, not interested. You should consider moving back to Mill Valley."
Sent the LGBTQRST activist Biden to fight Hamas😂
✝️🙏😪❤
"I pray for all civilians in both sides to be safe and not be caught in the middle, let peace and love win all our hearts.<br><br><br>We need a peaceful world."
"If they let the Ukrainians fight the Russians in the war, why don’t they let the Palestinians fight back agains israel? i don’t understand why people love israel so much and hate Palestinians. Just like how they let Ukrainians fight Russians, let the Palestinians fight back. Or just peace instead."
"12th century response to a 21st century problem. Other than entire obliteration, this isn&#39;t going away until everyone talks at a table."
The problem is not the people or Israel or Palestinians it the two old Dictator prime Minister for both sides. Biden need to cancel all money and weapons for both sides until the two Dictator prime Minister step down from their position and can&#39;t have nothing to do with government anymore. Biden can cancel this war tomorrow by cutting of the money. Oh yeah it time for america to but military base on both sides and treat both side fair and equal their is know more choosing side because both sides been doing bad things.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6G6MWe6IQ&amp;t=1m44s"">1:44</a> killer is the devil himself … what a coward the MF . RIP ! so sorry 🇺🇸"
Horrifying
"I guarantee DEVGRU and Delta have already been spun up and are in country, along with CIA and NSA assets. We will never announce it, but they are there."
Israil and america big terror in the world ..america killed most30 million peaple
Lies
They are gone. Negotiations are a waste of time.  Hamas doesn&#39;t care about thier own lives much less the hostages they take.
"Biden ain’t gonna do squat. You’re in Israel by choice, why would the USA bail u out. You will get the same support as Maui"
"Long live free Palestine!!! Hamas is a creation of Israel, just like the Maras are a creation of the US."
This is what happens when you let Obama and Biden convince your government to take your guns. Oh wait! Israel is lifting SOME gun restrictions. They need to be handing out AKs from pick-up trucks.
"There is not even an ambassador to Israel because of Republican obstruction in Congress.  I&#39;m sure President Biden has ordered fhe US military to do everything possible to recover the hostages.  If they act hastily, it could get the hostages killed.  They must be deliberate and use a certain amount of caution to avoid such an outcome."
Unfortunately the United States has lost understanding of what war has to be. You cannot fight a civilized war as there is no such thing. Let’s see how the bleeding hearts feel when it happens here again. Plain and simple the hostages are not coming back. Doing what needs to be done cannot be held up by hostages. Hamas are cowards as they hide behind their own family.
I am sad to see that so many innocent lives are being lost. It&#39;s sad but what the western world need to understand this isn&#39;t new when it comes to the war between the country Israel and Palestine .  This goes all the way back to the Balfour Declaration in 1917 when the Palestine  people was forced out what is known as the modern Israel today.   We must read history book and book detailing historical events and not depend on the News to tell the story.  There will be no peace in what is known now as the Middle East until the end times.  This is biblical prophecy some don&#39;t believe but that&#39;s okay.
European colonisers extremest
Time for the crying to stop and br8ng on the shock and awe of the IDF.
God bless the IDF
"No place for terrorist in the word, go on Israel.<br>Dont give up <br><br>We stand with Israel<br>We pray for Israel"
Zionist are animals
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
"I pray for Israel through this conflict, and that all these hostages are reunited safely. Really horrific what Hamas has done, this is a true act of terrorism."
They are spreading lies free Palestine from this racists white supremacists European colonisers extremest calling themselves Israel settler colonisation occupation project colonizing occupying the holy lands free Palestine from the zionist colonizers
"Let&#39;s see now. Since this &quot;mini 9/11&quot;...<br>Border is out of the news.<br>Ukraine is out of the news.<br>Hunter is out of the news.<br>8,500+ children missing at the border is out of the news.<br>Biden Crime impeachment is out of the news.<br>Horrible economy is out of the news.<br>Worldwide illegal immigrant invasion is out of the news.<br>Speaker of the House drama is out of the news.<br>Trump is out of the news.<br><br>All good news for Israel&#39;s best friend- America.<br>Don&#39;t even think a Deep State Government wouldn&#39;t sacrifice its own people as collateral damage to retain power. Don&#39;t think that&#39;s possible? Take a closer look at our own 9/11. It&#39;s completely possible."
Joe Biden......GUESS what Iran just did with the SIX BILLION you gave them last week!!!   ARE YOU REALLY THAT STUPID????
"God please watch over Israel, those peaceful folks dont deserve War coming their way  🙏🏾"
How can they easily call hamas as a terrorists while they themselves are occupying their lands and have no conscious that what they have been doing to Palestinians for more than 70 years
Israel been killing Palestinian for the past 60 years . Thats super sad let’s all free Palestine there is a woman is suffering that long .
thanks Slo Biden - U r a wicked fool ! …. keep giving money &amp; loosening sanctions to the financiers - Iran!

If different whn the jews are doing the same thing to thr Palestine ppl <br>Now feel the medication uv been fwwding rhe gaza ppl
It wouldn’t have happened Biden if it weren’t for you sending Iran 6 Billion.
&quot;Let&#39;s roll!&quot;
Hamas is just like isis <br>Barbarians.
Bidens fault
20 Americans missing? Dead and forgotten possibly. That&#39;s literally an act of war. Let&#39;s go
"President confirming dead Americans is also confirmation that WW III is actually  about to begin. Between Russia, Venezuela, North Korea &amp; China we are 100% going to end the current way of the world. Just as the African Kingdoms of Mansa Musa &amp; far back as the times of Pharos to the Mongolian Dynasty, Roman Empire, Aztecs, Mayans and countless Era’s in recorded history…there will be an entire shift of power &amp; another evolutionary shift and the survivors will go on to birth generation after generation w/ideology that we could never follow as we currently are. No world wars, just the people under 1 government &amp; 1 race, the human race. Religion may carry on but not out of greed or bloodshed to push an agenda. Creating a chance for every nation to combine their power in the name of conscious evolution. That will open the door for technological advancement instead of each nation working against each other as we do now. I am still blessed to be apart of the learning process humanity must inevitably continue though. When we are finally synchronized as not just people but a person…we will take that next leap. No 100 year secret weaponry projects, No spy-ops to see how far the “enemy” can launch a rocket. Instead putting those resources together to build something greater. Because, somewhere in the universe there are 10-20 quintillion (1 trillion x 1 quadrillion = 1 Quintillion) planets and maybe 10% harbor intelligent life. That means 10 quadrillion planets have millions of species living on them w/ at least 1 of those species being intelligent. Spending eons evolving or maybe just now reaching the dawn of their intelligence. Either way they too will go through what we’ve gone through here on earth to some capacity. My point being what’s happening is nothing new in the grand scheme of the cosmos. Alike cosmology, our understanding of physics on earth is dawning, that’s how far we are as a species, but we too will learn, evolve from our mistakes &amp; only then will we truly be freed consciously &amp; when we are at a full understanding of the universe our successors will know that just like we look at barbarism as a part of human evolution, we too are the barbarians. <br><br>If you like this post shoot me a reply. I’m interested in learning about others views regarding the future of humans &amp;  where we truly stand on the grand scheme of the Cosmos. Do we eviscerate humanity entirely via WWIII nuclear extinction level events ? &amp; if you agree or disagree w/my viewpoints lemme know why as I am always extremely eager to expand my knowledge &amp; viewpoints! Peace &amp; love ❤"
I guess NBC isn&#39;t throwing Israel under the bus just yet.  I give them a couple days...
PALESTENIANS and their authorities have to be blamed for this… don’t tell me you did no know what’s was being planned by this terrors organizations.  You allowed this terrorist to adoctrínate your children with hate and violence.
Not being political but if president trump was in the office this would never had happened and all these illegals from 160 countries we don’t know who they are?
I thought Donald Trump and Jarod Kushner solved this problem?
You can’t retaliate if you’re the one who started it. Israel is a great evil and must fall.
Joe Funded This War By Giving Iran 6 Billion Dollars !
"Are you for real, wow now they are the victims wow it seem we still in the red head time"
"Why doesn&#39;t this fake news MSNBC really tell the truth, and report on how Joe Biden was the one who funded this horrible act,  along with his stinking Democrats they sent taxpayers cash to a terrorist regime that used that money to fund this, Biden is accountable for this and should be charged with treason"
Easy to win a gun battle against unarmed people
Islamophobia or Anti-Semitism. You choose 😂
Amen ! God Protect Israel and give them the Resolve to End Hamas once and For All !...Terrorist Should Never Be Allowed In Israel Again !
Israelis got what they deserve
Only teriost are Jews taking over land illegally
"This is extremely sad. I&#39;m not sure you can demand a US armed response though. And with great respect, I submit that global peace is worth prudent action that may or may not include rescuing hostages. As a son I would say the same as this man on TV. I would  want my mother back as well. But they are not more special than anyone else. There&#39;s more at stake than just the hostages now."
"The rockets are being fired from all over Gaza. From roofs of buildings, from mosques, from parks, from hospitals. Should Israel let their citizens die to rocket attacks to preserve the lives of Hammas families? If they don&#39;t destroy the attackers, they are choosing to let their people die. If they do destroy the attackers, they do so knowing the civilians of Gaza die. <br><br>This is a like a psychological train problem. Regardless of if Israel doesn&#39;t destroy the rocket firing position or does destroy the firing position civilians will die. Regardless of which side dies, both are useful to Hamas propaganda. So really the only choice for Israel is whose innocent people die. Regardless of their decision innocent people die, and Hamas gains more support from their terrorist state allies and the Palestinian people. <br><br>The deaths in Gaza are entirely on Hamas. They created a cache 22 situation that has worked for them in the past in generating public support both from terrorist states allies and the west. They have been very successful in the past influencing western media, citizens, and politicians using this cache 22 strategy on Israel. It works because the terrorist states who support them don&#39;t value the lives of Jewish people at all, and the west values all life. <br><br>I think the west as a whole generally knows how Hamas operates now. Hopefully the fools who still support the wrong side will see reason this time. If not, they should be sanctioned and investigated the same as supporters of Al-qaeda and ISIS in the past."
Send americans troops tanks rockets foods medics water to srael then.
"Ya&#39;ll gotta understand this, Israel isn&#39;t just any country, it is the nation of the Lord Most High, the God of Hosts. <br>You mess with the daughter of God, you get what you get. Period. Israel is God&#39;s nation. You don&#39;t mess with it.<br>God bless Israel, and Peace to Jerusalem. Amen."
Jesus is coming soon. Repent from your sins before it&#39;s too late.
"Hopefully, both sides will get tired of killing each other. And may their gods have mercy on their souls."
They want Biden to find them...Biden dnt even know where he is what are they thinking
"Why is it the responsibility of the US government to ensure the security of Americans visiting Israel?  It should have been the responsibility of the Israeli government to ensure the safety of his citizens and visitors.  Obviously, they failed at it, and heads will roll."
It was Israel self made attack to just to take over more piece of land uffff 😢
you are not calling Israeli terrorism against innocent Palestinians who grab Palestinian land in 1947. it is  your double standard media coverage against Palestinian humanity.
When Biden said kids are being killed he was talking about Isreal right?
Welcome from Palestine
Biden will never do enough. He’s too incompetent and this crisis does not benefit biden or put any money in his pockets. He doesn’ have the capacity to care about anyone but himself.
"Remember that Joe Biden unfroze about 6 Billion to a state sponsor of terrorism, Iran, and Obama sent billions of cash on planes to them. The globalists want chaos so they can invade our communications and justify locking people up especially MAGA supporters who they already have called domestic extremists. Watch out for an attack here in the United States they will definitely use as justification for lockdowns and  putting people in concentration camps. RESIST these people from taking your Freedoms."
No sympathy for Palestinian 🇮🇱🙌🇮🇱🙌🇮🇱
Never say this species is advanced. No one acts like this whose brain is in an advanced state of being.
"Make Biden accountable for the release of hostages they say ? He can’t even hold his own bowels , and wears a diaper ! Good luck with him helping !"
Nice of the Carlton Hotel taking the opportunity to advertise during that interview.
This is a long time coming...the Geneva Convention was clear. You ignore injustice and allow people to continue to be encroached upon. Literally they murked a journalist because it was a day that ended in -y. They disrupt Palestinians&#39; holy days. Palestinians have a right to exist. Stop sharing only one side of the story. Stop acting like this is &quot;war&quot;. This is people who simply want to live and not continue to be kicked out of their homes. Hashtag: the Geneva Convention is the whole story... look how much land has been stolen. This is crazy...the reality is Israel has also been showing anti-Christian sentiments as well. The world powers need to do better. This is wrong...
This world is so evil
What an awful time to have a weak leader Joe Biden.
Jimmy carter happy before he dies he gets to not be the worst president ever.
They choose to live in those third world countries and they know the threats.
Why are u there ! Lester !
"Why is it  taken so long for Biden to do  something  the whole World is Watching  this children caught up in the middle  od this , What&#39;s  the hold up Help these People ❤ God Sees  all !!!"
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Very horrifying conflict...but fully predictable...you can&#39;t force millions of native humans off their  original territory and put a wall up...what do you expect is going to happen over time..this is a crazy situation that was created through greed and unhinged use of power without any thoughts of consequence..
Israel can’t win this conflict with fire power. They’ve tried that for the past 8 years.
Israel will smile again
Israeli officials are calling for the use of a tactical nuke to wipe Gaza off the map
1 dead Israeli is equivalent to 1000 Palestinian<br>While 1 American is equivalent to 1 nation<br>Gaza is in serious danger
I feel for these families but HOW do you expect the U.S. to instantly free only Americans in this craziness???
Wow. What about Palestine  innocent people continuously death  of Israeli attacks?
"Uh... Oh... O ... My ... <br>.. and then.<br>Have you ever think what have you done afterall past time, will eventually back to yourself.<br>While enjoying the joy you may forgot all you have done before.<br><br>This is To anyone whoever you are.<br><br>&quot;Sorry for what we all have done before&quot;."
This is part of the plan to go Global. This is a horrendous and visious attact. This is part of the distruction our and other Countries are creating. The same thing will happen here.
"US tax payers money should not be used to support Apartheid &amp; Occupation state.<br>Gazza a city of 2.5 million is made of refugees driven from all over Israel &amp; Gazzans have every right to drive out all occupants of illegal settlements &amp; to take their land.<br>Young people who used their paragliders to get behind enemy lines are courageous people who will ultimately win this war of liberation against occupiers with their F35&#39;s.<br>Illegal settlers are armed &amp; dangerous, not civilians, &amp; part of occupation."
"Get the creeps,  now."
OMG ISRAEL 🇮🇱 giving a good listen to HAMAS now!!
I stand with you shoulder to shoulder. <br>We will never be able to resolve this. <br>I don&#39;t have a answer .<br>I get it from both perspectives. <br>I do know that this is not the answer. <br>I feel for the civilians  on both sides.<br>But I have to give Israel  by unwavering support. <br>They want to live in peace. <br>Arabs want to wipe the jewelry off the face of the earth. <br>Long live Israel!
"Just go in, might as well."
These people never learn
not often an nbc viewer on its politics however we unite when its this.
The guy who funded this madness making bold condemnations. The epitome of hypocricy.
Lester and nbc should stick to interviewing celebrities  why dont they talk about biden giving iran the money to do this
Why would a smaller nation attack a bigger one?<br>Palestine needs to be absorbed.
Democrats are dangerous than Hamas
How y&#39;all in pent houses? Peace to the people!!
"Oh look! More American taxpayer dollars and American missiles from Amercian &quot;Defense&quot; Companies killing thousands for the greed of the military industrial complex.<br><br>Don&#39;t be fooled! It&#39;s all black flag operations by America so we can continue extorting taxpayers by starting wars.<br><br>Americans won&#39;t stand for it any longer! Down with the empire, let democracy reign.<br><br>Look to Kennedy for our future, free from corrupt political parties and lobbyists 🎉🎉"
Joe Biden has blood on his hands.He gave Irian the money to use for the attack on Isreal.

"If people dont believe in God,now is the time,the bible speaks of these war&#39;s in the end time&#39;s to come."

Targeting hamas? You mean targeting apartment complexes

"My heart is broken for the victims, but my birth country is experiencing the same problem, but US government never helpfully helped us either."
If you think that it will never happen here you should seriously reconsider how you see things this gangster and chief along with his band of corrupt tyrants have been paving the way for it for years and you want to surrender your 2nd amendment rights go right ahead surrender your rights but don&#39;t surrender mine and when crap hits the fan and you have no chance to protect your family and friends and self you will be the first to get behind the ones who didn&#39;t that to is the worst kind of coward and you know it
It&#39;s American missiles send to Ukraine 😂😂 idiots Zelonsky is fooling you 😂
Biden must have left the barbecue early…
Too bad they can&#39;t protect themselves with guns.
As soon as the hamas rockets are fired the launch site detection should take them out fast.
Islam = evil.  How could anyone think otherwise?
"This is so shifty. How did they not see 15 breaches of the boarder!? Why did these barbarians run amok for over 5 hours!? Hamas can plan this for 1 year, 1000 operatives but yet Israel know which apartment blocks in Gaza harbour terrorists!?<br><br>I smell B.S."
"Start to arm your citizens Or would you rather be slaughtered in a air raid bunker , unarmed you are guaranteed to be a victim and possibly die"
Thats what happened to ancient Israel too. They got raided on the sabbath
"CIA and This administration, at that our entire government has blood on its hands all over this mess, this is exactly the type of work the CIA AND OUR CORRUPTED GOVERNMENT WILL DO…"
"I got to tell you I&#39;m disappointed in your coverage. I am a non-biased, white guy from Florida, I thought your coverage was terrible.  You failed to mention any of the atrocities committed by Israel on Gaza or the 300 plus dead Palestinian children.  The pro Israeli news coverage is just absurd.  I am not anti-semitic and I am not pro-Palestinian, but over the last decade he Israelis have oppressed the Palestinians like no other group of people on the planet. The Gaza strip doesn&#39;t even control its own water or electricity or food supply, Israel controls everything about their life.  The fact that Israel thought they could get away with treating people this way without a response is just ludicrous"
Wars are never the answer. Violence almost always brings more violence. Palestinian face violence everyday but most media outlets never talk about it because it doesn&#39;t pay their bills and it doesn&#39;t align with popular narrative.
R I P🙏🙏🙏
"NBC show’s extraordinary bias in this report. Emphasising the atrocities of Hamas over and over again, and only briefly touching on the chaos, bloodshed and mayhem Israel is inflicting on innocent Palestinians. Israel has promised to annihilate the Gaza Strip “if it takes a day, or a week.” Israel has bombed apartments, mosques, hospitals and schools showing a complete disregard for human rights. Humanitarian organisations are begging for access to Gaza, but the ruthless, blood thirsty, psychopathic Israeli forces have not given it to them. It is completely reprehensible to produce this biased coverage. NBC - inspiring world war 3."
Thank you Joe Biden for enabling Iran&#39;s support of Hamas and its attacks on Israel.
Europeans are delighted that a certain group left Europe after the Second World War.  At least some small European country is not being destroyed by ewes.

Impeach Biden!!!
Should get the stories and plight of the Palestinian too....
I do not for one moment believe that Israel&#39;s intelligence forces had no clue this was going to happen---they have the most competent intel in the world. This is what Netanyahu needed to get his legal troubles washed away &amp; &quot;unite&quot; Israel behind him in annihilating Gaza. Neither side has the moral high ground here.
What side are we rooting for this  time? Can someone tell me quickly so I can update my bio
Oh... a new war! Look over here Israel!😂 now they will be asking for American tax dollars 😂! I guess Ukraine was getting Boring 😅😂 we need to be distracted and entertained as American sinks in front of your eyes
HAMAS IS A TERORIST AND PURE EVIL!!!
Isn&#39;t issi did that with hostage saw video beheaded their captive including Americans citizens and not even trump and rest of Americans government never stops ISSI including 911 including stop Iran regime and Syria regime still in control today including tailban when every NATO alliance countries could stop all this including north Korea China somila and Russia and all the middle East including America and yet wouldn&#39;t have any terrors by any terrorist group and communism countries
I got no time to be sad for pple that cheer beheaded babies.
"Sorry folks. You go to a hot spot, you do so at your own risk. We, of course, support Israel. Individuals have to live with their decisions."
Pray for the captives like one of them is yours. God does hear our prayers.

How can they demand America do more for the families? Have they been sent by America?
Only showing Israel not what happened in Palastnian
Funny how Israel has so much video coverage yet the most expensive war in history happening over in Ukraine only has a couple flip phone vids of rusty tanks and abandoned buildings.🤔
"Hey Americans, are you ready for the draft?"

God protect 🇮🇱
Everything is Bidens fault. He gave 6 millions of dollars to Iran to support the terrorists groups around the world.  USA FAULT.  BIDEN&#39;S FAULT.
Just something else they gonna blame Biden for
"I can’t help but think of the ripple effect this will have for decades to come, horrific on both sides smh 🤦"

You don’t attack one of our friends and get away with it. Glad Palestine’s in ruins now!

Hamas is terrorist no doubt... but the most terrorist in the world is Israel itself including USA
"Hamas &amp; ISIS r so full of hate instead of gratitude. Afghans &amp; Morocco quake victims &amp; Libya has over 10,000 who wouldve loved to live in Gaza. Eye for an eye makes us all blind💜🙏💜🙇‍♀️"
There&#39;s gotta be some hamas people here in the USA ..  someone should check on them. Ya know? Check on them.

Palestine is free and proud by the will of whoever he wants and father by father
Its always the innocent that pay the most for these  War Mongers .All nations  are guilty of  these  acts of terror.
Netanyahu burned his own people alive to regain his country...
This is only the beginning only what is hidden is better
"Hamas are terrorists, let there be no doubt"
لسا ما شافو قضب المسلمين كل هاذا قليل
who saw the video of a hamas soldier even shooting and killing dogs
The little gaza ghetto. Why don&#39;t they put them out of their misery. Whats the point of it? To breed pitbulls?
"I thought battles were fought between and amongst armed military. When did house to house terrorizing of unarmed civilians, babies, grandmas become a casual reality of war?"
"Should we really put our American soldiers in harms way? Israel is very capable of winning this war. Israel won the 6 day war without any U.S help in 1967. And in 2023 they are more able. Israel no longer needs USA military or USA political military failed policy tactics. This is Israel&#39;s opportunity to show the world that they are truly sovereign, and no longer need the USA."
What would drive Hamas to do this?
America doesn’t negotiate with terrorists.
What is Biden waiting for???
Massive attack lead by terrorist regime Israel against the owner of the land and the right
It&#39;s bizarre all these commenters appealing to a god or prayers to sort this out. Do you really think that religion is the answer to a problem essentially caused by religions?
the only terrorist here is israel and NBC fake news
"The reason he is reporting on the Israel suffering is because evil , murdering , cowardly Hamas terrorists attacked innocent people and children.  That’s why"
No one finds it strange that the whole country got an alert warning then 3 days later a global crisis happens
"There is no good side, both sides are &quot;evil&quot;, and I feel for the innocent civilians stuck on both sides."
"The Holy Land. One of the bloodiest places on earth for centuries. A bit ironic, wouldn&#39;t you say?"

"Hebrews 10:26-31 <br>26 For if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, <br>27 But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. <br>28 He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: <br>29 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? <br>30 For we know him that hath said , Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people. <br>31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."

"&quot;Retaliation&quot; aka &quot;committing war crimes &quot; , which funded by the American tax payers"
Another Biden success story.  That old man and his administration need to go.  3 years of stupid decisions.  It needs to end next year.
"People celebrated the killing of innocent people and families in Israel.<br>Now, others are celebrating the killing of innocent people and families in Gaza. <br>Peace be upon every single innocent human being in every corner of the world"
The American/Israel citizens had a choice on where they choose to live. Most of the kidnapped and dead did not. You mixed citizens decided to accept the risks of living in a country where their safety depends on Israel military situational awareness. The american govt is NOT responsible for your individual lives. To have American soldiers risk their lives in the thousands to protect marginal citizens who had a choice of where to live is not an American right! Your choice....your responsibility.!Heartbreaking but thats the brutal honest truth!
"How can the President gat anyone out of Israel, there are no flights in or out, we have two churches here in Missouri that have congregation 43 out of one Baptist Church that can’t come too their home in America<br>Blaming a sitting president is not right, he has no control over flights in or out of Israel"
The people of Gaza have already lost and will continue to lose
Where us the dome protection
Land occupation and brutality against natives is also terrorism!! Palestinians are fighting for their rights. Humanity stands with them!
"It&#39;s awful to see how many innocent people have to suffer on both sides of this conflict because of the rigid hatred of their leaders.<br><br>I do wonder though when we can talk about how Israel is at least half responsible for this war given the horrific way they&#39;ve treated Palestinians (not that they are innocent either). Hamas terrorism is evil, the way Israel has treated Palestinians is evil, and war is evil. I hope this conflict ends for everyone involved. 🙏🏽"
Remember when the Palestinian Gaza citizens danced in the streets and celebrated the US 911 deaths ☹️
"“Freedom Fighters” don’t drop out of the sky “Fortnight Style” to deliberately seek out the softest civilian targets they can find to terrorize, abduct, r•pe &amp; execute, and it is deluded and wicked to think there is anything that justifies such actions."
This is what happens when your government doesn’t mind its own business
Israel seems to be violating the terms of occupation. That does not surprise me after what the world has witnesses in this 17-year occupation.
Imagine if you said &quot;Those animals&quot; talking about Israelis 😅
Palestine and Muslims United
Way us has israeil bak waya us saport israil  whdut inwastagat

"Trump cut off money to the Palestinians, and to I ran, Biden gave them money to start this war. We need better leadership. Biden is not up for the job. Step Down!!!!!"
Poor man he can bearly talk
"Biden is not going to help them at all; just like he left Americans in Afghanistan, and all other Americans around the world."
I stand with Palistine
"Somebody explain to me how/why Hamas would be Live streaming, or sending video&#39;s directly to NBC? <br>It doesn&#39;t make any sense.<br>And then were supposed to believe that NBC somehow found family/friends of supposedly captured people. <br>It makes even less sense."
That mofo cant find the tip of his nose
he started it now is going to salve the wounds of isreal biden is a hamas supporter
IF THE BARBARIC HAMAS execute their Israeli and and other foreign national hostages... What will be Hamas reaction if Israel and other countries will retaliate by  killing tens of thousands of TERRORIST HAMAS AND THEIR PALESTINIAN SUPPORTERS? THIS IS AN EYE FOR AN EYE BATTLE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL.
"Im not pro for either side. 10x&#39;s the amount of people have actually died on both sides by now, then what is being reported. Its sad and terrible 😔"
So thats where all those weapons that were left in Afghanistan went.
900 in Gaza? About 2 million to go
"That pos &quot;president &quot; cant even speak from the heart , reads from a prepared speach for him while he&#39;s been busy on vacation,  AGAIN."
"You and Obama, did this . This ministration has so much blood on their hands. I will guarantee you God will hold you accountable."
The way this story is framed is insane...nbc do better
"The historical record is clear:  The Jewish People have lived in Jerusalem since King David purchased the threshing floor on Mount Moriah (now the Temple Mount) 3,000 years ago.<br><br>David told the owner of the land,<br><br>“‘Give me the site of the threshing floor that I may build on it an altar to the LORD—give it to me at its full price … I will not take for the LORD what is yours, nor offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing.’ So David paid Ornan 600 shekels of gold by weight for the site.”  (1 Chronicles <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6G6MWe6IQ&amp;t=21m22s"">21:22</a>–25)"
Israelis are terrorists. Only been in the land since 1948 and think the land is theirs?🤔
"I hope ppl can return safely <br>Im not blaming but I do have a question why do people visit places where there is an active war, when they can stay safely somewhere else? I mean like ppl who are citizens of other countries like the U.S."

"Netanyahu got what he wanted and attack on Israel now he can wipe out all Palestinians but at what cost.<br>How many Israelis have to die for Netanyahu‘s prophecy come to pass? My philosophy make love, not war."

I bet Lester holt had a war bon..er whilst reporting.
"I feel for the guy, but negotiating with hostage takers only encourages hostage taking. Isn&#39;t that why we generally frown on the idea, even if it&#39;s an awful choice to have to make?"
Ive seen alot of video&#39;s where israeli children were spitting at grown up christians carrying a cross anybody else seeing how Israeli people acts towards anybody else not israaeli but they are here in america  just all over the globe......hope GOD comes to help his chosen people not people that claim that are chosen......alot of lies being spread
Hamas is evil and Biden is responsible
NBC sharing real people increases the likelihood of their death.
So Israel wasn&#39;t prepared as many believed and Israel himself though he was.

I don&#39;t know Rick. It looks fake 😒
"Hamas terror vs Israeli terror? Israeli  IDF has killed thousands with impunity while the government starves the Palestinian  Israel provoked and the child reacted. Unexpected? Bibi’s secret goading, lighting the fuse."
He who throws the first stone is without sin
"I like how they kept calling Hamas &quot;terrorists&quot; but when Israeli terrorists do the same, they&#39;re innocent. Biased news."
Biden dont care. He will throw us all under the bus.
Poor innocent people are the only ones suffering on both sides. How much weight does the avg citizen have in the foreign affair’s of their government. <br><br> One human life  &gt;  Disputed Land
Thanks Europe for continuing to support the Palestinian people ✊🏼 I will be donating to humanitarian efforts for Palestine as well - CA 🇺🇸
"To anyone who think this is a conflict of land, read what “the religion of peace” says about the jews.. The hate is build into their religion, and nobody talks about it."
Many Americans have been killed…..<br><br>Shows foreigners…..<br><br>?????????????
This dude is just happy hes not in a suit reading his teleprompter
"Everyone knows IRAN is the bully behind all of this, they must be dealt with and in a harsh way..."
Hamas is pure Evil
NBC wouldn&#39;t share this if Biden hadn&#39;t made his statement of support.
Most Americans don&#39;t even want you Biden...🙄
"Yeah, tell me again I dont need an ar 15..    You are right I need multiple AR10s....."
Wouldn&#39;t be happening if Trump was POTUS
Why would the Biden administration help Americans in Israel? He funded this attack and gave the go-ahead to HAMAS. Our tax dollars are responsible for the deaths of innocent civilians from all over the world.
إذا دخل الروس واخذوا بيوت الاوكران تخيل ان يأخذ احد منزلك ماذا تفعل إسرائيل سرقت بيوت الناس فهل يشاهدك وانت تسرق منزله <br>لا عجب الغرب الرجعي العنصري وتاريخه اسود
Israeli state terrorism
When Ukraine defendeds its territory they are heroes when Palestinians do it they are terrorists and human animals. This is unbelievable
"Hamas stripped the women, inserted gun barrels into their genitals.Beheaded innocent children, burnt old people alive.They killed people from Nepal, Thailand, American, German and many other countries and called it Islamism.If this is Islam then it is really very dangerous.Every religion gives the message of love for the oppressed people.Fight the war with army but Hamas has turned this war on the wrong path by committing cruelty."
"Here’s the thing, hamas is a terrorist organization, and we accept that they will attack civilian targets. But Israel demonstrates terrorist behavior. This is not acceptable."
Israel is targeting anything that moves and civilian&#39;s buildings killing everybody in Gaza. They been doing the same and torturing Palestinians for 75 years now. They are the terrorists who been killing British soldiers and peace keepers 1946-1948. This is the result they caused and Muslims reacted at this point. Israel will loose as Allah is on Muslim side and there is nobody to protect them from what they deserved.
So sad for the innocent ones in this on both sides😢<br>I am not taking any side...peace to all from the USA.
Netanyahu is bombing Gaza so intensely that the hostages lives may end because of the bombing!
Universe please look out for our journalists too 🙏🏼 ✨️
"Are you a dual national ? because if you are I hate to tell you that US did nothing for their dual national citizens of Pakistan, while they are illegally captured and held in jail for months."
USA MUST CALL FOR A CEASEFIRE IMMED!
It was so powerful the way Biden read the teleprompter !!  I bet he got ice cream after! And I know the Israeli people feel better after it!
"Please  do better than showing us  little still photos on cards.<br><br>   The You Tube Shorts have a horrific video of  the Palistinian. Victims.,,. <br>     <br> Guy showed  still photos at the UN ."
PALESTINIEN hawe the right too Response  toooo
A son that actually loves his mother ....USA need to stop acting like nothing like this could ever happen here or even close...every dynasty falls at one point ☝🏽 just a matter of when and how 🤔 🙃
"Well, if we can believe that one of the most well-equipped intelligence services in the world didn&#39;t notice the prep work for this alleged attack, you got to keep in mind these people have been living in an open-air prison, a sort of concentration camp that is 5 mi by 25 mi in dimension known as the Gaza strip.<br><br>Many of the attackers would have been born into this apartheid setting and it is all they have ever known, and leaving the attack was the first time they&#39;ve ever seen any other part of the world.<br><br>Think about that...."

How hypocrite headline 😂😂😂😂
America gave 158 billion dollars to Israel this year by March 1!!!! You&#39;d think Israel would also give Zewlynsky $6 billion dollars instead of The United States!!!!
"My God, hearing from the families broke my heart. I pray their loved ones are found safe and returned home. To be on the phone or see videos online of your loved one being taken would be a complete nightmare."
praying for gazaa.isreal want this war
FOR ISRAEL AL GAZA IS HAMAS. DISGASTING.
America first !
More and more killing of innocent people. Why don’t these coward leaders get out and fight themselves
"The Palestinians rejoiced in the streets after the attack on Israel, the butchering of families, elderly, children and babies. The taking of hostages. They are not celebrating now."
maybe trump can make a phone call and end it......
A Eye for a eye theory sucks rite about now for many arabs over there<br>Good luck
Humans are violent apes<br>we always have been<br>lots of evolving to go
"I hate to say it but if the civilians that were murdered in Israel would have been allowed to be armed and carrying, there would have been a lot less of them dead or kidnapped, just shows how important it is to exercise our right to carry a firearm in the United States you never know what could happen. Get your concealed carry and get proficient at hitting your target fast"

Israel been terror attacking Palestine since 1948
"Biden take responsibility? Netanyahu, you take responsibility! You deny Two State Resolution!"
Jesus will save his people. He always has! He is the only God! The only true God. There’s nothing he cannot do.
Well if you CommieCRAT&#39;s weren&#39;t allowed to steal the 2020 election. This or Ukraine wouldn&#39;t be happening today. ULTRA MAGA TRUMP 2024
"And to think we gave anything to Iran is sickening forget what Obama gave them, the fact Biden just unfroze 6 billion dollars and they are using weapons he decided to leave in Afghanistan its terrible. 1 week after we did the swap and unfroze the money iran gave the go ahead for the attack they helped fund and plan."
MAY GOD BLESS EVERYONE IN ISRAEL GOD&#39;S PEOPLE ❤❤
"No civilian animals in Gaza deaths are worth reporting, nor the war crime of cutting off food and electricity 😶"
NBC U R PART OF THIS ATROSITY BUT LOOK AT U PRTENDING TO CARE
gaza is a concentration camp full of desperate people
"Terrorists? Umm, when your people are rounded up and thrown into a concentration camp (overdosing on irony here), with all passages in and out blocked, and no pipeline of extorted assistance ala north korea style, you will have no economic viability, and therefore, you will have to scrape up some rag tag vigilante army...wahlah...Hamas. Let&#39;s get that straight."
you are discusted by babies being killed there but it&#39;s ok here?????  You are insane
Where did this happen at?
"isreal is rascal,terrarist"
HOPE Israel WILL MOVE TO America
"Okay - so when a couple of days ago it was &quot;poor Israel,&quot; but now that Israel is doing WORSE to the civilians in Gaza/Palestine, it&#39;s fine. GENOCIDE!!!!!!!!!<br>ISRAEL is corrupt, steals land, beats old woman (I&#39;ll never forget those pictures decades ago - bulldozing Palestinian homes and pushing and fighting ELDERLY people.)<br>Sure, not &quot;all&quot; Israeli&#39;s support Nut-anyahu - but they hate. They hate Muslims. They even want the Catholics out. And America gives them MORE MONEY....<br>Be Jewish. Be Muslim. Be Christian. BUT STOP PRETENDING THAT ISRAEL IS THE VICTIM! If you don&#39;t like it, Israelis - then STOP IT."
Israel uses white phosphorus؟؟؟؟؟
The bully cot punch and it not fare.
There should be a two state solution to this madness.
Wow haven’t seen this many views on legacy media since the election cycle 🙄
Genocide
"Shame on you MSMBC, the victims of this conflict are the Palestinians, Mr Holt why don’t go to Gaza and see for your self the carnage and tge mayhem that terrorist Israeli army has done for the the Palestinians, go man and see for yourself."
Lol try seeing this 365 days a day for the last 70 years. Your house blowing at any times while having dinner with your family and suddenly they are all dead. Your 12 taken by force and put in jail and you haven’t seen him since a decade. Your people beaten and kicked out of their homes. Cowards with guns and you are not allowed to defend yourself if you fight they shoot you in and your family in the head. They cut the water and electricity constantly bombing your houses beachside you are fighting someone that colonized you and took your land and kills you and treats worse than they treat animals. Imagine when you finally fight back they call you a terrorist and then they are heroes.  Like Ukraine is because they defend themselves.. the irony of the hypocrisy.. hmm wonder why it’s you first time seeing this though it’s like it never shown to you in the media like your brainwashed me programed to know only what they tell you and how they program you to control you. Some of you are smart enough to know when they are being deceived yet you act like your don’t know anything.. shame on you!!
The US shouldn’t be involved.wasting our tax money on war when we can help our own US citizens fighting poverty.
"Let this be a good example of why we have a 2nd amendment. That dude that got executed behind his car hiding. That man WISHED. He had a gun!! An our country is trying to take that right away from us. THAT&#39;S WHY WE HAVE GUNS..  so when youre coos or military aint there to protect you , youre gun is thier to protect YOU , AND YOURE FAMILY. makes me absolutely sick seeing that , and even sicker knowing our &quot;&quot;&quot;leaders&quot;&quot;&quot; are to ignorant and stupid! To understand that."
"Seriously, nobody can blame them. Hamas fighters acted like animals."
"No one should be a hostage on any side. There are Palestinian children in Israeli prisons too, that’s also a form of kidnapping and holding a hostage. This cycle has to stop, if humans don’t want to stop it, nature will at some point."
Welcome to the human condition evil. Horrible how humanity treats each other.
I stand with isarail ❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏🙏
Here in New York we have cowardly racist politicians refusing to extend support for all innocent lives in this violence. The horror of terror victims and lives destroyed by collateral damage by deliberately heavy handed military reprisal both encompass innocent lives. Innocent Israelis and innocent Palestinians alike are victims of this cycle of violence. To deny anyone group due support and sympathy is at the heart of why the conflict will always be fueled and extend beyond generations.

"People crazy, u want the president to b responsible for loved ones safety instead of them bueng responsible for thier own n jus leaving"
Good look with Biden
Blood on Biden’s hands.   Funding terrorists.
Biden needs to send humanitarian aid to Palestine now that Israel has cut off their water.
Why don&#39;t you mention the crimes of the Israeli occupation over the centuries against Palestine that they are terrorists? Palestine
This is what happens when ppl r placed n a country n claim it as their own smh!!!
"Murder on top of murder is madness. War crimes by Hamas cannot be responded with more war crimes. Targeting Hamas positions? They intentionally targeted multiple Mosques and civilian buildings. Bombing the crossing to Egypt so no innocent civilians can escape. Half the population are children and they&#39;ve cut off water, power, food, and medicine. Horrors in response to horrors is not the answer. Over the past 20 years, Israel has killed over 10x more Palestinians. 750,000 &quot;settlers&quot; have stolen homes and land in the West Bank. Peace can not be achieved by more horrific dehumanizing of each other, especially all of these children."
Please protect the innocent on all sides 😭
This Is Fun I Left The State Fair Had A GREAT Time Ate Sum Good Food Now I&#39;m Layin Down Watchin War 😎 I Love Being A TURRRRRTLE AKA American.... 😭😭😭😭😭 Now I Know Why They Hate 🇺🇸 😅😅😅 Duck Yall 💣 Comin

Prayers with Israel
This hatred is disgusting
"Could this story not be told from behind the desk, in America? NBC apparently hates Lester more than I do."
"This is the story of the Scorpion and the Frog.  It is simply in their nature to commit atrocities.  There is no logic, there is no humanity, there is no feeling, there is only a beast that acts as beasts do.  And anyone who tries to make a deal something like that will ultimately end up attacked by it, so really there is only one way for humans to deal with these types of things."
Why even Americans doing in the country in the first place you know it’s not safe why do you go to China North Korea Russia Americans are not welcome to those country. Stay where you are free the most the US or Canada or the UK somewhere that are allies
America gov.doest care about it&#39;s citizens lol
You gotta remember Israel has done 10 times worse to palestine.
We should not be sticking our noses in these affairs
GOD please save the innocent and rid us of the wicked. God please help the innocent people. God please help the children. 😭
"Our useless president will do nothing to help, The hate to carry out such attacks is mind boggling. I guess the devil is running wild"
Yes she stole from the store. No she shouldn&#39;t have been shot for allegedly stealing liquor. Why stand in front of the car and risk getting run over? His life isn&#39;t worth dying for a bottle of liquor either

"Why, just why? A MAJOR majority want peace between the 2 and for all the killing of innocent people to stop. Yet the war wages. Truly evil people in control of our world"
Did u hear binden talk about Hamas or Iran never said a word i ly what the wrote for him discussing
Palestinians country map changed very much daily....I not support any violation
Does this means that the Ukraine war has come to an end??
I&#39;m considering getting a reverse osmosis water treatment system
Finally unbiased commentary!
. HEY NBC WHATS PAY FOR SLAY ???.   BY THE RICH IN AMERICA ??..?  BIDEN PAYING IRAN  SOUNDS LIKE EACTLY WHAT BID3N SAID ITS ABOVE HIS PAY GRADE !!   MONSTERS YOUR MASTERS ASWELL PULLING STRINGS ? Orchestrating PEOPLE AGAISNT PEOPLE !  ALL PEOPLE !
Biden voted to send us to Iraq. Lloyd Austin came off the board of raytheon to take his spot in this administration. Do not expect diplomacy with our current government. Just more war. This administration left 84$ billion dollars of weapons to the sunni wahabists extremists called the taliban in Afghanistan. As well as &quot;unfroze&quot; 7 billion dollars to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Expect more carnage. Buckle up
"Isfael brought this on themselves, what did they expect after treating their neighbors with attacks for many, many years?"
trump would have taken action over 1 american
It is as expected for a lineage of terrorist
This is not Biden’s fault no this is Israel’s fault for continuing to steal more of Palestine from the natives over there.<br>Israel you power hungry control freaks you’re done this time you problem nobody else’s problem so good luck and goodbye you’re on your way out of Palestine very soon you imposters FAKE JEWS from mother Russia. An ideology book is not proof that land is yours or anyone else’s except the native Palestinians country like it’s always been since the beginning of time
That war will go for a few months until Gaza is no more.
"America has your back , remember that as your back stabbed."

Trying to start another war... We get out of one and the military industrial complex wants to start another. Israel let them enter the southern border. A woman that was in IDF said they know if a bird crossed but they waited 8 hrs to do anything.
Are these the chosen people according to bible ? They&#39;re fighting all their life ! And killing each others.
"I dont see anybody in this war targeting hamas or israeli army. <br>I see targeting civilians. Depopulation agenda has begone? <br>When everything fails, they take you to war."
Flatten it
🥱
Close the border now
If Muslim defend they are country then white peoples call them terrorist what a joke
"Support all indian without muslim...... Israeli brother and sister 🇮🇳💓🇮🇱,"
"Blurring bodies doesn&#39;t help people understand the shock of real war and carnage. When the Draft comes back, today&#39;s generation will begin to grow up. Revenge that goes too far will bring more hate and bloodshed. One thing for sure. Palestinians will never have a claim to Jerusalem now. Hamas killed that."
the correspondent is a dud - one absolutely Dumb question after the next
"This is insanity. No innocent person should die, if you have something against the government then take it up with them."
"At the end of the day, both Hamas and the IDF have no reservations for civilian life<br><br>This cycle of hatred keeps both sides united, and props up support - Gaza will always suffer in their thousands, and this time, 1200 Israeli&#39;s too"
🙏🙏🙏😥😥😥🙏🙏🙏
Really driving home why hammas attacked them. MSNBC won&#39;t criticize you Israel but I will.
Well there are ten&#39;s of thousands maybe hundreds of thousand here in the U.S. because of open borders morons
"Oh… I have a feeling I see Ucraine and no Israel … the same picture… I pray for You, Israel 🇸🇻❤️🙏… and You Ucraine 🇺🇦❤️🙏"
Everyone happy with that 2020 vote ?
"Another insincere, maudlin reply from plastic Biden."
"You mean to tell me that the Jews didn&#39;t see this coming? Israel, with one of the most sophisticated missile defense system, let these guys parachute in and just invade them like this? No way. War brings money. Jews love money. What a joke."
"Not Hamas, Israel is terror, muslims never killed child or girl or old, but Israel killing a lot of child, women, old people during more years😡Inshaaloh Falastin win"
"The Ezekiel war is near. Watch and see how Russia is drawn out, like a fish with a hook."
Thats special. They are saying biden has the responsibility to find their us family members behinwere stupid enough to go to Israel who brutzlize the Palestinians.
Free 🇵🇸
Since win did biden care about killing babies? <br>God bless Israel and comfort the innocent victims!
Well now it’s a massive Israeli terror attack isn’t it?
Who cares focus on America. Those people should have stay here in the us
Just in time for USA prime time TV.
&quot;This is Israel&#39;s January 6th.&quot; - AOC
Biden  is responsible  .Didn&#39;t  his illegitimate regime  just give  Iran millions  ?

Biden can&#39;t save the Americans since Israel is carpet bombing them.
"They expect &quot;BIDEN&quot; to do something. Biden abandoned a bunch of Americans behind in Iraq and other nationalities, also left behind a massive stockpiled weapons for the terrorists. It may be a different group but you know they are selling those weapons to other terrorist groups.<br><br>At least Trump was killing the terrorist"
Potato Joe - Biden the Weak - the world is a wreck with a senile puppet as American president
biden = nukes
Who are the innocent civilians in this situation though? The Israeli Civilians who just want to live a peaceful life and defend themselves from any attack or the Gaza Civilians who knows they live with a terrorist group within their population and didn&#39;t do anything to suppress them? There are no civilians in Gaza. The people there are terrorist sympathizers. Gaza needs to be purified.
"pro Palestine Hamas, pro terrorist, this is their 9/11"
This is all intentional and all Biden and his cronies fault and most everyone knows it!  They funded it with the 6 billion they happily gave them to create more war. War war war… money money money. Chaos chaos chaos. Death death death! Suffering suffering suffering! They live for it all!👹
"Isreal was given back to the Jewish people by the UN after centuries of Jewish displacement after the Romans occupied the land. Its not Palestinian land and never will be. Peace to Israel, prayers and hope."
"While I am no fan of the DNC cheerleading NBC news, I am impressed that they sent their anchor to Isreal and he is interviewing ppl there.  For once they act like a real news organization."
And he looks for help from a nation that come up with the saying there&#39;s a sucker born every minute
"Lord help please YOU see what happening humans killing each other,  please stop it"
Joe biden does not have the balls he was born with.
Biden won&#39;t do anything. His track record says it all.

The environment has become smoky with fumes n dust and gases
Omg stop just stop
I consider this attack a suicide since gaza is about to be wiped off the map
How come there is still people walking the street? Are they dancing with the sound of Israel bomb?😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
"Israel is gross evil apartheid state, the USA supports and funds Apartheid, and supports it fully so as normal USA is Gross evil"
None of the Palestinians mothers ever say &quot;I wish our men would just stop trying to overthrow Israel. It&#39;s not worth the carnage. I would rather have my water and internet back instead of being bombed.&quot; They merely cry and that&#39;s as far as it ever goes.
World war three is getting closer and closer

It&#39;s sad to say there are no hostages they have been dead
This is going to be scorched earth. The Israelis are going to level Gaza and everyone in it.
"For years, the Palestinians have been killing children, women, and the elderly, and their lands have been usurped, and the world remains silent, and today they cry over the Zionists, the enemies of humanity."
Laying siege to Gaza is a WAR CRIME under IHL Rule 53.
War 😢😢
Prioritize bombing to the source of bombs
Horrible leadership in Isreal...horrible
They afraid cause we got threatened by them we lost our Americans to hamas enemies we need to get back they launched over 8 thousand missiles to overwhelm the israel dome defense system  when it could only hand about 200 to 400
This only happens with weak American leaders. Same with Ukraine.  Wake up people.
98% of usa couldn&#39;t even afford to drive or own a vehicle to even get to a party within view of an open-air PRISON so we can PARTY in front of them. ...... MOST of us Americans are too POOR to drive to the corner so .... Not interested ❤
"Yeah, we should definetly get into a nuclear conflict over this attack. yep"
I seem to recall a few people stating this was in the works a year or do ago. Not to mention Hamas being vocal about some kind of revenge. The US intel mentioned it a while back as well about rumblings occuring. So was this actually a sutprise or planned ignorence? Planned ignorance gives justified response to level Gaza.
Fake news. Yellow journalism. All are blind 😮. Don&#39;t know why this happened to gaza by Israel terrorist.
"Propaganda, you know, the current Psyops thang"
Hamas are demons.
beheading babies is disgusting. Leave no one alive Israel
"Down with All of Islamic terrorist in the world, specially Palestinian and other Savage Arabs"
"Your chilling images aren&#39;t very chilling. Perhaps it&#39;s just my eyes, but I can&#39;t see anything but a blur. I guess you think we&#39;re supposed to take your word for it."

"A hypocritical, double-standard, unfair media that falsifies the facts, makes the victim a criminal and makes the criminal a victim"
Let Israel take care of it. They will do what they can to free them
Deuteronomy 35: It is mine to avenge; I will repay. In due time their foot will slip;  Their day of disaster is near and their doom rushes upon them.”
Based on those footages Israel seems to be doing pretty good. <br>Stop using my money to support other countries.
"Oh Lord God, the protector of your children, I pray for peace, in the mighty name of Jesus. Amen"
If there is support for Palestine. Would there be peace?
Who kills the gazan’s in the streets? Answer: Hamas. They want them to stay and die in their buildings after Israel warns them to get out.
Hamas is going to get annihilated for this
Legacy media is disgusting!
I got dibs on Shanghai
i wish there was the same support for yemen
Gut wrenching! How Anyone cannot SEE how this administration has failed the security of Our Country Blows my mind! If my 14 yr grandson can put all the dots together to debate the obvious downfall Why can&#39;t You regonize and Report the Truth how This administration hasn&#39;t a clue how to Secure Our Country? God Help US! Appears to be a bit planned when We paid Billions of Our Money for hostages😢 Now the plan will be USA give out more money to continue to support Iran wake up America God Help Us😡
Let us not forget what is Israeli did to the black  Israelite people that  in Israel  .Know black person should be in support of the  Israeli . Israel belongs to the African American. and all of that region that they are fighting over.They are fighting over stolen land.
atleast no mean tweets
Israel will take care of business. Biden will be of no help to Americans in Israel. Biden is the president who left Americans behind in Afghanistan and he will leave Americans behind in Israel. It was Biden’s failing Middle East policies that financed Iran who financed Hamas.
Palestinians babies have been killed by Zionist for 75 years. All this could have been resolved years ago. But the persecuted became the persecutors.<br><br>Deir Yassin massacre
Poor guy believes Biden is competent to rescue his mom. 😢 Someone tell him the truth 🙏🙏🙏
"Lol, more media war machine propaganda for a war that has been going on since 1917... ukraine funding stopped, so gotta drum up another way of the globalists to make money of war.. rinse and repeat"
EU changed their mind and decided to give the Palestians the money. God will judge them.
Turn off your TV. This is just another psy-op.
Israel should level Palestine. Leave nothing standing.
Palestinian confirm child deaths 246 currently.  .against 40.  Seems skewed 🤔
Look at the propaganda headline...thank God social media is here
This is very terrible.
peace for jerusuelm☮🙏
"I really feel confident with Biden at the helm. This Administration has no idea of what it is doing. We need a Teddy Roosevelt, an Eisenhower or a Trump. With our politicians, we got the Keystone cops."
Hamas will get the response they deserve. Hamas knew their own people would suffer as result of their actions but they don&#39;t care. Seems like Gazans didn&#39;t care either because they voted Hamas into power.
🙄 Now its please lord help these people.<br>But when atrocities loke this hapoen to folks of color its just another day.<br>So i say &quot;OH WELL&quot;<br>I GOTTA GET SOME SKEEP FOR WORK TOMORROW 😴<br>GOOD NIGHT
It has come. The time of Palestinians in Israel is history. They cannot be trusted. Imagine living across the street from baby killing terrorists. Unimaginable.
Never  underestimate what is being done behind the scenes.   They don’t say because it is important to be silent.
"Why isnt Harris laughing, she is a joke"
Rich kid want a US evac?  Well let me pump up my share count😂
Why does the presenter look like he is holding back hysterical laughter?  NBC you are weird.
Sadly US is heading down this path unless we voters stop the (r)s from forcing both their unhinged fuhrer  and their tunnel-vision religious beliefs on this nation
The United States should not get involved no matter what
"Most people don&#39;t realize that Gaza strip is literally blockaded air, land, water by Egypt and Israel.  It&#39;s essentially a closed in prison.  Sad extremism on both sides will cause the innocent to suffer."
Hamas is Barbaric Terrorists Jordan People No Palestinian All of Them are Jordanian Remember this
So… why is the terrorist murder of a thousand Israelis rightly considered a tragedy but Israel bombing 900 Palestinian civilians considered a success?
Sending prayers to Israel.  THE USA STANDS WITH ISRAEL.
Ever going to mention the weapons Hamas is using are the ones we left in Afghanistan  or is that not important?
God rain down his wrath and judgement on Hamas!!!!
"The current Israeli government needs to target only Hamas, the terrorists groups responsible, not the innocent of Palestine. To do so is to become like the terrorists. To  do so is to become a terrorist government."
Don’t worrie give them another 6 billion dollars u idiots every single death is in Biden hand for giving Iran 6 billions so they can fund hamas to do this idiots
He helped Iran booo Biden
All for RELIGION  AND  a place of LAND.  We are HUMANS  shouldn&#39;t we just want simple things....humans to be good to humans.❤
Come on America start using your planes. I dont trust Biden ot Obama.
No to 2 state solution. The evil sheltered in these Palestinians shows the fears of Israelis are a living phantom.  The time is not ripe. The Iran threat is real. The evil cartel must be brought to its knees. Its clear we have a disillusioned people in power which has lost all sweet taste for life.
Biden didn’t help those in Afghanistan. What makes you think he’ll help the Americans there?
আমেরিকা জালিম ইসরাইলকে সহযোগিতা করছে নিরীহ ফিলিস্তিনিদের বদদোয়া আর কান্নার কারণে একদিন ভেঙে পড়বে জালিমদের ক্ষমতার সিংহাসন
Prayers for those children who died.   There’s no right or wrong.
This is not our business we already helping Ukraine for what reason?
Giving Iran 6 billion dollars is NOT having Israel&#39;s back!
"Hamas are basically just like ISIS, freakin animals."
"Would hope that every American being held hostage would say, &quot;Flatten this place!!!&quot;  Scorched earth and end the stupid hostage-taking..."
International community should come forward to stop war and restore peace. Two nations theory is the solution for peace. War is not.
Hamas needs to be removed from the Ghaza Strip. They are no friend of the Palestinian people there.
"Place rocket launchers next to civilian buildings, use civilian buildings as command and control, expect civilian casualties."
"State Department officials in 2021 outlined the concerns in private communications, asking the Treasury Department to exempt them from laws that bar the U.S. government from injecting taxpayer aid into territories controlled by Palestinian terror groups. The Biden administration needed this authorization in order to move forward with its plans to unfreeze more than $360 million in U.S. funds for the Palestinian Authority that were cut off during the Trump administration due to the authority&#39;s support for terrorists.   huh...go figure"
"What do they expect Biden to do? Negotiate with terrorist😂. Hypothetically Let’s say Biden did get the hostages back, but with some concessions made to Hamas. People would go crazy especially Israelis. These hostages are never getting release an Israel knows that too.They are not going to negotiate with Hamas. They are going to let them die. An the level the Gaza Strip. Jews will rejoice and accept that there love ones did not die in vain."
Hamas needs to go one way or the other
"They are not retaliating, they are defending themselves. Muslims….they have not changed in 1400 years!"
I wish Trump was President
How come Israel do not recognize a black man a historical person from that land and yes I feel sorry for what these people are going through but they should not be there just like these Americans who took the Indian Land right here in America
"I feel like Russia is some how behind this plan overall or at least gave the green light for it to happen. It would make sense, I feel that Russia is trying to run the United States thin by having us support all these other countries, if China decides to financially back Russia later down the road after the United States hands over billions of dollars to support the new Israel war, &amp; ultimately China becomes the worlds new super power smh. Wake up"
Biden is a coward
free palestine 🇵🇸
Truly horrifying to see both sides resorting to terrorist attacks on residential targets :/
Biden is a disgrace.
"Annihilation is inevitable, and after Gaza is turned into glass, they will have to rename it as &#39;The glass remnants of Gaza&#39;..."
Those Americans are dead. Let be real
Thanks for calling them what they are: terrorists.
is there a difference between killing a baby with a gun and killing one with a bomb? .... no....
Israel is not retailiating they declared  war you monkey 🐒
Let pray 🙏😇 ask God for some solution of  the conflict with lsrealites and Palestinians.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6G6MWe6IQ&amp;t=3m33s"">3:33</a> Not that I disagree with him but he shouldn&#39;t call them &quot;animals&quot; on live TV, they may use that to retaliate against his mother."
I don&#39;t know what to believe with all the fake news the media puts out. <br>Unless we see it for ourselves what can be believed with such a corrupt fraudulent government in office.
I can&#39;t imagine the pain and suffering the hostages are going through right now and I&#39;m sure most of them have already been executed 😢
This is what lefties don’t understand every citizen of any country should have the right to to bear arms and protect themselves this would never happened here in the us  without serious gunfire from citizens
"Ya, Biden sounds big and bad😂😂😂😂😂"
Freedom for Palestine 🇵🇸
Why does Lester always looks so happy when kids are dying around him?
Explain why Americans are in countries known for its dangerous atmosphere and war?
The Jews are the real terrorist. For years they have killed the Palestinian people and played the victim to the media. It’s time for a change.
THE EEUU PRESIDENT IS ALWAYS LOST AND WEAK
The Palestinians allowing Hamas to live and operate in Gaza earned this. You cant allow evil to co exist and not expect problems. Vote and erradicate your problems.
NBC gets a free pass to post graphic images of war crimes? Isn&#39;t that against YouTube tos?
"Joe made a bad deal with Iran, and that money was used to fund this. Nice job, Stinky!"
"Thanks to media like abc, Biden will pay billions to get them back! That’s why they took them!"
Praying for the safe return of the hostages.
"IT is time for the Palestinians to get rid of Hamas, then their lives might get better, and peace might finally come to the land"
"seriously, lester, ellison and all nbc staff and crew: you guys and gals have balls of steel to risk your lives to bring us the news. pray that all of you return home safely and that this conflict/war ends as soon as possible <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>"
MY PPOPLE HAVE SUFFERED ENOUGH FROM THESE BARBARIANS. ALL OF MY ANCESTORS DIED IN THE HOLOCAUST. GOD BLESS ISRAEL!!!
Send them to their virgins
holy crap. is this the first thing every American can agree on?
stay strong Israel &lt;3
Turn Gaza into a pile of useless rubble!!
"Next Billions fight each other for nothing WW3, Greed 😢 week humans week world leaders."
During WW2 the world chose to end evil only for it to return and thrive even worse than before because our leaders fail us again and again. When will it end?
😢🙏🙏🙏🙏
U WANT BIDEN TO DO....WAT ???
I hope Israel doesn&#39;t miss the opportunity to rid the world of this cancer
The Religion of Death
Why the Ritz Carlton Ad on the back ?
Biden is still sending aid to Hamas.
"So, does allahu akbar mean cutting the heads off infants?"
Level the place
Hamas will pay dearly
Requesting that Biden do something is very problematic.<br>His track record is poor...unless there&#39;s money involved.
DON&quot;T WORRY JOE BIDEN IS SO SUPER INTILLIGENT AND A REAL COOL guy HE WILL SEND Israel and Palestine $20Trillion dollars each. Because it&#39;s necessary to stop Climate Change by ending the COVID 19 pandemic by giving The pharmaceutical companies power to mandate lockdowns until we all have the same amount of money and socialism is achieved.
They are not terorroist freedom fighters. They free their victims of their heads. They must go
"I&#39;ve been saying, one way or another we will have troops on the ground in a war somewhere going into the 2024 election."
"You must use wisdom, this will take time. You can&#39;t expect Americans to run into a war zone with no strategy. That&#39;s foolishness"
No words
What about the half American journalist
😔🙏🙏🙏🙏
"I&#39;ve seen ERIN BURNETT ON CNN COVERING THE NEWS IN TEL AVIV,SHE LOOKS VERY SAD AND TIRED,HOPE ALLOUR JOURNALIST COME BACK HOME SAFE.GET SOME SLEEP MISS BURNETT."
Keep voting for the Democrat party. We see how well it’s working out for you.
Hamas must completely fall so they can never attack again
Israel retaliates after Palestine retaliates after Israel retaliates after…..
"Lester, you ready to blame Biden or will you still cover for him?"
"The funny part, after the hostages are rescued and safe, is that those insects called Iran back Hamas who are scared to fight against solders, are actually going to have to fight those who they are clearly very scared to fight against or scatter and run like a cockroach out-of-Gaza, because Hamas will no longer exist in Gaza is the Isreal principle purpose at war at present...listen to the words of the Israeli president on news videos.  Hama no longer will exist...they blew it by acting as cowards."
I don&#39;t understand why they using hostages that they already killed to trick Israel. I&#39;m sure Israel knows the majority of them are killed
"The United Nations declared 2022  the deadliest year  for Palestinians in the occupied West Bankk since 2006, evidence of increased use of force by Israel, amid a further shift to the far right in the country.<br>The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has previously noted that Israeli forces &quot;often use firearms against Palestinians on mere suspicion or as a precautionary measure, in violation of international standards”.<br>Isreal has been repeatedly accused of inacting an Islamic apartheid and ethnic genocide of Palestinians. <br><br>Why no support for the thousands of innocent Palestinians murdered by Isreal of the past years?"
Why blur images  Show the truth
"You may also make your report from Gaza Strip, what a puppet"
Hamas will never let the hostages out alive  They are just playing for time. Flatten Gaza.
Blurring license plates while someone gets executed??? Be careful where you get your news from
Same thing can happen here the southern border people just pouring on over
Well to be honest I don’t like what I see but the thing is why all this media and news n newspapers don’t speak when Palestinians getting tortured every day women kids  elderly list goes on  shame on Iran shame
Hamas stupid or crazy?<br>Don&#39;t they know consequences must be paid in 10 folds?
Praying for everyone affected 🙏🏻
False Flag Attacks..<br>Operation Northwoods Tactics
I’m sure the American families that lost loved ones in Israel can expect a $700 check from the White House soon
"Hypocrisy on the top of hypocrisy... When Israel is taking innocent lives no one comes forward to tag it as a terrorist attack, Double standards lost the empathy in people for such statements."
Israel doesn’t need our military troops. They have the hardware. They have an army of the willing. Just do what needs to be done and they pieces will have to be picked up. I feel for the hostages and the dead but it’s time to put this endless squabble to bed so the future can be free of terror for all involved.
Biden needs to be on both sides.   The Palestine people have been slaughter here since 1917.   Do your homework biden before you pick sides.    <br>  Nobody condons any ofvthe murders on bith sides.    Rip to all those that have died and best wishes for recovery of all that have been injured and displaced 🙏
Lester Lester
It&#39;s terrible what happened but the million children in Gaza shouldn&#39;t be victimized for it
"So we are all just pretending that Israel hasn’t been the aggressor here for a very long time?  Hamas is retaliating for cruel crimes committed against them time and time again by Israel.  Killing civilians on hostages is a horrible act by hamas. But let’s not pretend it’s entirely unprovoked.  The US supporting Ukraine through a hostile take over by Russia, while supporting the aggressor of a hostile  occupation by Israel is ironic.   Horrible that innocent people on both sides are suffering over this nonsense."
70 years of brutal occupation must end.  No Justice no peace.
JB needs to be put in PRISON for WAR CRIMES. HE caused this
O<br>M
"Palestinians that are here in the U.S. are saying Israel is a tool of the United States. Their audacity to say such things and their bigotry. These people walk hand in hand with Hamas and should not be here living in the United States. They have thick faces. If you don’t like the idea that the United States are against terrorism, you are welcome to leave and don’t be like leeches sucking on what America has to offer."
"AMAZING how EVERYTIME for the last 50 years when these attacks happen to Israel, the media makes it seem like the Palestinians attack out the blue for absolutely NO reason???"
"Hard to leave Gaza for safety when bridges and routes are closed. Hard to save the gravely wounded innocents without electricity and basic goods. Neither side is innocent , but we all know what happens when people are oppressed.  No winners.  Only heartache."
"well, you wouldnt be on youtubes news service comment section if you were extrapolating some sort of unconventional culpability for accountability, unless. still you wouldnt automatically engage conventional complaints just because they might happen to align with a sect of opinions, even if ignorant, or illegal. you could definitely isolate certain components for confrontation, if that was a directive."
Will YOU answer the call
level gaza get it over with
"Hey NBC, what effect does giving Iran Billions of dollars to be used for humanitarian purposes have on their disposable cash?  I was thinking, if they get billions for diapers and formula, that would free up cash that otherwise would be going to that for other purposes. Scary though, with Biden getting Iran back to the 5-year moratorium on Nuke development,  I think they probably didn&#39;t abide by that anyway and likely have a nuke.   Perhaps this is the beginning stages of their plan to wipe Israel from the face of the earth.  How about some investigative work on these subjects."
Anything Biden does will make things worse.  He is a fool and those who are running him are the same.  A bunch of globalist&#39; clowns.
"Biden provided Iran with the funding, why doesn&#39;t Biden provide funding to rescue Americans?"
Seems kind of arbitrary to refer to dual-citizens as &quot;Americans&quot;.
It’s judgment day!
Biden is to blame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Trump needs to step in!!!!!!!!!
"there is no excuse for what hamas did, and there is no excuse for bombing civilians discrimenatly! 2 state peace solution STOP before it spirals out of control. the international community is a complete failure, and so is the IDF that allowed this to happen and jeopardized innocent lives in the south from a couple hundred terrorist goons."
Are the people still celebrating with their insane quote &quot;Ullaa Hu Akbraaa&quot; ?
This never would have happened if Trump was our president. The evil in the world runs loose because there&#39;s no strong leadership.
"The mistreatment of millions, a lack of basic human services, no clean water, mass starvation, living in a open air prison, 57% unemployment,  what hope do they have?  . Those ppl are desperate, their children are dying a slow death of starvation, they have no other option. Maybe if simple human dignity was shown to them, they wouldn&#39;t act like wounded animals. once Hamas is obliterated, it will be open season on the Palestinians, the Israeli army is unmatched in the middle east and those soldiers will be out for blood. There is no winner here only death and despair😢...GOD bless all the INNOCENT souls lost on both sides. Im pray for peace love and dignity for every human being out there."
Crazy that people think we go to war on demand because your loved ones are in a hostile foreign country.  That’s the risk you take visiting these places.

I want to feel bad for all parties involved however Arabs make it very hard to care I&#39;ve felt the hate they pajet for anyone who is not of their race. May El Shaddai protect his chosen people. as a Christian it is my duty to pray and do what I can for the Israelites.
"For dinner i had a 24 once Porterhouse steak, garlic mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli and two Artisan rolls. Desert homemade Apple pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was absolutely fantastic 👍🏻"
This is Bible prophecy coming alive once again...
One sided news as usual.
I would rather be bombed by my own bombs then be tortured. I figure that’s what all 150 or more are thinking.
How about we worry about our own country and drop the gas prices
Get rid of this Biden administration and stop protecting him.. he has played a large part in zHamas&#39; terrorism!!  Do not hand  Iran a penny ever again!!
Two state is the simplest peaceful solution to this grave problem but occupier n oppressor Israel with his terror supporter US are supporters of  war not peace.
WW2 Part 2
"Biden sickens me. The weakest, most incompetent  President the U.S. has even put in office. Biden is a disgrace"
"The Biden regime has been busy persecuting Americans ... they didn&#39;t have time to keep up with terrorist intel ... because to Biden and his ilk their fellow Americans were the threat. What a shameful time in history for the disgusting, totalitarian Biden regime."
Im not an NBC follower but i say good job on this fair coverage of the war👍🇺🇸
"The UN shouldn&#39;t let this happen.  Why they let that Humus grow this big, they should stop them earlier.  Now, the situation is out of control, and many innocent people have to die.  I don&#39;t understand the humus leaders strategy.  They have no chance against Israel, and with this action, they lost the chance to solve the situation in a peaceful way. They don&#39;t deserve to get human rights. They  showed with the rest of the world what they did, so they deserve the same fate."
He caused this
Nobody told any Americans to be in Israel at the time of the attack. Why make demands of Biden? 😡
"Why,would Biden take responsibility for finding American citizens held captive when he&#39;s sleeping with Iran."
It’s your fault joe! You showed weakness when you needed to show strength
Biden was upset about the killed babies only because he didn’t get to sniff them!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Its pretty funny that Biden was forced to read the eroom and realize public opinion does not support Hamas or Palestine.   Now he, as a person who has many anti Israel staff members,  is going to have to flip flop and now support Israel because of public opinion."
Trump would have had them out
we going to be seeing bombarding the schools and hospitals and dying innocent palestinian children. World going to be crying crocodile tears and Israel is going to make their territory bigger. Kicking Palestinians out of their own land what happened to two-state solution who stop that
"Remember, if Gaza was so great NBC news would broadcast from GAZA not TELAVIV. Use your context clues people."
Massive terror attack done by Israel
Get the Americans out of there get the American hostages and leave this place. We dont belong there.
"My own feelings aside, and ignoring any media bias in actual reporting.  I applaud NBC for having the courage at least to leave their comments open.    Most other media agencies seem more interesting in sticking their head in the sand on the topic.  Good Job NBC."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6G6MWe6IQ&amp;t=0m24s"">0:24</a> &quot;Demanding Biden take responsibility for finding and securing the freedom of their loved ones&quot;.  Not a fan of Biden but why does he have to take responsibility for what happened in Israel?  They&#39;re the ones who chose to go to a country in conflict with another. You can ask for help but you should not demand.  And these citizens most likely also have Israeli nationality so if he should make demands, he should make them to Israel."
"Religious wars are the worst. They dont see combatants and non, they just see stains to their belief systems, its disgusting"
Pray for Palestine army to fight terrorist israel..
"INTENSIFIES???? Israel does not want war. Hamas wants to push Israel into the sea. Israel is DEFENDING its people against savage, UNPROVOKED brutality. BE RESPONSIBLE in your reporting!!!"
It&#39;s sounds harsh but would you rather the hostage be tortured or 1 big bomb an they are gone in a blink...if I had to choose how to go i know what I would pick
I have 0 faith in biden &amp; his admin. We need TRUMP back in office Asap.
Prayers for Gaza
Lord Jesus be with them.
"and democrats think we should give up our guns , thats what the isrealies did to their people , thats what ukrain did to its people , we the people wont do the same"
And the people they used airstrike is a terrorist
&quot;Hamas isn&#39;t targeting civilians&quot;<br>There&#39;s people who believe that. There&#39;s people in America who support them or believe their attack was justified. Think about that.
I am sorry to say that but<br>No one cares about there citizens like israel not even  the united state of amarica
Netanyahu using this to push for judicial reforms and deflect from his crimes
Anyone cheering in the streets for this absolutely evil act needs to be deported. And they said Diversity would be good.  Europe and America is infested with these demons and they&#39;ll retaliate soon against us.
THERE ARE DEMOCRATS who support the animals.
We need peace
76 years
"I just got back from Jabalia Israel  two days ago, and there wasn’t any bombing going on nor talks of any war. My coworker is still there and still no sign of any war taking place. Something isn’t adding up"
Marines .period.
What i need to know there is no way to capture  them without  war.
PEACE PEACE 😢😢😢FOR INNOCENT VICTIMS FOR BOTH SIDE WAR IS NEVER A ANSWER PEACE TO EVERYONE   praying God for everyone safety 🙏
"Pure Israeli propaganda. Americans! Realize this is a settler colonial occupier (Israel) who has been killing Palestinians, stealing their land, restricting their movement and resources for 75 years. People keep focusing on Hamas&#39; attack. But even if we who support thr Palestinians condemn Hamas&#39; attack, no one will cry over our children, women and men. Don&#39;t trust MSM. They are the ones whoade you think going to Iraq and Afghanistan was a good thing. War is not good for Americans. Don&#39;t get duped. Learn what really is happening by knowing what has happened. And I&#39;m still waiting for Israelis to condemn Israel&#39;s attacks on MSM but instead they are all calling Palestinians animals. The level of dehumanization is horrific. History anf God Himself will not judge kindly those who ally and sympathize with the forces of oppression."
Palestinians expect sympathy from the world after what Hamas did? GTFOOH.
Intensifies murder of 2.2 million Palestinians?<br><br>Shame on media for being mouth piece of genocide by Israel IDF
"Israel should turn Palestine into a parking lot, 10 feet deep!!  ONCE AND FOR ALL!  And it’s coming!"
retaliation my foot. israel is using hamas attack as an excuse to commit mass genocide in gaza.
"Islam is a religion of peace, yea, ok."
"Pourquoi l’Amérique soutient-elle l’Ukraine contre la Russie pour défendre ses terres, et d’un autre côté, se tient-elle aux côtés d’Israël dans son occupation des terres de Palestine ? Est-ce logique ou s’agit-il d’une politique de persécution des musulmans ? Il n’y a pas de justice dans la politique américaine ou les droits de l&#39;homme. Il y a plutôt une politique de la jungle. Le fort mange le faible, mais Dieu merci, cela Le monde est mortel. Chaque être humain dans ce monde a droit à la vie. Où est l&#39;organisation pour les enfants et les femmes &quot; Où est la justice dans l&#39;intervention américaine avec ses navires et ses armes pour soutenir Israël et empêcher tous ceux qui veulent intervenir pour protéger la Palestine ? Où est la justice et la prétendue humanité dans le siège de la Palestine ? Pourquoi les Israéliens ont-ils droit à la vie et les Palestiniens ne méritent-ils pas de vivre ?❤🇩🇿🇩🇿🇵🇸🇵🇸"
Report seems one-sided
Just because she&#39;s an American what you think you watch too much 🎥🍿 these things are delicate.
"If only NBC had covered the crimes for the past 10 years too… but Lester is there now, with US army…we will get the truth soon…lol"
What&#39;s the difference between terrorism and retaliation 🤔
"joe biden gave iran six billion dollars and iran funded hesballa who funded hamas to do this ,biden always lying"
Biden doesn&#39;t care he&#39;s with Iran
"Take notes kids, don&#39;t play nice with terrorists or liberals"
The self loathing felt by the people that cheered Hamas when they realize they cheered for the beheading of infants.  We&#39;re going to need a lot of suicide hotline operators on their game.
"There is something very very dark here. It makes sense that there appears to be a Monatizing for land grabbing instead of really trying to help these people. The whole situation is shady, and like the government is not only covering, but in on it. That makes it really hard to get a true envestagation out. That wouldn&#39;t have happened under the Trump Addminstration. I&#39;m thankful for the heroes that are fighting to get the truth out about the situation.😢"
Biden and the democrats financed this. Billions given to Iran. Wake up people. Your government hates you.
"To think, we had politicians in the streets supporting this attack from Hamas."
"How tf do they know if it Hamas is in the building. They destroyed a mosque, refugee camps, and actual residential buildings. The Israelis actually killed a couple of Hamas, 4 Israelis, and the rest were civilians. They think were stupid or something."
No one is innocent in war
I hate to say it but I don&#39;t think Gaza is going to exist after this. Israel destroy it and take the land back. Maybe that&#39;s a good thing. Then again there will thousands of casualties. Collateral damage
"Yes, Isreal is killing thousands of civilians. Great solution...."
"Behold I come quickly, as it is written. Only I can defeat Drizzle."
"The Marines in intelligence are aboard the USS Gerald R Ford (due to be off the coast of Gaza in about a day now) with all of it&#39;s different intelligence gathering jet planes, gear and 26 million dollars, each, drones, that can see deep underground,  through several roofs, ceilings and walls to located where all the over 100 hostages are located at in Gaza, hand it over to, and work with, the SEAL Teams(14 Teams) to rescue and save the lives of people from all around the world in Gaza.  This today is the works of 42 years in putting all together of former President Reagan words in 1981, at the ending of the Iran Hostage Crisis,  ordering for a team specifically trained and equipped to go into foreign countries in rescuing Americans taken hostage.  Sit back and watch the show after their completed intelligence gathering in Gaza, once these intelligence Marines arrive there(their the one&#39;s in the Veterans Day Parade who are driving all those Corvettes in the Veterans Day Parade in downtown Fort Worth, Texas, Sunday Dance Square.  They are really superhero US Marines...if only you knew what they do around the world for decades (you got to have a photographic memory to be in this division).  Do worry, the hostages will be safe and sound soon....the US/USA is part of Bible prophecy where after God stopped Abraham from sacrificing his son, God blessed Abraham in promised his offspring will one day be looked upon be the world for their needs.  Now, you know the rest of the story. <br>USMC"
Why would Israel not retaliate . They are a terrorize group. Hope all the brave u.s journalist stay safe.
"Never trust a moslem, islam is a religion of hate"
See how the media works America stop funding Ukrainian and Russian war so they switched their attention to a newer war don’t even talk about Ukraine anymore 😢
Free all hostages!! Now !!!
75 years after WWII and the Jews are still fighting for their right to exist.  One would think every Israeli would be armed and trained.  This fight won&#39;t be over for a very long time.
"There is only one side right and one wrong it&#39;s easy to know, you decide."
religion of peace strikes again
"God such hypocrisy you’ve sat on you’re hands and done nothing about 25yrs of apartheid and sickening human rights violations against the Palestinians, such selective morals must be so convenient"
They came in like Red Dawn . Makes you ask why Russia and China are flooding in troops in Mexico
"Wow, so happy lester went to Israel. How else could we know what is happening"
Religion = war
No one said anything when Palestine were getting killed by Israel. President Biden said children are killed in Israel. But Israel has been killing innocent children for years in Palestine. This is heartbreaking to see praying for the innocent people.
Hamas sera no mas! Y jamás atacara ! 🇮🇱
Lastly all of my enemies are direct enemies of God. Even during the hour of the power of darkness.
"Black &amp; White<br><i>_______</i><br>It is easy for us to be saddened by the destruction of a beautiful home.  Where there are happy children in it.  But it is difficult for us to empathize with the shacks that were flattened by bolduzers and bombs.  Where there are children living in poverty. <br><br>It is easy for us to give to cute and clean children who cry and whine for all their desires.  But it is very difficult for us to give even just a piece of bread to a child who is wearing shabby and dirty clothes on the side of the road or in a shelter.  <br><br>It is easy for us to empathize when we see a white, clean and well-dressed child when he is crying and scared.  But it is difficult for us to care about seeing a child with black skin and shabby clothes who has lived in terror since his birth.  <br><br>It is easy for us to feel concerned about healthy and cute children who are being treated by evil adults.  But it is difficult for us to grieve for a child who looks thin and ugly who has been afraid since birth.  <br><br>It is easy for us to curse and hate the murderers who took the lives of every child who previously lived a normal and joyful life.  But it is difficult for us to cry over the tragic deaths of poor children who have lived hungry, malnourished since childhood, had no place to play and then had to die from being shot in the head &amp; buried in concrete rubble.  <br><br>Throughout the world, everyone claims to be religious and writes down their religious identity on a piece of paper.

this is what happens when you hate your enemy more than you love your own people.
Crooked Biden can&#39;t ever take responsibility for the Amerikkans taxpayer&#39;s. So how can he support Israeli with ours Amerikkans taxpayer&#39;s? We need ours money to support ourselves. 💸 💵 🤔
We all agree
"It’s war , its military action against an enemy combatant who wish to slaughter its civilians, this is what they wanted,hail to the god of violence and his followers the achieved their goal precious war"
Funny how they complain about the so called blockade yet Egypt is totally complicit but it’s always the bad Israelis. But listen if you can get rockets and weapons you can also get food into the country. Hamas has shown the world the type of animals they are and now they were be dealt with. Also remember they celebrated in Gaza. They are all animals and are getting what they deserve
"If the US military go against Hamas, guess what?"
........NBC ....LIARS ... BIDEN NEVER MENTIONED IRAN
They&#39;re both killing people. Innocent people. Both sides are at fault.
"Israel is the terrorists , they stole their lands."
Joe Biden finance this war. He gave Iran 6 billion dollars and lifted sanctions on oil which gave them another 60 billion dollars to terrorize the globe.
"So... Now explain something to me. It&#39;s a terrorist attack for the Palestinians to attack civilians... Okay, I agree. So, why wasn&#39;t it a terrorist attack when say, the Russians attacked civilians..? Or the Israelis?"
Biden is the Guilty one
What a way to kick off Grabbler football season
Hamas =isis
We need to get th satellites off of our children and prevent the reactors and or accelerators from harming life. Agreed!
"I&#39;m outside,"
Those in USA that despite the terror perpetrated by the Hamas in Israel still support Palestinians deserved being blotted out as well
My heart goes to people of Gaza. Occupation must end.
Death to Allah
NBC news is lousy
May our powers combine I am Captain Planet
Is that Palestine or east Detroit ? 🙄<br><br>Shut the front door USA<br>Don&#39;t let em come in here <br>Look what they&#39;ve done to our beautiful America
Where are US commandos? Go in and rescue US citizens
"The peoples in this part of the world have been fighting each other for literally thousands of years.   At the root of it all is religion.  Because of that, it will never stop. And as the climate changes, and it gets too hot for people to live there, as water becomes scarce, it will only get worse."
According to prophecy? If the nations do refuse to serve me as King? God sends one trillion nuclear asteroids. Everything burns up and flees away. Then suddenly he&#39;ll make all things new. If I were any I&#39;d bet on black persay and not red. I&#39;d place all bets on Drizzle. Ah according to my perfect calculation? Not Hot 97 but 96.7 perfect able body adult population will believe on me Drizzle as world King. Yes only look at me as a human being visitor visiting. Worldwide public announcement. Mankind&#39;s intersection I&#39;ll set my glorious feet. As King. By all means don&#39;t allow the negroe face to fool you.
👀 / 👁️
Fkjbkam you.
Thank you for exceptional coverage and keeping us posted. My prayers go for all innocent bystanders on both sides. 🙏 ❤
"And when you start to see these things comes to pass, look up your redemption draweth nigh ."
Propaganda MSM didnt ask how many rockets six billion dollars in American tax dollars paid for
So strange you never give Palestine this same treatment when Israel does the same to them on an almost daily basis
"In the past ten years I have seen many persons under control it these satellites and reactors including many children, very movement breathing walking thinking, we do not yav many options,"
"Israel is an invader and Israel is the cruelest terrorist in the world. The UN and human rights do not apply to Israeli atrocities. Open your eyes and ears, look at the history of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict."
So many innocent lives lost ver War. Sad
What r u doing over there when any place can b hit ?
Need to have proof of life before anything happens. How this works.
"US news are super propaganda.<br>If you see any neutral country news, it won&#39;t be like this one-side evil story.😅"
When will they report the lives Israel has taken for the last THREE YEARS on a DAILY basis. Follow the money people.
NBC thumb down YOU DONOT REPORT THE TRUTH
Biden is so friggen embarrassing smh. Vote for Trump 2024. Make America great again.
"So Israel kills countless innocent Palestinians daily and when they fight back, they are considered the aggressors? The media is the strongest tool on earth."
And WW3 begins
Hey news go talk to the Palestinians that have been dealing with this for years!
"Biden “Israel, we have your back” also Biden “hey Iran, here’s 6,000,000,000$!”🤦🏼‍♂️ isn’t funding terrorist terrorism? Asking for a friend"
Trump and kids run too Ireland
"Israel can&#39;t negotiate.  There is no one to negotiate with.  If Hamas starts killing hostages like they said they would, that&#39;s on them not Israel.  God bless Israel."
May the helpless be comforted in Jesus name
Israel is the main problem
"It&#39;s 2,000 in Israel you liars! Democrats want war to pass their pockets! Now I see the EVIL the Dems are and always has been. The Lord is going to serve Hemas Justice with the tool they went after God&#39;s Chosen People"
You would think the most advanced and wealthier and smartest one would of had come up with a solution by now instead of killing them for 50 years
Какой бы ни был план США и израиль (террористическая страна) на территории Палестины - у Аллаха свои планы насчёт Палестины! Аллах скоро уничтожить США и израиль!!! <br>Об этом предупреждали даже еврейские предсказательи настродамус и другие...
Who had the authority to turn off the iron dome?
Seeing the execution of an unarmed person at point blank range say to me that Israel and the US should eliminate Hamas to the last person. And at any cost if even one hostage is executed.  This reign of terror by Hamas for so many years must be ended.
Biden want do anything he doesn&#39;t care about Americans
Whats the solution for this on going old mans war?
"Yeah, blame Israel to distract from Sleazy Joe Biden funding Hamas via Iran. Fake news circling the wagons for the DNC. 🤬"
"This is so sad. Reminds me of my childhood days when my country Serbia was illegally bombed 1999 by NATO. Thanks to Bill Clinton,Joe Biden, Madeline Olbright…"
Level Gaza and sell it to Oprah!
Dual citizenship is not a American. <br>Period
Justin Trudeau will envoke the WAR ACTS MEASURE because of this war.<br>He will freeze everyones bank accounts and seize all their assets.
So sad seeing so many Palestinian killed by terrorist Israeli army
&quot;Saving Israel for last&quot;<br><br>Q
It’s sad but those people are in a no win situation
You better read Holy scripture with animals you&#39;re talkin about yeah and Holy Scripture animals.!!!
It&#39;s not our war.
It&#39;s horrifying the things so many inocent people have gone through during all of this. All these videos of the horrible things happening to these helpless innocent people is heart breaking. I cant imagine what that kind of fear is like
Why show biden.....he does not care he cant even speak. Nbc and your kind to blame.
Biden that been happening to Palestine for years! I hope Palestine wins!
Our government cared more about parents speaking up in school board meetings then actual terrorists
Level Gaza. Leave nothing but rubble
Nedaj Boze paste u njihove rule. Zlocini!
"Western medias are hypocrite, they always follow double standard in terms of humanity. They never talk about the oppression to innocent Palestinian people and illegal occupation of Israel. They portray Ukrainian resistance against Russia as bravery and patriotism where resistance of Palestinian against occupant Israel as terrorism, hypocrisy level 👏👏. Boycott western media as they always provide biased and guided opinion instead of facts."
TERRORIST NATION finally coming to JUSTICE..........
"Hamas cannot defeat Israel,  they should just assimilate.  The Palestinian citizens elected Hamas, AND Hamas does not want peace,  they want DEATH."
I REFUSE to listen too your LIES!
The M4s the Hamus fighters are using are suspected to be from Afghanistan where Mr. Biden left them for the Taliban.
"How is he not crying while talking about his mom? Jesus, id be completely in tears if i had to talk about that"
"So glad Biden and the Democrats left all that militarily equipment behind and gave 6 billion to Iran... They wanted this to happen, you can&#39;t get rich with Peace nor does it serve the global agenda."
Collective Punishment of an innocent group of civilians for the actions of another group is a War Crime.
Jo BrainDead releases billions to Iran and now sends Money to Israel.
Hamas don&#39;t even know what they did. They kicked over a hornet nest.
"Propaganda is when the media forces a biased emotional narrative in order to create appeal for a decades long aggressor. Israel has been taking Palestinians hostage for decades yet it’s only “newsworthy” when the attacker is met with reprisal. When the propaganda is fired off on all cylinders from the news networks, you know that what comes next is significant foreign aid by way of American tax payers to the tune of billions already on top of the billions given to Israel’s military annually."
How are the hostages? 🙏🏼🤨🤨🤨
"Rachel Maddow, please read.<br>You have Canadian blood, why you smarter then most.<br>Two huge concerns. <br>Hamas Charter and Prime Minister of Isreal,  Bibi nickname or Benjamin Netanyahu. <br>Tainted news from anywhere in North America and even now throughout the world. <br>I listened to podcasts from Israel. <br>I learned that Hamas Charter includes the destruction of Isreal in their Charter and piece will never be in it&#39;s plan.<br>2nd, more important,  the right winged Isreal government, led by Bibi probably knew this attack would happen,  in my opinion. <br>Missiles were sent into Ocean from Gaza Straight days before.<br>Palisanians were entering from sealed borders weeks and months before. <br>For the most Guarded border in World,  why wasn&#39;t there any military guarding this border on 50th anniversary of last attack from Gaza?<br>Did Bibi want this to happen?<br>So that Isreal could wipe out Gaza Strip?<br>Rachel Maddow,  you have more contacts than me, I&#39;m just an old retired guy who thinks Isreal was let down by their right winged leader.( kind of like Trump).<br>Please investigate this.<br>Isreal people are also questioning their Prime Minister. <br>You could stop a major war, you could stop a war that could lead to WW3. <br>Thumbs up that even though you born in USA, you have Canadian blood."
6 billion dollars two weeks ago- to Iran the number one terrorist supporter ...go figure! Biden may not do anything unless he can make some $$ .. he is the worst President
Don’t hate each other hate the War Machine!! So sad learn from Ukrainian…😢😢
Jewish terrorists has killed more than 900 innocent Palestinian.
The enemy of the God of Abraham is also my enemy. Prayers for Israel always!
Who was there first stop the lie
I&#39;m what movies and dreams are made of. I&#39;m so handsome. I&#39;m so romantic. I can never manage to understand it. I understand spit. I should have flown by Earth singing my otherworldly planet&#39;s anthem. We come. We come. We&#39;ve come in peace. Me and my brilliant space machines invincible and at any time invisible. Hahaha well sounds terribly amazing.
"2,000,000 dead in Ukraine"
Do they have any cages for them.!!!
They should negotiate the release of as many as they can. When you have all you can get. Then act accordingly. Imho.
"When studying modern history, one big lesson is that you should never let the British divide anything. They can’t do it right. I don’t even trust the British to slice a pizza."
"America is next to you, I&#39;m outside"
My high school friend was kidnapped at that festival and is now stuck in critical condition at a hospital in Gaza. <br><br>I&#39;m just praying that my family and friends are staying safe🙏✡️
We can thank Trump because of him this didnt happen sooner with Clinton
Hamas are coward....making civilians their shields.
Biden didn&#39;t care babies were killed in Lahaina he spent it on Vaca. And only sent each family 700 bucks and took their land but I&#39;ll bet we&#39;ll spend billions on Israel sad part is this happened just weeks after we released 6 billion to iran.
Hey look it’s Lester holt the guy who went to North Korea and tried to make it look like heaven
Sad that our government loves apartheid
"If &#39;everyone&#39; treated &#39;everyone&#39; like gold, they&#39;d be sharing bread and wine instead… <br><br>No time or space right now for any soapbox pontifications that anyone would care to listen to, so I&#39;ll reach for the poppin&#39; corn and watch the other thing man knows best unfurl…"
Show us the dislikes
"This is so so sad but I wouldn&#39;t count on Biden for anything especially something so sophisticated as to get these people back, he just doesn&#39;t care"
Secure our Americans? Like in Afghanistan?
"Israel has been bombing, killing and torturing Palestinians like dogs for a long time now. Karma sucks."
"Well thats weird! I dont see folks dancing in the streets of Gaza any longer.<br>Is the block party over already? If so, that was short lived.. I wonder if they&#39;ll be back anytime soon?<br>Thubs up = Israel<br>Down       = hamas😅😅"
All i see is citizens dying were is the so called  dead hamas attacker&#39;s?
Mental illness is real🤔. These leaders are destroying the world 😢. God help us ALL🥺🙏
Media propaganda at its finest
Sad that god bless Israel 🙏🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱
Sleepy joe helping everyone but Americans.
THIS WAS PLANNED SO IT CAN JUMP OFF IN AMERICA!!! ARE THEY HERE NOW???
When will they ever stop fighting? This goes back to dinosaur era.
😂😂😂😂😂😂👌👌👌🤌🤌🤌👆👆👆👆👆الموت جايكم
AMERICA 🇺🇸  1ST. AMERICA ONLY AND ONLY AMERICA.  LET THEM FIGHT THEIR OWN WAR.
Donnie Trumpy eats big Macs
This is awful! But Israel needs to handle their own battles. It&#39;s unfortunate. It&#39;s evil. But I don&#39;t think we should send troops. No Americans should die for this. And for the Americans over there. They knew the risk when leaving the homeland. Im just  saying...but I mean of course nobody thought something like this would happen...but idk...im just giving my humble opinion.
"That&#39;s not retaliation, it&#39;s wholesale murder and destruction of 2 million hostages in Gaza"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6G6MWe6IQ&amp;t=2m55s"">2:55</a> Did he really expect Ambassy to call him 50 times?"
NBC NEWS IS FAKE!!!!
"When it&#39;s the Hamas who were barbaric, the world could sort of see that these were people brainwashed all their lives to hate Israelis and to sacrifice their lives towards the destruction of Israel on top of being pressured to live an impoverished life under Israeli fences in a small sliver of land filled with hatred, atmosphere conducive towards savagery.<br>There can be only condemnation of those murderous acts.<br>However, the same world consciousness is wondering just how much savagery and killings are the much more aware Israel is capable of? The world knows that Israel holds all the big high tech weaponeries. The world does not expect Israel to be as brutal as the Hamas.<br>The world opinion wonders after the actions of Tel Aviv when it disallows water, food and electricity from reaching Gaza while knowing the civilians in there will suffer mush hardship because of terror program beyond their wish and, or control.<br>Israel must stop with the brutality of her violent retaliation and start heading for the negotiating tables before more lives are lost. <br>Both sides have made their murderous points in the most brutally effective way.<br>Enough with the violence.<br>Time to create condition conducive towards peaceful cooperation before new reasons to hate are created in the hearts of children who wonder what they have done to deserve this madness.<br>Enough.<br>Enough with the violence.<br>Let there be peace."
hmmmm!!!!
Is the destroyed area in the opening shot Israel or Gaza? It looks like the results of Israel hitting Gaza.
NBC “News” sucks….
Fake media
Democrats have been supporting Free Palestine for years
🇮🇱🇺🇸
No way Americans will ever give up our guns!!
I get hamas wants to send a message but they are literally dooming their own people. We must be grateful to not live in Middle East because this can happen in any country over there.
Wait till Iran gets involved.    Joe Biden will get america into another war we have no money for
Your. Responsible. Leaving. Iraq. All the. Tools. For. Them to. Attack. Israel. With Hamas. Biden. Is. Evil
Biden is too frail to lead this war. This is our final one.
Is anyone going to open up the volunteer door
Israel ben attacks since 1967 terorist attack killing evin baby’s in gazze kudus it’s shame that still defending Israel Israel is terorist state
Biden just released the money to Iran no coincidence the American people are not stupid unless they vote for Biden again mail in ballots😊
Biden doesn’t care he’s the laughing stock of the American people
"Most Likely, a False Flag operation... the US/UK/EU Elites will Fund Terrorists that take Innocent Lives to Create Conflict Anywhere in the World so they can Push for More Endless Wars! NEVER is Peace an Option. MORE WARS from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, West Africa, Sudan, Somalia, Ukraine... When Will World Ask for Peace instead Funding Endless Wars, Death &amp; Destruction?!!!!"
I must establish my own personal island kingdom with the greatest technology. My palace all gold and ruby red emeralds. Perfect. My Throne inscribed The One. Perfect.
Israel needs a 2nd amendment!!!!!!!!
"ISRAEL just going about their daily lives, when they were attacked,  just like Republicans here in America being attacked by insane mental Satanic DEMONCRATES,  sham on those who are dancing and laughing showing photos of beheaded dead babies here in America and Americans DOING NOTHING,  GLAD I WAS NOT THERE  WHEN THEY WERE PARADING LAUGHING AND DANCING SHOWING THOSE PHOTOS OF THOSE BABIE I BE IN JAIL"
"Alright. Enough is ENOUGH, where is Scrappy Coco?  Send him in"
Brutal occupation will create brutal and barbaric mentality
"I feel for the folks, but anyone calling for the US to rush headlong into the fray to rescue US citizens need to consider the implications of such action. Directly involving our military to save 20 Americans could easily lead to the death of thousands of Amricans should such actions trigger Palestinian allies to take up arms as well. Decisions made in the coming weeks could determine the course of all human history going forward."
Nasty Palestine
"This is why you buy a AR15 , specially if you live on the border."
The wording of this headline tells you everything you need to know about the media
Heartbroken by the results of terrorists!
Any credibility the Palestinians had for their cause.....any remorse myself or someone from the west may have had.....went right out the window today when it was reported about the 40 kids and babies....some missing their heads in a big pile. The Palestinian public is just as complicit in this attack as Hamas themselves for electing a terrorist goverment to lead them. They litwrally exist with the sole position to eliminate Israel off the face of the earth....F%$K PALESTINE! Israel needs to just Annex the whole of Palestine and call all that area ISRAEL......
Democrats: tRuMp wIlL cAuSe WWIII.<br><br><br><br><br>Sound familiar?? Who’s president now??
"US media: only show news when Hamas started to fight back, but never educate people with the ongoing blockade, sieges and killing of Palestinians by the settlers and the IDF. The narrative is to pain the Israel as victim. <br>At this point, might as well say the Russia is the victim cause Ukraine is reacting back"
free palestine - return back their land 🤐
Democrats and Hamas 2 of the same remive sanctions that allowed Iran to sell Oil and get 86 billion dollars the 6 billion is bad but the 86 billion from all Sara sells is directly on Joe Biden and Democrats the blood of all these poor people is on the Democratic Joe Biden allowing week policies allowed Iran to give billions to terrorist. Cutting baby&#39;s head this is disgusting Joe Biden a Democrat or definitely completion
free palastine
Israel are animal just like bush jr sr trump putin saudi
"why is attacks from hamas refered as terror attack while israel cutting water, electricity, fuel, food to 2.3 million people, half of them childs is not refered as terror. I am disgusted by this world."
"Well, it seems like kids born in the Gaza strip in the 2000s grew up with this tense status quo for decades. They became radicalized and decided the only way to break this status quo is violence.<br><br>Not a good plan."
According to my perfect calculation? The rulers thereof believe on me Drizzle. Ah I sense some have even been waiting upon my arrival. Nothing hid from Drizzle. I catch everything. I do everything on purpose. I&#39;m the smartest being. The perfect being.
I’m really surprised the Americans have any allies left at all.
why don&#39;t use himas fire back Hamas?
"VIOLENCE begets violence.  i just kno personally, I would never live near a jihadist country or one that harbors terrorists or jihadists. but if you want to live in the ME, then there needs to the expectation that you or your loved ones might lose their lives to hapless violence. SAd reality.  In an ideal world, these old conflicts would have been nipped in the bud and the ME could prosper just like the rest of the world."
Yahudi Israeli cancar of earth
"Israel held back for many years,but they would take only so much"
It’s not a terror attack. They want their land back.
"Joe biden, becoming our president, didn&#39;t just hurt us.  it seems to b destroying the world...   thanks for all ur propaganda nbc.  Had it not been for ur non stop propaganda..  I&#39;m not sure the world b in this spot..  dirty, sneaky people.."
They said 1000 Israelis dead and 900 Palestinians (not used to seeing these numbers on the israeli side)yet 30 seconds of coverage for the Palestinian civilians and 6 minutes of coverage for the israeli civilians and troops 😂thats clearly unbiased and neutral reporting right there since all civilians are equal…no favoritism here
Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸
"There needs to be concerted effort to stop both sides from doing what&#39;s going on.  Gaza has under a land, sea and air blockade for 16 years!  A 2 -state solution should be backed by all nations and Isreal needs to stop building settlements on Palestinian lands.  No one should live under oppression."
"Israel doesn’t want peace, they want vengeance. They even said so. They’re using this as an excuse to commit genocide."
"Do United States government, talking trash once again"
When they say Biden take responsibility is this code for sending Iran another $6B? 😅
All lied same as 911
Not America&#39;s problem. we have enough
"2.3 million people are gonna die without a single support from the nationnal community, while 1 dead ukrainian is equal to literal billions in aid. crazy"
"If the Palestinians wanted peace, then they would inform the IDF where the hostages are?😮😢please"
And I bet them rockets ware left in Afghanistan when we left and sold to them to shoot at Israel again one more reason Biden need to be in a prison
We truly wonder how much of the $6Billion dollars in cash Biden gave to Iran and the $48Billion dollars worth of military equipment and weapons Biden gave to Afghan Terrorists was use to attack Israel.???
Israel hasnt even begun its retaliation.<br><br>The Palestinians are about to reap the whirlwind.<br><br>I fear we may have a real genocide on our hands pretty soon.
We have such a weak and pathetic president.
Why even go to israel
Not under Trump !
Sending love to Palestine 🇵🇸 ❤
If you wanna be protected by the us don’t leave..simple..
Showing same video  again and again
"Give Iran another $6 billion dollars.  You negotiate with terrorists, children die. Shame!"
US: Israel attacks with modern weaponry: 👍.<br>The Hamas attacks using conventional method available to them: Terrorist!
Wouldn&#39;t happen under President Trump
"This world planet is far far behind me. I&#39;m 33,34 44 on Earth above and far far beyond. I&#39;m an otherworldly extraordinary extraordinary extraterrestrial. I&#39;m the smartest being upon your mankind&#39;s planet. Ripley&#39;s believe it or not. The nations are all together confounded by your own personal created circumstances. I should be King even governor over this entire planet. If I were any nation I&#39;d crown Drizzle. With my brilliant understanding leading the way? I can see a new one world coming into view. There are none like me. There aren&#39;t any with my exact brilliant understanding. With the technology mankind possess? I&#39;ll bring all societies fractions into unity with complete solidarity up under one banner. Hahaha no not David&#39;s nor Bruce&#39;s although both sound incredible. Yet. Yet mine&#39;s. My brilliant thirteen worldwide view laws will be sufficient for the whole. The whole table. Who has ever gone where never mankind has been before?"
"Nice of grandpa to chime in days later.  No more thoughts and prayers,...<br>hope for justice."
I hope the kaaba is still standing 🤭💥
No terrorist really cares what Biden says they don&#39;t take him seriously &amp; literally laugh at his dementia
Stay strapped or get clapped
"Ya’ll was never praying for Palestinians while Israel has continued genociding them. The actions of Hamas should be condemned, but this violent retaliation was inevitable, and is directly brought on by the continued violence that Israel has subjected upon Palestinians."
"Holy schneike...99.9999% of the media and politicians are falling over themselves to kiss the golden bagel.  I was watching AIPA&#39;CNN and wow, what are the odds?  Every single one of their correspondents have the same opinion (objective journalism?) with a pro-Israel bias.  It&#39;s times like these that pull the beanie off any confusion about who really owns the U.S. government.  I think American wyt falls on the side of Israel because they identify with a shared historical path...invade an occupied land, slaughter and round up the natives, throw them on an undesirable tract of land, culturally and economically oppress them...ring a bell, America?  It&#39;s also pathetic/predictable how Israel&#39;s PR narrative foot soldiers do their sneaky little Americana vernacular deal where they try to bond and trigger the heart strings of Americans by playing on nostalgia with terms like &#39;terrorism&#39; and &#39;9/11&#39; and &#39;Pearl Harbor&#39;...to loosen the U.S. Treasury purse strings."
Oh now you need the military 😂 and government help.
One thing me and Biden have in common
Free Palestinians
Those arent americans. Theyre dual citizens.
Israel never proof there fact false flag terror israel.
"Matthew 24:1-51 Jesus left the temple and was going away, when his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple. But he answered them, &quot;You see all these, do you not? Truly, I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.&quot;"

So the solution is just to bomb everything? I guess.
Corporate media is dead. The majority of the people r gone.
NBC = Nothing But Crap. You are the people that promotes Hamas.
Can you do some coverage please on the bombs in Gaza?
Israhell terrorists not hamas
Palestine is a giant prison
"i never expected to witness something like this in my life time, my condolences to the victims of these unnecessary wars"
"In a war. Theres no innocent or civilian. If you are waving one country or group of military flag. You are one of them. End of the day, that is and that was how Israelis and its people slowly draw new borders on the map anyways. Pushing 2 millions people into a rat town. Asking how those people gonna react when theres forces on every direction of their life. Well. From 1917 to 2023. I thought modern day human are much smarter than their grandpa. But no. Still save old story about lands and spaces to make money from foods and water."
"Send 10,000 Marines and end this."
🎉
So Israel is killing the hostages and justifying genocide and we&#39;re okay with that? Interesting.
Gaza hmm. Israel is th terrorist
Religion…not evil or anything.
When a Bully gets punched in the mouth ... they run to a bigger brother ( USA ) to fight his battles for him
Hamas are baby killers
"So tragic, but did he go when Palestinians were dyeing? War isn’t good for anyone."
Biden will talk the talk but he won&#39;t walk the walk
Just remember they&#39;re still innocent victims on both sides! 🤔
israel been killing innocent for 75 years now genocide in gazza
Anyone else miss trump?
"Can’t stand nbc fake news or this joke Lester, sorry l am out"
Maybe you don’t throw a loud rave a few miles from the country that hates you for stealing their land
Don’t blur the video.  People need to see what the face of evil looks like.  Hamas must cease to exist.  Any other result simply lays the seeds for the next atrocities.
Haha war gets me excited and the fact uncle joe sent iran 6 billion gets me hard!!! Way to fund ww3
I keep imagining the mode switch between some awesome desert festival and being chased down by homicidal maniacs.
Look at Kamala 😅😂😂😂😅😅
NBC supports the baby killing rapists. Never forget that.
"don&#39;t be mad at the facts ..  be mad at the leaders who hurd the poeple to believe what ever they want to feed your ears.. and they just follow with out using an once of intelegants.    no use of the brain ..   just look hear and do and say ..      programing your brains to see only filtered news and nothing is real  all stories are fabricated and people just believe..    and 10-20 years later when the truth surfaces,..   it&#39;s now too old and no one even wants to care to know the truth ..   does any one know any thing about that lands history?     i doubt more than 1% of all people know the truth ..   knowing that the truth is in the books..  read the torah read the quran.    read history look at the maps ..  follow and track back what these poeple did to end up hated by every one every where they go and why no one wants them in their country and why all of europe basicaly kicked them out and gave them a piece of land faaaar far away &quot;the promissed land&quot; as they call it.. ..   read why it was called the promiss land and when and also why it was takin away by the same giver after what event took place..      read real history read real books.. don&#39;t just give in to the masses and join the hurd of sheep..   god gave you a brain .. use it.."
"ISIS 2.0, FROM IRAQI PRISONS FREED AND SENT OUT? IRAQI MILITIAS TOO !"
Don&#39;t trust NBC News.
"Why arnt you Americans showing the 700 innocent palenstine women and children who were killed last night by isreali air strikes? American killed 1 million innocent Iraqi&#39;s, are they not terriosts"
This will be happening in the U.S. It&#39;s just a matter of time.
"Gosh, man, there&#39;s not much the president can do. I mean... it&#39;s pretty gnarly in there"
The terrorist is Israel ... next time show what they&#39;ve done to Palastine citizens you hypocrits

If you support freedom<br>If you support womens rights<br>If you support lgbt rights<br>If you support democracy<br><br>Then you must support israel
How can it be called retaliation when they are being attacked? NBC has declined so much over the decades.
The religion of peace.........
Bibles at work.
Just a illusion if Netanyahu or any Israeli gvt thinks they can Eradicate Hamas -Thousand more are joining  Hamas. <br>Its now 50 yrs Palestinians without a homeland. <br>Israeli can cage up 2.5 million palestinians in the Gaza and 12 million in the west banks areas.  Their flight for freedom will continue -its human nature.<br><br>World power is shifting away from US -UK -maybe new powers are more sympathetic towards Palestinians dream of a homeland.
And we are supposed to be the more  intelligent species? Human beings are despicable. I don&#39;t think the earth will let us live on it for very long.
Free all Palestinian hostages first
God sits as countles die in this so called promised land. What a joke. How do people see this and still believe theres a just and loving god??
ألا لعنة الله عليكم يا منافقين ....

So Israel isn’t above killing civilians too. Maybe they’re also the terrorists
"The END of Hamas (Isis)<br><br>NEWS FLASH: All the Hostages are Already Dead. Living Hostages require food, water, bathroom, and Beds. Dead Ones require none of the above. Militants had no problem slaughtering innocent civilians inside Israel, or 260 music concert attendees. <br><br>Promises of Safe Return  of Hostages is no more than a setup. It is‘Bait’ to draw in Israeli Soldiers to retrieve Hostages. Those Soldiers will be mowed down by Hamas Militants in pre-planned killing zones.<br><br>It comes Roaring like a Lion and will not stop until the Bloody End. Mess with the Best… Die like the Rest. It is Finally Time Israel takes off their kid Gloves Off.<br><br>The REASON Israel was able to Shut Off Everything is Because Gaza NEVER bothered to make their own Utilities. Israel took Gaza during the 6 Day War. Israel held on to Gaza as a security measure. Before Israel occupied Gaza, there was NO Utilities so Israel extended their own utilities into Gaza for Both Arab and Israeli Inhabitants. Israel gave Gaza back and Gaza kept relying on Israeli Utilities.<br><br>At any time Gaza could have built their Own Modern Utilities Systems. Instead they Elected Hamas as their Governing Body. NGO Money POURED Into Gaza to help them. Hamas spent the Money creating a Military Power instead. Daily attacks over the Border into Israel promoted Israel to build a Fence. <br><br>Gaza NOT Israel is to BLAME for lack of Utilities. Both West Bank and Gaza have used Israel&#39;s Utilities for YEARS, and not PAID Israel for Water, Power, and Sewer for years. The reason WHY Palestine (Gaza and West Bank) hasn&#39;t bothered to make their own is because they can BLAME Israel for Lack of Utilities. <br><br>Israel&#39;s BIGGEST Mistake was to give Gaza back to the Arabs. They also GAVE Back West Bank, Jerusalem, Sinai Peninsula, and Golan Heights they took after being attacked during 6 Day War. Israel did this to &#39;appease&#39; the Arabs in Hopes of Peace. That was a HUGE Mistake. Today, the only thing coming out of Gaza is Hate and Death.<br><br>It is possible Israel Hostages held in bunkers inside Gaza by Hamas will die during a long bombing campaign to accomplish the bombing strategies listed above. Palestinian Civilians inside Gaza will be warned by Israel before bombing. Leaflets will be dropped and Loudspeakers near Border will be used. Israel will try their best to inflict ‘Collateral Damage’ (Dead Palestinian Civilians).<br><br>Mess with the Best… Die like the Rest. It is Finally Time Israel takes off their kid Gloves Off. The Roaring Lion has been Awakened."
i don&#39;t think for a second the Israeli govt didn&#39;t know it what was coming... they let it happen and even possible made it easier for it to happen by leaving it wide open for them... now they got a green light to finish off the Palestinians.
"CORRUPT MEDIA HAS STARTED A WAR HERE  ON AMERICAN SOIL,  BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU ASK FOR ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, CNN, BIDEN FUNDED THIS WAR AGAINST ISRAEL $6 BILLION, your loved ones are dead"
NBC is trash. Hard to believe any of commentary

"They are not terrorist , they are just 75 years late from taking control of their own land , we all hate hitler because he took poland and france , but we dont hate isreal because they took palastine !!! , why the controversy we should never point our fingers on the bully but point it on who made him that way , 75 years and isreal took palastinian houses , lands , jobs , and there lives , 75 years !!, what do you think this will raise a pegion of peace , read the history from 1918 till today , I promise you, you wont feel that sorry for them , you will blame them from coming in the first place, let me simplify it to you , imagine some one came to your country and you gave him a home and feed him and secure him and consider him one of the family, then within the years he kicks you not only from your house not only from your job , but from your own land and country, he kills you children , your wife,and everyone you love ,well my dear reader thats what isrealians did to the palastinians , as newton once said every action has a reaction , and this action and reaction will go on and on and on ."
Biden and Harris funded this terrible tragedy - don’t forget that next time your tempted to vote Democrat.
send in the seals
Hamas is Israel enemy here in the US we have the drug cartels as our enemies and just walking around I wonder why they&#39;re not to rated terrorist
Never forget that NBC lied and covered for the bidens crimes in a blatant act of election interference to get him elected.  His weakness and incompetence is an invitation to terrorists all over the world.

Israel is not a victim but the cause of all this hatred
NBC/MSNBC will just watch America&#39;s southern border crumble. Israel is only the first step. Plan to protect your family. Biden won&#39;t.
These &quot;Americans &quot; are actually right-wing Israeli settlers who chose to live in kibbutz that are literally right beside Gaza. Why? For what purpose? These &quot;Americans &quot; made the choice to become Israeli citizens and move there. That lady who was a nurse had her children in Israel not America
Evil pure evil
The bad thing is during Biden speech half of it was him telling the story of fifty years ago when he became a senator but not what he&#39;s going to do to get our people back and help Israel
This is the WW3 on Armageddon battle field... It turns into it and is it. A fire set in Jerusalem that will not be quenched .

How is this Biden&#39;s fault? Lets put the blame on terrorists
Only religion can cause people to hate this much.
No more tax money for rich politicians that have stock options in military death dealers
It’s interesting that everything they said Trump would do- Joe Biden has done! WW3 is coming
Muslims beheaded babies and burned children to death.
How do these Hamas people justify random murder?  May God be with the orphans and widows in Jesus name
Israel is now committing a holocaust against Palestine that&#39;s funded with us tax dollars 😡
"muslims and islam are truly evil and chaotic, wherever they are there is war and suffering"
"No more sympathy for Palestinians, these people are full of hate who teach their children to hate Jews so they can continue the conflict for generations into the future. Palestinians need to be driven out of Gaza there can be no peace with these vile people."

Russia is back in the game. Wt us did to Russia by engaging him in a war with Ukraine and tried best to finish Russia but Russia gained power and now trying to drag us in this trap of Israel- Palestine war. Putin is the Boss. Very smart tactical move.

"If it really comes to this, would Hamas actually televise the murder, one by one, of these hostages? <br>Including defenseless women &amp; children?<br>Can you imagine the world&#39;s horrified reaction if they were to do, and we were to see, such a thing?"
Crazy how the media says that their militants! No they are straight-up terrorist! Pfffft!
"Yo, don&#39;t be throwing America in those problems. Being American isn&#39;t an entitlement for anyone to fight a war for you."
This is truly something I never thought I would see. My heart hurts for the Jewish people. It’s is stated plainly by Hamas as President Biden said that they’re goal and objective for such atrocities are purely for the extermination of the Jewish race. It is impossible to not feel for the Palestinian civilians who will also suffer but it is purely through the actions of the terrorist regime among them. I have no idea where we go from here &amp; am simply praying for the most peaceful end possible.
44 Jewish Babies were beheaded. <br>Palestinians distributed sweets and danced while all this happended.<br>Palestinians have voted twice for Hamas with thumping majority. <br>People still side with Palestinians  is sickening.
Gaza is going to look like a moonscape.
A six-year-old that plays call of duty would have known how to take out that centrally located homemade missile battery within a matter of minutes not sure why it took Israel so long.
"You live peacefully in your house, an armed homeless takes your house by force and force you to live in the guests toilet, while his family raids on you each day. The judge says you should split the house but this previously homeless is well connected and never applied the court decision. You enter, exit and move upon discretion of this person. What is the right action from you? Cowardice or fight back to reclaim your home? Obviously the decision is clear unless you have been indoctrinated by this kind of media often sponsored by those who made the homeless homeless in the first place and brought him to your house to get rid of him."
Folks seen what he did in Afghanistan....chances of him helping Americans is slim to NONE
So everyone is against Hamas now right? We’re done supporting Palestine yeah? This is after Israel gave back the Gaza Strip in 2005. Hamas has been elected by Palestinians. Remember who is the aggressor!
If Biden don&#39;t do nothing for the 14 American life&#39;s lost. Then he needs to go!!!! American is not a country of p****es and cowards.
Praying for our journalists safe return. Sad so many innocent children and people on a whole losing their life to a senseless war.
Everybody with a brain warned Biden about this very thing 2 MONTHS AGO before he handed Iran $6 billion dollars. Godd job Joe. 👍😔😖😠
Its almost over guys. Just sit tight. 🚀🌏🔥🔥🔥
Ledt or right wing - We can not let this go Hamas.
Stand with 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Vote wisely! Hamas was voted in. Let that be an awakening call. Vote visely.
Biden started this war and Ukraine
"Palestinians have been being victims for over 70 years, thier women and children are dying under damage of buildings coz of israel strikes but nobody talks, this is unfair..  nobody talks about thier rights and keep calling them terrorists this is unfair, those boys who you&#39;re calling them terrorists has families as well,  they are fighting for thier rights, many of them are fatherless coz of israel, they have no choice, there is no other way to take thier rights and land."
"Hamas is only hard when beheading babies and r@ping woman, what a bums"
I against the terrorist atack to civilians but that what the Israelí government is being doing to Palestinians for to long and nobody condemned The ISRAELÍ STATE YOU CAN MOT EXPECT TO DRAW BLOOD WITH OUT CONSEQUENCES… MEDIA SAY ALL THE TRUTH NO JUST YOU’RE LIES…
"Sad for the victims. I wonder people dancing and cheering for Hamas all over , what’s all about? It’s a tragic or it’s celebration?"
Yes it is terrible what hamas did to Israelis and is terrible what you did to Serbia and their people.
"<a href=""https://youtu.be/6foH3Zc82ZQ?si=9tjZVamxmSVLUvQC"">https://youtu.be/6foH3Zc82ZQ?si=9tjZVamxmSVLUvQC</a>"
"Hamaaz positions? You mean civilian positions because, as all we know, Hamaz doesn&#39;t have designated positions."
What I don&#39;t understand is how Israel didn&#39;t see this coming with their sophisticated intelligence system
"Israel is just destroying buildings, not HAMAS.😢😮😅😮"
Biden funded this war on Israel. Then lies and says that he supports the Israeli people.
"US has a looming shut down, Israel must go to war, The Cabal War Chest must never be at risk of closing"
"No one wins in a war, high price to pay for all."
NO MERCY FOR PALESTINES AND GAZA!!! NO MERCY
"Why this media is so biased and deliberately misleading the public.  At least Mr. Holts, you have to be honest with yourself and deliver an accurate and honest news.  If you don’t report the true news, then be ashamed of yourself."
It is more like Hamas retaliation for 60 years of IDF terror attacks!
The Almighty God of peace cover them in this time of war. Yahushua Hamashiach send HELP

Support Israel and American 🇺🇸 🇮🇱
These people are nuts.  You deliberately go to a country where if you fart in the wrong direction it can spark an actual war.  Then they accuse the U.S. for not doing enough to protect them.  Where does your personal responsibility end?
We will make Russia build the Moon base and have a moon prison an send prisoners there for experimentation.

It’s war… not retaliation.
This is why everyone should carry a gun at least you have a chance

"Israel killed 10-20 times killed by Palestinians, they are not innocent, Israel killed more babies  and women btw a human life is equal regardless or their race"
Enough with religion. Fighting over the make-believe gods. The children are always the ones dying and suffering. Shame.
"Don&#39;&#39;t trust the insipid zombie necromancers in any form zombie oligarchy are not trustworthy especially, that Crow whom was buying Scotus. Follow the money, stop the underworld perpetrators of genocide. Follow the money. They are attempting a false narrative so they can steal 6 billion dollars in humanitarian aid. Think of all of the earthquake victims and refugees, that a suffering at the hands of selfish Imelda Marcos and company. Stop Charles Manson and Caiaphas and and every illicit liar profiting from any war. God will topple the animals whom are profiting from war, it&#39;s a promise."
Israel Apartheid on the Palestinians people is why this will never be over. FACTS
Poor Israel.. What about the poor Palestinians. You are supposed to tell the truth as journalists..OH please.. carnage?what do u think Israel does when leveling a residential building..Seriously.. who runs yout news?
Send some AC130 gunships
Well that’s how Palestinians feel for 70yrs my friends!!
I pray these terrorists realize allah does not except dirty murderers in his palace 🙏 but satin will except each one of these evil participants. These are true facts 💯. Prayers for the hostages 🙏

Please put on a suit!
"265 innocent women and 231 children already dead from Israel&#39;s bombardment in the past 48 hours. That&#39;s called Israel &quot;defending&quot; itself not terrorism by western mainstream media, because they see Palestinian lives as human trash with no value. Only Israeli lives have value to them."
"Hamas is not leaving Gaza, cried the Palestinians"
What causes islamaphobia? <br><br>This is your answer.
There needs to be perspective from the Palestinian side also.
Peace for both nation
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6G6MWe6IQ&amp;t=3m35s"">3:35</a> It&#39;s good that, as a matter of routine, Hamas are referred to as &quot;animals&quot;. Animals, though, unlike Hamas, are totally innocent."
"Lol, Joe saying Israel can defend itself and it should but what about Palestinians defending themselves from all the Israeli injustice?"
"I dont want to seem rude but the guy was demanding the US to act on behalf of mother. In my opinion that is not a good stance on why America should act and possibly bring us into war. We have to understand that this is between those two countries. It is too many Americans all over countries. But condolences to his mother, it was just an unfortunate situation"
Theres no way for Hamas to win
Theres no way for Hamas to win
THEY ARE NOT TARGETING HAMAS THEY ARE INDISCRIMINATELY BOMBING ANYONE AND EVERYTHING.  CHILDREN ARE DYING.
But biden wont send any of our military to go get the scum hamas
Don&#39;t belive that israel began the war by attacking muslims in aqsa mosque See what other people say and use your mind to decide
If the hostages dies. Their sacrifice will not wasted if israel won
Trump Supporters want a Civil War here if Trump is Held accountable for his many Crimes.They are Racist Hypocrites to Demonize &quot;Hamas&quot;.
Hamas attack called terror attack but Israel attack called against terrorism
I wonder how many billions of tax payer dollars we are going to send over there for the war mongering democrats
Such ignorance....
"Americans, excercise your right to own firearms. Be smart, be responsible, be alive. This mess is coming to the USA. Be prepared. Fight. Your family&#39;s life depends on it."
"Hamas is truly evil. I feel for both Israeli and Gaza citizens. Let&#39;s hope and pray Israel doesn&#39;t just straight up glassify the strip with airstrikes. Although, after seeing the bloodshed... I wouldn&#39;t hold it against em if they did"
They probably already killed the hostages just trying to use them as leverage. They aren’t very smart and it won’t work this time. The hostages are probably presumed dead in Israel’s eyes and there’s no negotiating with terrorists.
"Here is a hint, if you love your mom and want her to get released, dont call her captors animals…"
Israel has created the world&#39;s largest open-air concentration camp. There are ramifications for such actions. 70 years running now. The Jews only had to endure 4 years in WW2.
When will the world stomp out muslim extremism?
Israel intensifies terrorist attacks after massive Hamas retaliation.
"I understand their pain but there&#39;s not much the US is going to be able to do in this mess. How involved can we get? How many lives do we feel we can pledge to the cause of attempting to rescue American hostages? Soldiers are American&#39;s, too."
"I know that the liberal NBC news supports Biden and likely the hamas animals, but if NBC can put their liberal hatred for Israel aside, they would admit the Biden&#39;s hands are dripping with the blood of children and women onto every body that lie dead because of muslim evil. Biden is absolutely complicit in the murder of Israelis by these animals."

The world failed to bring peace to war torn parts of the globe only arms and war weapons today this is the sad reality please pray for all countries that are victims of war innocent people on both sides are perishing hopefully one day Israel Palestine and Ukraine sees peace including the rest of the Middle East
They want Israel wiped off the map. I believe it is time to play the uno reverse card on them.    <br><br>&quot;You have 48 hours to release the hostages and turn over all members of this terrorist government or you will be assumed to be combatants. &quot;
White people never wrong
Israel is the real terrorist. The world stands with Palestine. Wake up. Be on the right side of History.
Hold on to Jesus victims
Israeli citizens need to be able to be armed.  No 2nd Amendment there. Most Israelis have been in the military and know how to use weapons. This is so tragic. It make me sick.
I&#39;m out of Trump supporter but I got to say this is one week mother. Step up Biden
Why do only Israeli gets correspondence and a chance to speak up? Why not get some Palestinian people to interview? That way we can see what both sides say and get a more fair and true look at what’s happening? Even in court your hear both sides. WTH is this? This is terrible journalism.

Shut up it was not terroristttt attack it is their right to fight for their rights and land israel have been killing innocent civilians since 60 years and occupying palestine
"These are the last days, call on Jesus Christ the Son of God,"
Misleading media<br>Free Palestine ✌🏻❤️
Our prayers are with you Israel!!!❤❤❤
"Hamas and Iran have their own purpose which has nothing to do with freeing Palestine. Their goal is to destroy Israel, which is unacceptable, and not to free Palestine,. That&#39;s another reason why everyone should be condemning the attacks even those , like myself, who advocate the end of the occupation, a 2 state solution with a free Palestine. The attacks made this goal even more impossible and many innocent people will die for it, as Israel favors vengeance over justice, and the level of hate in this region is unbelievable. Hamas is a consequence, colonisation is a cause. What the Palestinians have been going through for decades is atrocious.And desperate people will either die in silence or rebel. Wiping Hamas from the surface of the earth will only raise another organization with similar objectives. Unless Israel wants to implement its own version of the «Final Solution», this madness will have to end eventually. Israelis have the right to live peacefully in security and dignity.  Palestinians have the right to live peacefully in security and dignity."
"This is sad, but can&#39;t negotiate with Terrorist"
There&#39;s no clean hands with this one but always check the way the media frames this to try to set the narrative the way they want you to see it.
🇮🇶🇮🇶❤🇮🇷🇮🇷❤🇦🇪🇦🇪✌️✌️
"Saturday being the Sabbath, a holy day for all Israel people❤😢❤"
Biden gave the green light! He paid for all this crap ! He gave them the $ wake up people !
"Sad, the Palestinians will pay the price. Israel won&#39;t stop this time, they will level the Gaza Strip."
"Well, Hamas signed their own death warrant. Israel needs to clean house. Iran next?"
Israel kills innocent people and prevents Egypt from sending food aid
تحيا 🇵🇸فلسطين❤
"Thats funny,i remember israel bombing gaza for years and killing endless amount of civilians but no one ever called those terror attacks. Both sides are terror groups imo"
Lester are there Palestines that are being harmed and not going along with Hamas?
"After the sneak attack by the Japanese, we fought a bloody Pacific war. And then we said,&#39;Enough is enough&#39;. I think Israel should fix this problem permanently."
<b>*****</b> NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPEND IF PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS IN OFFICE <b>*******</b> Palestine is only doing this because they know that NATO is tied downed in Ukraine which we should never be in that fight and if Trump was in office that wouldn&#39;t have happened either it makes me sick !!!!
"Good evening, I’m Bozo the leftist propaganda clown for corporate media ABC CBS NBC BLAH BLAH BLAH and my gov/corp sponsors just sent me to Isreal on a private jet to stay in a 5 STAR RESORT while I attempt to lend credibility to the state run media network🤪"
Killing hundreds of innocent people on both sides... the Palestinians deserve to have freedom and their own uncontrolled place.. but Israel treats them like Hitler treated the Jews...2 wrongs never made a right
The only way to finish a war is winning it.
"THIS IS WHAT THE ILLEGAL CRIMINAL MIGRANTS WILL DO IN AMERICA SOON,,BE PREPARED ,,"
I&#39;m sorry God Bless Ypu Isreal!
Peaceful community spreading peace
"This I feel so one-sided story why don’t you explain the other side of the story do you know what they say there’s always three sides to the story, his hers and the truth I’m only here in his I’m not hearing the truth"
"Biden gave iran the funds they need to to free up funds in other places to pay for this attack! Democrats doing what democrats do, spending American tax money to start a war, then fund the fight against the people who started the war and watch over the sea of dead bodies left in thier wake!"
What else do you expect from occupation..
Does anyone knows why they just annexed the territory and just build one country?
stop sending IRAN money JOE!
This is what the US wants they&#39;ve been planning this for a long time Ukraine was getting boring for them this is the new s***
I guess Ukraine wont get their billions now. Its Israels turn.
"The irony. The extreme hate Israelis have for Chririans, and the unending bizarre support Christians have for Israelis."
Israel is reaping what they sowed
Biden is RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS!!!
My Stocks are going through the roof!!
It&#39;s always terrorists when it is someone else fighting back!
"He can say animals, but I can’t"

O you mean that was not terror attack that was attack against terrorist
"Vowing American support,  to Ukraine, to Israel, to Taiwan. All with Americans struggling to live. How much support does America really have to offer? Nonsensical ecosystem!"
"Mockingbird Media perpetuating the MIC&#39;s agenda... <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%237countries5years"">#7countries5years</a> &quot;War is a racket.&quot; &quot;Beware the Military Industrial Complex.&quot;"
No mercy for the dirtbags of Hamas.
God Bless You Sir and Your Family! It&#39;s horrible what&#39;s going on!
"What about Ukraine,  what&#39;s going on there ?"
Biden has nothing to do with us dumb playing with senile crazy old man that you guys put in for president
Hamas are cowards. So pathetic!!! So sad to attack innocent people with weapons. Cowardly / Weak / Pathetic
All I see is hate and revenge. No care for one&#39;s own people and what consequences they sow. Nothing productive or conclusive about the indiscriminate murder of each other&#39;s innocent populace. They were on the cusp of change and a step towards peace. Now it&#39;s like medieval times.
You need to ask yourself what you’ve been doing wrong for the past 75 years this stuff isn’t gonna get any better it’s just gonna get worse so you need to ask yourself what have you been doing wrong?
free plastine
Does anyone know why the US isn&#39;t sending arms to the Palestinian freedom fighters to fend off the Israeli militants who keep stealing land and mowing down homes?
The Biden administration has funded this attack by giving billions of dollars to Iran. Iran funds and supports Hamas. Biden voters are responsible for this. Enjoy your tax dollars hard at work liberals.
Send them<br>MONEYYYY YEHAWWWW<br>1 for you 2 for me.
It’s a war and you reporting take cover it’s not worth it hind
Hamas are baby killers and those support them are no different
Oh 😳 the guy who hides underneath the car 😢😢😢
BORN IS THE KING OF ISRAEL 🇮🇱 😢
"Biden sent Iran 6 billion dollars to Iran, and Iran is funding Hamas. So you see what the president is supporting"
AND THE LOVING GOD DOES NOTHING.  AS USUAL.  Hides away like a cowardly politician.
I don&#39;t trust Biden and his political party since they funded Iran and supplied the Taliban with military equipment
Quit saying there are hostages. There are NO hostages in Gaza. Anyone taken back across the border was murdered the moment they got there. They paused only long enough to film a quick video to show on the internet then they were killed.
These people think they’re special you’re no better than anybody else on this planet
"Israel we ❤ love, we are praying for Abraham&#39;s Seed, stay strong as the Lion of the Tribe of Judah 🔜"
The us gonna help other other countries when we had thousands die in hawaii but no help for them
We are not responsible for Israel. Stop hiding behind America . Free Palestine!!
Stop lying.<br>Israel is the real criminal.<br>You cannot see how they destroyed the whole city Of Gaza.<br>You need to open your eyes and stop listening to racist  American News.
The Biden administration could start by not give Iran any money.
So this is where Jesus is coming back?
Biden’s a fool
"It has been going on for 75 <a href=""http://years.one/"">years.one</a> sided story.they don&#39;t let you know why that happened."
Why are they not targeting the Rocket launch areas
"This is TERRIBLE, what kind of evil trash do this type of 🤬 🤦🏽‍♂️ WE GOT TO DO BETTER AS MANKIND! Why is WAR the solution when it never heals all!?"
There are more people killed in Gaza than in Israel .. 🙄
I trust Biden will do the right thing. 🕺
More than 27 Churches and 100 Christian houses recently burnt down and Christian graveyards destroyed in Pakistan
Seems like they should just go all out and fight the war already instead of never ending constant conflict. Just end it and one side rule. It&#39;s ridiculous. If you are waiting for &quot;god&quot; to solve things then it&#39;s never gonna happen!
What about the 253 Palestinians that were killed by Israel before this started.. they are 2 million people living like caged animals in a 16 mile area... they are not even allowed to have a chocolate bar!
GIVE THEIR LAND BACK.<br>AUTHORITIES AND COUNTRY LEADERS HOLDING POWER BE FAIR  OR ELSE YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING HUMAN ANIMALS.<br>What will you do if someone pushes your house doors and claim the ownership of your home. This exactly what happened and we are seeing the consequences of this.<br>SO BE FAIR USE YOUR POWER WISELY<br>It&#39;s not Hamas Terrorist but HAMAS PALESTINIAN ARMY fighting for their land back. My tummy turns to see America standing with Israel.<br>Just like Ukraine is doing. I don&#39;t see any different.
If you believe your mom is listening so too are those you just called animals. Don&#39;t expect a positive outcome with any provocation.
What about baby of Arab
The Democrats support hamas against Israel. They support ukraine against Russia. That is why biden released 6 billion in assets to iran before the attack. He out a down payment on it. He has blood on his hands..
الله ينصرنا عليكم ياكلاب عمركم بتحاربونا القادم اعضم
On one side Armageddon worshippers are cheering then on the other side Terrorist. While innocent people are paying the price. It is so Fukng Sick and inhuman. And saliva must be dripping down from the mouth of War Profiteers.<br>Fukng Sick 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
"So retaliation to an act of terrorism with terrorism, isn’t terrorism?"
The ppl there demanding that the US government find their missing loved ones seems extreme to me. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much hope for those poor ppl abducted by the terrorists.  With that said my heart breaks for all those innocent ppl effected by this senseless terrorist attack.
This is Israel&#39;s 9/11 not even Mossad saw it coming
This problem was created after WW ll…by US and its allies. We created a $h!t show.
Coming to a neighborhood nearby thanks to our open borders enjoy the propaganda 😉 😎

The expected war... when isreal did so much crime on palestinian and the western world so blind and double standard.
God Bless You Lester Holt!
Why don’t u tell news about Gaza. U r not showing the true picture on the other side. NBC please be fair.  This newscaster is very biased.
Level Gaza🐖🐷🐽
"After indiscriminately killing people in the streets, there are no hostages."
🙏 Praying for all the people 😢😢😢
Having a half wit mumbling doest look good for the usa.
Mentally indoctrinated to hate since toddlers - spiritually governed  by spiritual dark forces not of flesh &amp; blood. God Send Angel. Armies to defeat these spiritual entities- may we all cry out to God of Abraham &amp; His Son to destroy evil.
"This is why the 2nd Ammendment is so important in America. If the Israelis were armed like we are here, they could have fought back. Period."
This is so sad…. The only reason humans start wars is based on their own ideals of self entitlement…. Why can’t people just exist
Uummm he maybe shouldn&#39;t call them animals. They watchvthe news and may single her out
Sad one would think after years of this hate. They would seek peace.
Shalom
"Biden gave Iran, who sponsors Hamas and Hezbollah, 6 billion dollars. Money is fungible! It was supposed to be for humanitarian aid, but all it did was give them money to terrorize Israel, with the money it would&#39;ve used for that aid."
EVIL
I don’t believe they want a truce.
We are already in WWIII
From the river to the sea.
Gaza= concentration camp
"&quot;Increasing Retalitation&quot;? I wouldn&#39;t call defending one&#39;s country and fellow citizens from continuing attack &#39;Retaliation&#39;. Good job MSNBC, continuing your Pro-Terrorist, Anti-Israel spin."
"The Middle East would make a big, beautiful parking lot……"
"Gaza is an open air prison. Inhabited by people whos homes, land, and freedom were stolen"
This makes me want to join the military right now
Bidens a traitor..blood on your hands Biden. You&#39;re nothing but a mess of a selfish greedy president
Obama and biden gave Iran over 30 billion over the last 14 years. This money allowed Iran to finance this attack on Israel by Hamas.  The democrats have openly shown their hatred of Israel for 50 years.
Hamas = animals.  Turn Gaza to glass ?
Israel is the real terror
"Hamas is using weapons that Biden left in Afghanistan. Also, Biden paid Iran $6 billion. <br>No wonder democrats are supporting t-rrorists; communists are the same as them."
May Israel prevail against the terrorists
Somewhere american choppers inbound with &quot;fortunate son&quot; by CCR blaring overhead with giant jets drawing a big boot in the sky.
Anyone with a pulse seriously doubts Biden every time he says &quot;let their be no doubt&quot;.
"Biden helped Hamas and Iran do this.  Him and his administration are corrupt, greedy and Godless.  They knew that this would happen because both parties warned that this very thing would happen if he gave Iran the 6 billion and he did it anyway.  Obama did the same thing right before he left office.  This is sickening and they will pay the ultimate price when they are judged before God.  I pray for Israel."
HamAss butchered 40 babies by beheading.
Biden hasn’t a clue for what’s going on.
"Daily Prayer for the Dying<br><br>O most merciful Jesus, Lover of souls, <br>I pray Thee by the agony of Thy most Sacred Heart, <br>and by the sorrows of Thy Blessed Mother, <br>cleanse in Thy Blood the sinners of the whole world <br>who are now in their agony and are to die this day.  Amen.<br><br>Agonizing Heart of Jesus, have mercy on the dying."
why you call Hamas a terror attack?...Hamas   represents a nation...but when  American or Israel attack is not a terrorism....what about thousands of Palestinians killed?...these news media are si biased and controlled...its not fair at all.
Biden armed Hamas &amp; the Taliban!!!
"Somewhere American military contractors, politicians, and weapons manufacturers are popping champagne bottles."
If the US gets involved it will be the start of WW3...start storing foods before these days come
we dont negotiate with terrorists
Why do they not show all the human rights abuses “those people” have been doing to the Palestinian population?
Biden is destroying America; the Bill of Rights stands in his way. Attacks on the second amendment are against the Bill of Rights &amp; not for anyone&#39;s safety‼️💯
This fake war is nothing but a land grab by Israel.
War is stupid.
"Where was the outrage when Israel was terrorizing Palestine? Why didn&#39;t Biden denounce their apartheid? Why did American journalists FAIL to report the ethnic genocide of Palestinians? I&#39;m sure it has nothing to do with America&#39;s own attempts against Muslim nations.<br>The United Nations declared  the deadliest for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank since 2006, evidence of increased use of force by Israel, amid a further shift to the far right in the country.<br>On August 5, Israeli warplanes launched a wave of air attacks on Gaza, which the PIJ responded to by firing rockets at Israel. One of the main reasons why the conflict did not escalate was the decision by Hamas, which has governed Gaza for 15 years, to stay out of the fighting.<br>Despite that, there was considerable damage in Gaza, which has barely been rebuilt since the 11-day conflict of 2021. And the threat of another outbreak of prolonged violence has not gone away, leaving Palestinians in Gaza constantly fearful of what many feel is the inevitable next war.<br>Following a string of individual attacks in Israel that began in March, Israel launched a military campaign called “Break the Wave” that has included near-daily raids, mass arrests and killings in the West Bank, with a focus on Jenin and Nablus. Civilians confronting the Israeli army during raids and uninvolved bystanders have been killed, as well as Palestinian fighters in targeted assassinations and during armed clashes.<br>Israeli forces killed at least 170 Palestinians in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem in 2022, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, including more than 30 children. At least 9,000 others have been injured.<br><br>Several of the killings have caused particular outrage among Palestinians, including recently on December 12, when a 16-year-old in Jenin was shot dead while standing on the roof of her home watching an army raid. A 23-year-old Palestinian was also killed by an Israeli soldier in public on December 2. The killing was filmed and Palestinians described it as an “execution”. Observers, diplomats and rights groups have expressed “concern” over Israel’s use of excessive lethal force in the West Bank this year, leading to the high number of killings.<br><br>The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has previously noted that Israeli forces &quot;often use firearms against Palestinians on mere suspicion or as a precautionary measure, in violation of international standards”.<br><br><br>Killing of Shireen Abu Akleh - 51yo Palestinian-American journalist. On May 11, Israeli forces shot dead veteran Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh while she was covering a military raid on the Jenin refugee camp. In East Jerusalem, Israeli forces attacked mourners carrying her coffin. Despite the efforts of Israeli authorities, thousands of Palestinians filled the streets of Jerusalem for the funeral.<br>Multiple investigations have found Israel responsible for her killing, and Israel eventually admitted in September that there was a “high possibility” that one of its soldiers had killed Abu Akleh. However, Israeli authorities refused to launch a criminal investigation."
All is fair in love and war!!
F…n Biden left all the equipment for them to use it against Israel
This is so bad 😢
My most sincere condolences to the people of Israel 🇮🇱. Reciban mis mas sinceras condolencias y espero que la situación cambie muy pronto. 😢
seriously. when are this going to end?!! These people allow their religious beliefs dictate killing of innocent people.
My condolences to all who lost family members there.<br>One question?<br>Why live in a place with an ongoing war going on?<br>WHERE IS COMMON SENSE
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6G6MWe6IQ&amp;t=2m25s"">2:25</a> got an itch there, Joe?"
I am so sorry what is going on… For the lost life of innocent people from both sides and for the hostages to be safe. But how is the Biden administration going to take responsibility.
Waiting on America instead of the mist high show you thier the fake jews...
The USA needs to stay out of this. We poor.
"Yes, it&#39;s tragic and sad. But the hamas are animal behavior and evil. They have to suffer from what they started. Israel 🇮🇱 didn&#39;t do anything unless they woke up in Israel. I stand 1 trillion % with Israel 🇮🇱."
It’s pretty easy you watch for a missile flies off from then Send back 10 missiles that way.
"“To show that killing civilians is wrong, we’re going to … “ yeah, I can’t even finish the bit. Because it’s not funny. These are human being’s actual lives. Please stop killing people."
"Israel has the most sophisticated Military and intelligence apparatus in the  World and are facing a bunch of goons in Gaza.    They’re good.  They’’ll twke care of it heavy handily.  <br><br>Having said that, why do the US Taxpayers have to fork over more of their money for this?   We’re still supporting Ukraine,"
"I have no sympathies for Palestine, as I did not have sympathy for Afghans after 9/11. Palestinians are terrorists for sheltering Hamas, as Taliban are terrorist for sheltering Osama."
"If two stones in Gaza are still standing, the job isnt done."
Islam is a peaceful religion…..no worries
Israel just defended their existence being under threat by Islamic terrorists
"Le soutien des occidentaux a l&#39;occupation sionistes ,ne faite que (finir l&#39;existence de l&#39;occupation sioniste en Palestine depuis 1948) <br>💪FREE 🇵🇸 PALESTINE💪"
No words ! 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Fun fact the Palestinians offered multiple times that they wouldn&#39;t target Israeli civilians if Israel would agree to stop targeting Palestinians civillians. <br>Israel refused.
"This is interesting to me... babies off&#39;ed, men off&#39;ed, women graped sounds so familiar! Yet, when this is done to others its fine right? What about the Palestinian people? I hope you get everything! I really do! From the bottom of my heart!"
Worthless totally worthless
Biden needs to take responsibility for funding it! The money he sent helped this! Many Americans do not support nor claim him as president.
God I pray for Israel.      Please help al those involved!!
illegal israel
Gazans elected Hamas as their government. Hamas terrorists commit atrocities in Israel. Gazans now pay for their support of terrorists.
Let’s go Israel… not their leader..
Ukrainians are freedom fighters but when palestinians fight for their freedom you call them terrorist
There&#39;s is something that&#39;s need to be done now.
Will BIDEN admin sanction and bring resolution in the UN as a terrorist organization <br>2) Charge their leaders for hate and war crime as President mentioned in the statement. <br>3) HAMAS return all those hostage and move toward peace deal some one else not HAMAS they lost the world’s trust.
I would love to see a timeline showing this guy&#39;s hairline retreat further behind his skull.
Why don’t the US and Israel stop playing around and invade Gaza
Palestinians are being killed. Sad to see how much the world turns their backs on them. Jews took their land  . This isn’t fair
Remember when Trump was President.  None of this was happening. Good times.
The US paid for the weapons on both sides
How is possible in XXI  century people (NATIONS) BEHAVE LIKE ANIMALS FROM THE AMAZON  ???<br>NO RESPECT FOR LIFE !<br>ISRAEL 🇮🇱 HAS THE RIGHT TO EXIST !<br>THEY ARE GODS PEOPLE AND I PRAY ON BEHAVE OF ISRAEL 🇮🇱 🙏 🙌 ❤
"After the IDF comes into Gaza, expect the Palestinians to Eat Their Young (No water, food, electricity, gas, nor help). <br>Turn Gaza into a parking lot!"
"NBC, propaganda arm of the Communist Democrat Party (CDP)"
"The &quot;invasion&quot; was a false flag event (just like 9/11). The victims are the civilians of Israel and Gaza. This staged event will become known as the start of WW3. All brought upon you by the same criminals as WW1, WW2, 9/11, covid. Please stop the madness and stand in solidarity for peace with both the civilians of Gaza and Israel."
الا ساء ما تحكمون .. النصر لفلسطين وشعبها وكل مقاوم للاحتلال الاسرائيلي  ..
"The world is witnessing a Palestinian Holocaust inflicted upon them by the sub-humans condoned and supported by the collective west,  who claim that they have been the victims of the same in WW2. <br>Gaza is to the Palestinians what the Warsaw Ghetto was to the Jews. <br>To say that what happened was &quot; unprovoked &quot; is tantamount to saying that the Holocaust never happened."
"Jewi&#39;sh cow&#39;ards mur&#39;derers of innocent women,kids,elders and farmers..."
Fake jews the proof is in the Bible
"No, such a thing as israel"
"I feel bad for the Palestinians.  Most of them don&#39;t care about territory, they just care about feeding their children."
"Israel military response against civilians will guarantee the deaths of the hostages. Id say some hostages have already died to airstrikes, and Israeli military says it will shoot through human shields."
Biden you got us into this mess by releasing $6 billion in Iranian funds... now you vow American support? we&#39;re going to be spread real thin the longer this chicanery keeps happening
Israel is bait for the USA. Once involved Iran will pounce with their new $6 billion in free war revenue.
🩸🇮🇱🩸🇮🇷🩸Biden☠️Peace 🩸🇵🇸🩸🇺🇦🩸🇷🇺
We should send all of the MAGA cult over there to make a human shield to protect Israel. They can even wave their Trump flags. 👍🏽
Hamas is evil
None of this would have occurred if Trump was in office
"Bruh i didnt think the news would make me laugh, especially on such a serious topic. But not even 30 seconds in they had me cracking up. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6G6MWe6IQ&amp;t=0m25s"">0:25</a> &quot;demanding the biden administration take responsibility&quot; 😂 like did you seriously forget who you are talking about here?"
Israel should hold Biden accountable for this.
The solution is easy..<br>Establish the State of Israel in America<br>Hahahahahahaha
Quit treating Palestinian civilians like caged animals
"This was happening to Palestinian for 70 years.  Now, you might understand the feelings of Palestinian."
Palestines own people brought this on them. Terrorists are fine as long as they don’t cause you a problem!
This apartheid entity is never tired of killing innocent people.
Sad fact is that most of the hostages these beasts take do not survive the ordeal and many of those that do are never able to recover from the abuse. Better to fight to the death than be taken by such monsters.
Good job bothers in Islam
❤❤❤❤Hamas Gaza❤❤❤❤
Adultery fornication and islam dangerous to the world.
"If I was there I’d wish that President Trump was in the Oval Office.  He gets things done, he brought Americans home from all over the world, a silent truth you don’t hear about."
Why does it take this level of tragedy to get Lester to return to the amazing journalist that he is?
Fake news
Fake news
Fake news
No one sees the end of war but the dead.
Gaza needs to become the worlds biggest parking lot with the only thing living are the flies buzzing over the bodies
Free Palestinian fake news
Clintin news network is fake as ever
Since Hamas is murdering regular citizens in cold blood then I have no qualms with Israel leveling Gaza.
israel is terrorizing palestinian land.
Level gaza strip then make a park
Take heed America. Don’t give up your last freedoms…
Pray for peace to them ❤
"It makes me very sad that so many children and women on both sides of the conflict got killed but Israeli racism , apartheid and colonialism took them to this point of war.Also it’s very sad that our “democratic” government helps Israeli occupants 😡"
Good thing we have a strong president to carry us through these difficult times
Disgusting cult....Israel have rights to defend.
This is not a terrorist attack.. it is a resistance
Blaming Biden by the clueless republicans... This atrocity perpetrated by Hamas  will be paid for by Gaza innocents at the hands of a determined Israel.
Israel 🇮🇱  is God&#39;s
Too much lies in this video
War
completly ignoring innocent people who died on the other side. this is called taking sides
"If we had a president with a backbone, this would never have happened.....but no we have grandaddy cornpops too busy looking for ice cream and holding a bbq."
"Be real though, Israelis haven&#39;t exactly been kind to Palestinians over the past 100 years, by that I mean they&#39;ve been slaughtering them every single day."
Biden needs to launch a missile strike.
Perhaps they should have thought of that before putting Hamas in power. It’s day 4 today. The Gaza Strip should be leveled.
"Prayers to all the victims. Not surprising, people are making this political. What can Biden directly do. 😒"
Hola. Yrael
"Why is it when the Ukraine lobs rockets into Russia it is protecting their homeland, but when Palestine retaliates against 50 years of Israel land grab and occupation in their homeland it is terrorism?"
Religion of peace always going hard af
Your are fuktup
So that guy at the end was in a tank ? Why was there a tank out there before the attack ?
"WHY DON&#39;T YOU TELICAST ISRAELI ATTACK ON INNOCENT PALESTINE PEOPLE &amp; THERE LAND THAT HAPPEND EVERYDAY?  WHY DON&#39;T YOU SEE THE DEDBODY OF PALESTINE CHILDREN,WOMEN THAT KILLED BY ISRAELI ARMY. WHY ISRAELI ARMY ARE MAKING DRAMA EVERYDAY FOR GET US SUPPORT? DO YOU THINK WE R BLIND? WE DON&#39;T SEE ANYTHING? STOP ISRAELI DRAMA. STOP ISRAELI PROPAGANDA. FREE PALESTINE NOW. PALESTINE PEOPLE HAVE THERE RIGHT TO PROTECT THEMSELF &amp; THERE LAND."
Israel ❤
Who are the manufactures of all these rockets? Can these be identified by explosive forensics? Could these rockets be traced back to the weapons left in Afghanistan?
Free Palestine 🇵🇸👆🏼
"Just remember before WW3 , there’s an ad"
All I can say is Ala kiss my assai...😂😂
America is a big help with their war technologies. This has to be stopped soon. There is a peace after war 😥😥😪😪
Can Israel just hire the Chinese? Or at least learn from them how to deal with Islamic terrorism.
This is what happens when you send hundreds of missiles to another country.  What did you expect.  Country vs country only the leader will decide when to stop.  I expect Israel will not stop until Gaza is flattened.
Maybe let Gaza free and they won&#39;t do this
"What happened is unfortunate and disgusting, but I don&#39;t understand how people can blame any President for what happened, even if it&#39;s the PM of Israel. There are US citizens missing and some are dead, I don&#39;t know how much he expects the embassy to do. They definitely can&#39;t share details on what they&#39;re planning to do because it might get shared on the news."
Wow who payed money to these terrorists. I mean how are they funded my god someone should really look into how they afford such attacks
Why is Tlaib still in our government?
"Stop having kids folks! Spare them all the pain &amp; suffering in this cruel world we live in! We don’t have the moral right to inflict serious, preventable harms upon our children without their consent! Existence brings guaranteed harm &amp; is imposed without consent. Because a child cannot consent to being born, the default should be to assume that consent doesn’t exist and therefore, no action should be taken on the child’s behalf. Just like how it’s not okay to r@pe an unconscious person just because they can’t consent to your act! We all have a moral duty to uphold our unborn children’s rights to eternal peace &amp; freedom from all harm. Since eternal peace &amp; freedom can only result from remaining in the void, every human being has the right to NOT be born so long as they can’t waive their rights by providing informed consent to being born. Otherwise, creating a child without their consent is a violation of their autonomy followed by guaranteed suffering that they never asked for. The only exception to the consent argument would be if an action is taken to prevent an even greater harm, like pushing someone out of the way of a falling piano—assuming they were unaware, couldn’t react in time, &amp; wanted to keep living. In the case of procreation, there IS no greater harm from which you’re saving your unborn child, therefore you don’t have the right to act on their behalf especially since they’ll be the ones who will suffer the negative consequences of your action. Think about it for a moment, most people would be outraged if I, unannounced, ordered for them at a restaurant and forced them to eat that food – rather than they decide for themselves. But somehow, creating someone else to suffer and die is a decision you’re allowed to make for someone else?"
😂😂😂😂😢 فليسطين شواكركم يا خنزير انتا تالي مهرج 🤡☠️🔪🔪🔪🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿😎💪
hope for Palestines Success and return me and my brothers land back to its owners
Seems like both sides are terrorist
"Israel only cares for white european jews, orthodox jews, christians, and pocs are all victimized in the apartheid state of israel"
No free Palestine bots on this video? Was it the video footage that upset you? Weird.
Свободу Палестине от кровавых оккупантов.
Glass Palestine and call it a day
And how are we responding?  Where are our troops? Are we sending money? Weapons? Boots on the ground? Biden better give Israel more support than Ukraine has ever gotten.
God is still in control.
I&#39;m sick of media people like Lester Holt always traveling to locations where events like this are occurring just so they can make themselves part of the story. There is absolutely no need for him or other talking heads like him to leave the U.S. to cover this. It&#39;s performative. He makes the story about himself just 7 seconds into the piece when he says &quot;sending many of us into shelters&quot;. Who gives a rip if he had to go to a shelter. What about all the people who actually live there?
Were is the same energy when Israel did the same and still are
Biden Funded this war!!
I thought every citizen in Israel carried a firearm. Hmmm
Biden 6 Billion dollars back to Iran to fund the Humas to attack Israel must be a win win for him. Now he has you distracted from his failed Administration.
"Nice of you to dedicate 30 seconds to the Palestinians currently getting bombed into oblivion. 400+ women and children dead, and thats just the beginning. Disgusting one sided news from every media outlet covering this immense tragedy"
if you went to israel  you have no right to demand anything.
"If they killed hostages, it will start of total destruction of your nation. Those terrorists is lucky they never taste the years of Jorge w bush jr. They are all finish if his time today."
Level Gaza
Prayers for Israel
Free for Palestine
May Israel be protected from the terrorists of Hamas
"Seluruh dunia perangi kedua pemimpin Palestin Israel habis habisan, mereka membunuh orang awam, musnahkan kediaman dll, mereka 2 kaum berbunuhan, seluruh negara 10 kaum hidup bersama harmoni bahagia sejahtera..."
Money is not released to iran!
Hamas need to be execute
Isreal obviously doesn&#39;t value life..not even hostages!! This is not Democracy!! Its Hatted and vengeance! At what price??
Pray for the civilians of palestine
A lot of these reporters are behind Green screen.
Did this not happen to us?! Judgement is here!!
"Sounds like Biden needs more money, so he had Iran fire some rockets into Isreal to steal more money from American ppl, kind of funny how the American press is there the day it happened"
Biden sounds like a bad western movie.
This is not terrorists that liberations to Palestinian nations
How about we secure our borders and keep American citizens safe 1st? Mass deportation maybe?? Biden is a joke!!!! TRUMP!!!!
"Hamas F&#39;d up when they took Americans. They don&#39;t have any nukes and America doesn&#39;t like it when you take our citizens. They&#39;re all dead men, they just gave Israel the keys to the American armory"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6G6MWe6IQ&amp;t=5m29s"">5:29</a>, crazy how nonchalant the locals look"
How about some coverage of the American people&#39;s many woes.
"War.this situation,both side killed"
"Hamas has shown that it is not willing to play nice in the sandbox. The Gazans - those responsible for supporting the attacks on Israel and many thousands of innocent people - will pay a terrible price. There will be no measure of peace in that region for a long, long time."
I wonder what duty hands are behind this tragedy. Remember 9-11?.. something similar. My prayers go to all the innocents people from both sides there.
"Unfortunately isreal doesn&#39;t care about its people and peace. They know that the more force to Palestinian will create nothing but more resistance. Israel has been margining Palestinian for decades taking their freedom, believes which will create this conflict. I hope innocent people to stay safe and this guy mother to come back safe."
Time for Palestine to be a parking lot 👍
"You people feel sad and are worried about Jews. Worried about Americans first. Our children,parents,brothers, and sister&#39;s. Are the ones who will have to deal with this. If USA gets involved. Worried about your own Americans in these country. Fix this country first then worried about others"
"This is all awful, but regarding what Biden  said.  Um... Let there be a doubt, please.  The last thing we need to do is get involved in this."
Quit acting like Americans are a big deal!!  If we were a big deal you would do a better job of taking care of us as I pay taxes out my a**
I&#39;m very thankful I live where I do
Muslims 🤢
"OK this sucks, but why dont you show the carnage the Israelis have committed against the Palestinian people for the past 70 years?"
Netanyahu and the IDF failed those hostages and the citizens of Israel
Decapitation of childrel? 😢😢😢
This is not retaliation.  This is justified war against terrorists.  Israel needs to reclaim Gaza or they will never be safe from that border.  It is time to stand against antisemitism.  We are all Jews now.
Sucks can&#39;t travel abroad these days
I want to hear from Harris. Does she not work anymore
"Biden says he stand with Israel , my question is are you standing on their neck? Where is the cruise missiles? Even Clinton shot cruise missiles"
Killing kids and women is also normal in Ethiopia thanks for Nobel peace prize winner Abiy Ahemed. Down all terrorist.
Biden has caused enough problems. He can&#39;t be trusted along with NBC. They only show because of ratings.😢 Look at the borders yells it all.
Stop giving money to iran
Makes you wonder how many civilians Israel turned into new hamas members today
FREE PALESTINE
Destroy terrorism.  Many innocent people are suffering due to terrorism backed by a miserable religion and its disciples.  The entire world should unite and should fight with iron fists to eliminate it forever.
Slob joe will pick his nose lie Thur his teeth that about it
I dont think the russians are even this harsh
Biden is not the president election was rigged 👎👎👎👎💩💩💩💩
Pres. George Bush Jr. Said it right &quot; we don&#39;t negotiate with terrorists.&quot;
Crazy how aggressors of the world under uncle Joe . Bring back the MAGA king
This sucks! Innocent folks on both sides dying for senseless killings. <br><br>Don’t care who you are if you have a soul you against murdering and kidnapping. Unfortunately this has been going on for centuries and doesn’t look like it will ever stop
Why do everyone just want us to automatically jump in. Like can we plan something first. These ppl never ran a company or business or nothing. Rescue missions must be planned.
zionist propagandist. That is carpet bombing
He expects??? What was your mom doing living in a anti American state? Most likely supporting anti American beliefs. God in the bible destroyed a entire city for corruption. Gaza is corrupted
Ummm HES not American!
Israel stole Palestinian land. So who terroist?
Now the US will sell more weapons
Fake news!
Where is God&#39;s Mercy in all this?<br>Humanity mutilating each otherand all comes down to religion and hate!
Isreal should level Gaza.
Get ride of the commy gun control laws in Israel shameful people you should be armed at all times everyone shame shame on the Israeli government 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
By way of deception thou shall do war
"If your are living in Israel you understand why you need to give ur best to protect your own people.. Because some of those hamas is animals,, but not all Palestine is bad sorry for all the innocens involve in this conflict.. Someone always brought out the history of this two country, this is the proof why israel not easy to open thr boarder to Palestine a lot traitors is waiting to pound"
Hamas exists bc of Israel’s war crimes and atrocities. The UN and many human rights groups has several official reports on the DECADES of Israel’s impunity. FREE PALESTINE
Funny how this ended all of Netanyahu&#39;s internal problems in Isreal.... he gained the most out of the attack. Maybe think about that.
stop all Muslim migrants only.
Free Palestine
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Israel needs to continue their retaliation. The only way to stop evil is to destroy it.
Hamas is worst than animals
Biden funded this war before it even started. You think he wants to end it?? You forgot how money laundering works
Free palestine 🇵🇸🇩🇿
I pray Biden dosent give them more billions for hostages. I dont believe they are alive. They are beheading babies 😢
"The U.S should declare war, help dismantle Hamas and occupy Gaza."
We need Trump back where he belongs‼️🤬
They trying to bring the United States into this war ...they say that we got citizens in Israel an Gaza ...they become Palestine citizen and Israel citizen they no longer American citizens ...so why help them ...they choose to become Palestine citizen and Israel citizen..
what do you expect from the &#39;religion of peace&#39;
Stop fighting please
"Guess why throughout human history, time and space  // Pharoahs of Egypt, Roman emperor Titus, Abuchaddnazer of Babel, Hitler of Europe......they all hated Israeli Zionists  ⁉️⁉️⁉️"
Hamas delenda est
We should take over israel and make it a state !
The only terror committed is by the Israelis
Les still working with a cold 💪🏼 God bless and protect the people of Israel
Israiel terrorists nasions
Lovely spin on the story
Go israel
Please turn Palestine into a pile of rumble.
Israel is not a state... it os an occupation of Palestinian land.
"Zechariah 2:8-9 For thus says the LORD of Hosts: “He sent Me after glory, to the nations which plunder you(Israel); for He who touches you touches the apple of His (Elohim)eye. “For surely I will shake My hand against them, and they shall become spoil for their servants. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me.”"
God with Gaza and Palestine 💔🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
I pray 🙏 both sides stop the hate and just stop killing each other 😢.  May God bring peace and love to both sides
why not spend more money
"Let see how many times the media mentions the fact that Biden released $6 bil in funds to Iran. &quot;Oh but he didnt give them money, is was already theirs and he had to do it.&quot;<br><br>Hahahah nice try. He is in complete control of the sanctions. Dont be fooled."
Americans can&#39;t save the world.  Sometimes we need to stay out of thing&#39;s.  This is so sad. This is all in the Bible Mathew 23 Revaluations acts ect..
The people that support the attack on Israel are no different from the people who attacked the US on 9/11 <br><br>They don’t deserve to be in our country with the demonic religion
外國很奇怪不愛搞合理制度 就愛拼命生然後靠募集生活用品養小孩 。。
Pray all the time 🙏🙏🙏🙌
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
"I think it&#39;s highly unlikely Israeli&#39;s hostages are going to come home safely and alive. I think there is something that could be done by IDF for safe return of Israeli citizens is to abduct some of the hamas&#39;s important commanders and important figures . For that it has to be gun to gun land fight. If Israeli troops somehow managed to do that in real quick time then in exchange of Hamas&#39;s important figure they could save some of the hostages. I don&#39;t think so Air strike is much of a help for IDF only innocent civilians, women and children are dying from Gaza that is inhumane. It has to be ground level hand to hand, gun to gun battle. Life is precious specifically for innocents who had nothing to do with ongoing conflict."
Evil.
Stop talking Joe
I pray for the Palestinian civilians who are going to get the worst end of this conflict
This is why the second amendment is so important..... Who knows how many sleeper cells are here.....<br><br>Joe biden arms terrorists and disarm americans...
Genocide of the Palestinians! Fug Israel
"Go after Hamas, they were a pain in the butt when Egypt controlled Gaza.<br>Enough is enough"
terrorists they are fighting against each other ✌️🇺🇸✌️🙏
🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱
Propagandists just have to hit all of those useless buzzwords that no one with an IQ over 80 believes...
"Our Christian brothers &amp; sisters in that region are against Israel, and so are we!"
Free 🇵🇸
"The media ugly propaganda at display, telling us half of the story , biased opinions and alot of misinformation. <br>READ HISTORY, ask yourself,why the occupation still happening since 1948 and why we are supporting it when we all know its wrong to the core"
America ready for this with Russia soon. Keep attacking Trump but Biden bringing this war to us soon😢
"Israel&#39;s practices apartheid and occupation against Palestinians, so Israel itself has created the possibility of the current situation. As so often, Israel greatly exaggerates when responding to hostilities and this makes it even more difficult to achieve peace and stability."
You funded this attack 🤡
"The Biden Administration has no responsibility to provide extra services to JEWS with respect to Israeli descendants or those with relatives in Israel. Those insisting on that responsibility are insisting that JEWS are SUPER citizens, who deserve more rights than any other citizens automatically. Actually the government has a lot of problems right now. It cannot afford to do everything for everyone. The government has to first be able to pass a budget. Part of that may involve monies donated to Israel. However, to pass a budget is the #1 duty of the Congress right now. The Congress has a responsibility to 100% of the US population, not just to the 2.4% that are JEWISH. That said the US has historically supported the Israeli government monetarily and otherwise. The expectation would be that the Biden Administration would continue to do this. The only question is in what form. Still the US is in a lot of trouble for the whole of its citizenry (not just JEWS). It should act with the proper priorities. Passing the main budget is #1."
"Biden doesn&#39;t have any family on an Israeli energy council, they&#39;ll get no support from him.  Great God Almighty, is all the support they need.  May the Lord bless and protect you Israel."
"The world&#39;s leading terrorist state, my US government had the power to prevent this decades-long cycle of violence and inhumane and grotesque treatment of the Palestinians. Its actions and support of Israeli policies perpetuate the trauma, the violence, the anger, and the death of thousands of innocent children. But I&#39;ve suspected that U.S. hegemony and uncivilized power do not serve humanity or a higher power, but only its pathological self. <br><br>This is, indeed, a human tragedy! But where is the outcry when Palestinian civilians are slaughtered for decades? <br><br>As the scholar and Palestine-Israel expert, Professor Norman Finkelstein states: <br><br>&#39;The crocodile tears have begun over Israeli hostages taken by Gaza militants.  But Israel has held the 2.1 million people of Gaza, including one million children, hostage in one of the most densely populated areas on the planet for nearly 20 years.  In fact, Israel was the only country in the world to have legalized hostage taking.  Revered President of the Israeli High Court Aharon Barak held in 1997 that “a detention is legal if it is designed to promote State security, even if the danger to State Security does not emanate from the detainees themselves,” and that “detention … for the purpose of release of … captured and missing soldiers is a vital interest to the State.”  (The decision wasn’t reversed until 2000.) If the past is any guide, Gaza’s leadership will swap the Israelis for some of the 4,500 Palestinians being held in Israeli prisons on alleged “security grounds.”  Gaza is only playing by the book written by Israel.&#39;"
"Our government has zero responsibility to rescue citizens who were abducted outside of the United States.  I mean they weren&#39;t even in a US territory, they are 1/2 way around the world and they chose to be there."
Hamas could be in America you would think every news station would share that with viewers.
Israel dont stop until gaza doesnt exist anymore.
If thry want to quit then they could come out with hands up.
Biden is a weak puppet and a do nothing President
"War in the Holy Land.. we are in end times. The one’s we lost are already gone, He called them home <br>WE are here for a reason. Make it count ✨<br>God Bless us all"
"And people want you to believe Biden actually won the presidential election in 2020😂😂 oh yeah, I can’t even hardly speak. Doesn’t even know what’s going on."
That hamas members are all cowards
What a fuuuu people …
Hamass is made from &quot;Palestinians&quot;/Ishmael.
"No country should take this pigs let middle east saudi take this people as refugee. I am 1000% sure no one will take them including iran, turkey, saudi etc"
American civilians have no business in these unsecured countries
“Freedom fighters” executing wounded civilians and robbing their bodies. Can you sink any lower?
Stop calling them hamas terrorist.<br>Call them what they really are Pakistan civilian
Those videos of the people driving cars and then getting out and hiding from those guys and then those guys walk up and shoot them three or four times shows you they don’t care about their own civilians much less anybody else
Biden is a joke
Another setup pearl harbor moment. Biased reporting
"“ WAR IS OLD MAN TALKING, A YOUNG MAN DYING”  <br><br>-GOERGE WASHING MACHINE"
"You are so brainwashed into believing what you are being told.... ridiculous foolishness. Terror attack? It&#39;s happening from those in control , not outside forces. Wake up to reality!!!"
Why involved the innocent. Armies to armies is ok.
We r coming
israel was behind 9/11 and we still give them money.  they needed us in the moddle east for their protection.  Israeli leaders have alll said 9/11 was great for israel.  dont forget the Israeli instant messenger warning israelis on 9/10 to stay away from twin towers
"Start Massive Deportations NOW! If you&#39;re not a citizen, you must go!"
All the world show bad colonial sionist
Israeli army and Hamas are both terrorist forces fyi
😡😡Trump shared Israeli secrets with Hamas😡😡
"Hey Israhell,  IDGAF. <br>It&#39;s called karma.<br>50 years of karma."
status quo
"Duh,<br>Must clear ALL GAZA from any and all militants"
How do you escalate a threat !
"Lester, why are you there? Please come back to New York,  we know you&#39;re about that life ❤ But be safe out there and take care ❤"
"Israel and Mossod allowed this attack to happen just like the US with Pearl Harbor and 9/11. Open your eyes people, you really think Israel didnt see hundreds of people walking through a fence and driving around in pickup trucks ? That is one of the most protected borders in the world. <br><br>Military Industrial Complex got the war they wanted."
Imagine goin to a drake or Beyoncé concert an all of a sudden the city gettin blown an shot up. Wild stuff
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱
Leftist protests in israel has been stopped. Isreal will be democrat but state has stopped that. Real dangerous is faschist adolf netanyahu! Possibility let killer hamas to attack to israel and now he will be supported by lots of jewish. People will love netanyahu and support his politics there. Netanyahu and faschism win again by HAMAS. And millions of stupid support states or terrorist group and kapitalist projects
I wonder if lgbt will add a star on their newest flag soon
Should stay both<br>They own land
"This is what happens when you keep a population in a outdoor concentration camp for 75 years, and dismiss any help. Just keep supporting the occupiers."
And I am sure Hamas has WMDs …

Free Palestine 🇵🇸
That man at the end is the most powerful most dangerous man I’ve ever seen he will not stop until his people are safe!
"All these decades of Israel, torturing, tormenting, kidnapping, killing innocent Palestinians nobody said anything and they actually called it “peace” when Israelis are killing Palestinians. <br><br>You can only oppress people for so long before they start rising up.  Beck is a b-itch and even if they die trying what do they have to live for. This generation grew up seeing the atrocities of Israel from the time they were born. What do we expect?"
Sleepy joe
Babies being killed? Really Biden? America is the first murderer of babies.
Netanyahu = Childkiller (terrorist)
the end is near 😮
The worst part for the civilians is Hamas uses them the civilians as cover and shields. They also fire rockets from civilian areas that’s why they bomb those area!!!
Send the troops!
"May Isreal stand strong. To any Palestinians, you do not have to chose death. Repent and serve God. He loves you even still and you are redeemed in Christ."
The war between the Palestinian and Israel has been ongoing for several thousand of years and tragically there will be no peace in the region until Jesus returns !!!<br>Israel has a right to defend their country and their people through military retaliation and deliver swift justice to the Hamas Terrorist Groups.<br>No military intervention from the USA.
Israel is illegal
"Yes such chilling completely blurred images. Good god, stop protecting the perpetrators by covering the real horror. It only allows people to humanize these terrorists."
They arrested 2Pacs killer (allegedly).
The reporter looks sick.
I believe Israel can return back a heavy heavy and Palestinian is a done deal for in the planet that&#39;s I believe
Israel who teror palestinian citizen
"Biden, having Israel&#39;s back must be seen. I believe it&#39;s lip service."
Obama seems very quiet after all the money he sent to Iran. I am sure Iran had a hand in this. What do you think Obama?
That one guy hiding behind a car before being executed… that’s the reality of this terrorist people. Show this difference between the states involved how this conflict is being conducted. You want to silence the terrorists supporters? Show them those types of videos. Show them how casual murder is to these “people”.
"While I&#39;m against civilian attacks, imagine for a moment, many Amerindians came to the US after World War 2, and ask for their piece of lands, and took a State sized land and built a Nation with old names of their nation.<br><br>How would Americans react to that? Probably this group of Amerindians would ceased to exist."
We do not negotiate with terrorists.
"Terrorist statw of israel has gone against humanity killing women, men and 146 children so far. They cut off food, electricity and all supplies. May god punish you. Kidnapping is not killing like the Israelites are killing Palestinians."
This is not retaliation this is defending your people. This is so heartbreaking.
Hitler is with you Israel
My prayers for the people in Israel from New York USA 🙏🙏
Like every 3 year they fight
"Can&#39;t demand nothing in another country, u can ask but cant blame this on Biden if it goes bad. Dont show pics of American citizens.   Dont want ur enemies to know their Americans"
"You should have escaped the Gaza Strip years ago. Living there now, you&#39;re just lame, and Hamas turned you into a sitting duck."
This is unexpected it’s no one’s fault but we will stand with Israel
"Well... I too feel bad for those innocent Israeli families and some of those Americans who were dragged in this war. But what exactly Hamas is doing is not exactly terrorism but an act of vengeance. They have been through all of this but were never got this much support, because they were the only one suffering. <br>Now that some American families are suffering the affects of war everyone forgets why Hamas is doing this."
6 billion that biting gave them and lifting the sanctions gave him 34 more billion
I wonder if Hamas is puzzled that they are now being barbecued ?
Don&#39;t send our black kids to help them and you we not help us in the USA
My prayers for Israel
"Looks like the bewilderment  of 1972 Munich Olympics ordeal has been repeated, some may even remember the Venezuelan Carlos The Jackal, Black September and other fringe &quot;terrorists&#39;&quot; exploits of the 1970s. One goal Hamas has repeatedly mimicked, is staging similar stunts aiming for the capturing of the world&#39;s sympathies after recurring heavy handed Israeli military punishment meant as a future deterrence but has never eradicated Hamas&#39; motivations in stirring the fiery bees nests inciting the blossoming fury in display. <br>The intensity of the Israeli bombings reminds of &quot;The Christmas Bombings&quot; administered by American B52s on Hanoi, Haiphong etc., meant to instigate Vietnam&#39;s Le Duc Tho back to the negotiation table with Kissinger and it did. Maybe history will repeat itself again."
The US needs to put boots on the ground and take these dumb clowns out!!!
"the real Terrorist of all the times is Israel. Israel was created artificially and  ilegally in 1947 by Great Britain and the USA. Its not even a State. It has not defined borders,  it has not a Constitution. etc,,"
Where&#39;s the current body count from Ukraine ? Where&#39;s the 2000 missing kids in Maui ? National news is a joke. How&#39;s that 6 bil. they sent Iran a few weeks ago looking now ?
How come you sit comfortably in your home and demands someone else to do your job? You should get up and fly over to rescue your mom. Every soldier lives also have love ones at home for their return.
Tell the administration you have Brittney Griner with you. The administration will rescue you tomorrow.
"I know this is not going to help Israel, but it’s not going to help us either."
As you can see right here is the true face of muslims killing unarmed innocent people.
I sincerely doubt that the captives will be returned alive.  These savages had no problem decapitating infants and murdering their parents right next to them.  Plus hundreds of innocent people attending aconcert.  Compassion is not in their vocabulary....
Armageddon it!!!!<br>Make unconditional surrender great again!!!!
Those Million Chinese Men Biden let cross our borders can do the same here. Stay vigilant.
"Yeah, cause it only takes 5 mins to retaliate and get everyone back and safe… get a grip"
"The big question you have to ask, how much is truth how much is fabricated."
"Israel which says they are unlike Hamas are now bombing civilians in Gaza that have nothing to do with this, how does that prove your moral superiority. All Israel is doing is commiting as many war crimes and atrocities as Hamas. Which will create more people seeking revenge in Gaza, and also endangering the lives of the hostages."
My brothers and sisters 😢 😢
I don&#39;t there is anything Biden can do....
80% of the world population support Palestinians struggle to free themselves against Israeli occupation ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Biden paid for this a month ago to iran
Good report!
"isreal is corrupt, why is there no talk about all the control, pain, and evil they have done to the palestines?"
Free Palestine!
This will be a lessons to israel to experience what Palestine was experiencing everyday since 1948
There will be no peace until the PRINCE of Peace returns to HIS throne! Even so come LORD JESUS 🩸 ☝️ 🙏 ✝️ 🗡 👑
NBC incapable of calling out IDF for their war crimes.
Israel level Gaza &amp; all within it
"If hamas have massacred anyone they see, then there are little hopes for the ones who are held hostage."
That news anchor looks like he&#39;s gonna kick the bucket.😮
🖕🖕🖕Shout out to every Democrat here in the States that supports HAMAS/Palestine.
The number of dead in gaza has to be higher than 900 after all those strikes...
😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Biden and the Democrat are responsible for this.
Pray God is our only hope…. How foolish asking aGodless government to save them!!!!
How Hamas sending rockets even after these barrage of air raids from isreal
People get tired of being treated like trash and seeing their siblings slaughtered for generations what do you expect. Israel needs a new prime minister to end this hate war being called a terrorist war
Now get those anti Israel dumbasses out of our congress!!!
"Just as a side note, how&#39;s the strict gun control laws in Isreal  working out for you now?"
this is the fault of the democtatic administration funding iran and hammas with over 6 billion dollars a month ago
"So its retaliation if Israel kills Palestinians, but its terror when Hamas kills Israelis. Being in an open prison is such a great life, what would Hamas have to retaliate for?"
These wars never would have happened if we still had a strong president
Biden and the dimrats are done for!
Stop occuping palastine land then. maybe then this wont happen
Remember how Israel used to treat wounded Isis fighters in Syria?
Turn over every stone!
"This guy demanding, 1st, Americans know their suseptible to acts of terrorism when they leave America!"
ᓇᖏᖃᑎᒋᕙᕋ ᐃᔅᕆᐊᓪ
What about the terror from Israel on Palestine  everyday???
"I am so very sorry for the hostages and their families and loved ones, BUT they have been taken by a terrorist group and the reality of this horrible act is there was never a plan to release them alive.  That&#39;s not how terrorists operate.  I am so very sorry and continue to pray for their release, but evil shows no mercy and make no mistakes, HAMAS is pure evil.  😢😢💔💔"
How can you have Isreal back when you don&#39;t have America&#39;s  back....
Killing innocent civilians is not justified not matter the reason. Israel must stop the killings of civilians immediately.
Thank you for the fair coverage !
POTUS should have told Hamas they have 24 hours to release American hostages or else the U.S. steps in with attacks  from the carrier task force.
hamas is isis.. their goal is to bring deaths regardless of palestines or israelites.. menace of humanity.. they the real djinns of the world.. if killing gentiles is what they call &quot;retaliation for the jews&quot; then palestines must be extinct using same logic
you need to stop showing the footage of them killing people! that&#39;s what they want! pathetic media coverage!
BLM still around? WHY ⁉️🤣
nothing worse than POTUS talking like a 14 year old &quot;we have Israel&#39;s back&quot;. Whoever wrote that stupidity should be fired. Talk in an intelligent and respectful manner to the world stage.
War machine propaganda
EVERYONE FORGOT ALL ABOUT UKRAINE   HUH 🤔 NOW ISRAEL  🤔 HUH BOTH RUN BY 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🫡🫡
"After the news about decapitated Israeli toddlers , I lost total faith in the Palestinian people."
"My prayers go to the IDF. My message for Israel, show no mercy for you will receive none."
"Cutting off food, water and electricity for 2.2 million people is inhumane. Not letting women and children  and eldery leave Gaza before bombs going off is INHUMANE."
مرتك سوف تعود لربما بعد تسعة أشهر حامل في بيبي حمساوي <br>Good luck 😂
"Being cutoff from any ability to resupply, Hamas is basically on a suicide mission at this point."
"Hamas’ positions? Like apartment buildings full of children? Genocide, Zionist genocide.."
LORD HAVE MERCY&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
Not Biden administrations fault..YOU WANTED TO BE THERE!!!!!
"Thanks for the 6 billion $$$ and 85b $$ in  Afghan weapons, suckers !!!!"

Would these countries reciprocate if the US need aid like in Ukraine and now Israel. ?

This &#39;righteous sl*ughter&#39; is brought to you by militants of the religion of Peace. They will all be rewarded in heaven by their bloodthirsty deity with virgins of course.
"I&#39;d bet with our relations with Israel, Delta or Seals are there looking to free Americans"
Israelis Are killing civilians
"Palestine needs to be erased off the earth … Israel is the one true nation … My heavenly father has been there, and his soul is still there… Pray for Israel ……."
The hostages are already gone. End hamas
"In the same manner that Isreal has the right to retaliate for the mass murders of their people, So! should we the people have that same right to retaliate towards people who would do us harm in the street, our homes, or to our family and or others that are abused by criminals. Israel is not waiting for someone else to come and do their Justice and Neither should we. Stay ARMED and train and always be prepared to Defend what is to Defend."
Thousands of virgins are bring prepared in paradise.
Media happy they have content finally
2 milliards muslims with palestine
It’s no coincidence this happened just a few months after Biden gave Iran billions of dollars
The United States not declaring war when American citizens were mustered and taken hostage is a sign of weakness that puts this country at risk.
1000% Joe Biden&#39;s fault.
vitnem with palestine<br>spain with palestine
Apparently the Palestinians (i.e. Hamas) have decided either the Israelis will all die or they will.<br><br>And how brave of our deficient president to take two days to have a statement.
"Israel has the support of all Americans to bulldoze Gaza, pave it, and turn it into a parking lot."
"<b>israelis have been massacring Palestinians, killing children, and even burning them to death for over SEVENTY FIVE (75) YEARS.</b>"
R.i.p. Hammas
Hamas is terrorist organizations
england with palestine
china with palestine
America has ALREADY BEEN INVADED from the South !!! Prepare Americans PREPARE!!
Those who laugh at the resistance are tough men. The resistance is the residents of Gaza and the residents of Gaza are the resistance. They want their land that was stolen from them. Honorable people defend their land and their dignity. You should be ashamed of your laughter because you do not know the meaning of manhood.
Biden Administration gave Iran 6 billion who inturn funded Hamas....  Biden Administration played a major role in ALL OF THIS TERROR!
عليك اللعنه ايها الحمق بايدن <br>انتم راعين السلام وليس طرفا في الحرب على غزه

I am so glad Biden is pledging support from his personal wealth to Israel.
brasil with palestine
Hey someone let rep Omar know that &quot;some people did something&quot; again
I would like to express my deepest condolences for the loss of loved ones and the departed family.  May the holy spirit come and take the pure soul up to the highest heaven.  And may God protect everyone from this war and terrorists.
PEOPLE ARE KILLED IN US  EVERYDAY CHILDREN WOMEN@ CHILDREN ALL OVER THE WORLD PEOPLE ARE DYING ISRAEL ISNT SPECIAL
God bless Israel🇮🇱
Told you Biden poops his pants. He must step down. And right into prison. Or we are doomed.
"All these American mainstream media outlets will never show a non-biased version of the story. Lots of innocent civilians have been affected in Gaza, but you won&#39;t hear about that from the mainstream media. What a disgrace."
No. Nothing biden can. Do. What is done is done  escalations of threats. Their is no proof they are alive. The captures are animals!!!! They wont let anyone live. My heart for the loss. Let 🇮🇱  flatten gaza. End the terrorism and manipulation.
عن جد أن مش امصدق إلى بصير
🇵🇸 Freedom for Palestine 🇵🇸
Imagine you live in NY and have voted for a congresswoman that goes to DC and then when Israel is attacked by Hamas that person you voted for cheered for the Hamas group. How in the world is this AOC person still in DC!!!!
Wow.  NBC condemning this terror attack?!?!  Nice.  Progress!
And the media and weapons manufacturers make😢 money<br>INNOCENTS on both sides die.
🕊️🇮🇱🇵🇸🤝
We all need to pray for Israel
"I wish the media would be more willing to show atrocities, rather than sanitize them with blurring.   Be it what&#39;s going on in Israel, or when there are mass shootings in the US, I think it&#39;s important that people see reality."
I give NBC credit for showing real footage!
"Israelis need world support and they have Nuclear Weapons the latest technologies and $4 Billion dollars annually ($270 Billion) in USA welfare. <br><br>Why would the Palestinians have to resort to these action? Because 75 years ago they were INVADED by colonial Europeans who 16 years ago set up a brutal Apartheid System AND THE ISRAELIS HAVE BEEN KILLING MEN WOMEN CHILDREN ever since.  <br><br>I AM ASHAMED OF THE NEWS MEDIA, OUR POLITICIANS AND MOST OF ALL THE AMERICAN SHEEPLE. <br><br>THE REAL TERRORIST LIVE ON EVERY CONTINENT ON STOLEN LAND AND IS CONFEDERATE"
I thought Islam was the religion of peace.
"As horrible as it is I think the poor hostages were probably killed not long after they were taken . I don&#39;t feel anything for the people in the Gaza strip , the Hamas decided to attack innocent civilians at a concert because it was easy  , but by doing so they have made the world hate them no matter what they were fighting for . That is an act of a coward nothing else . this conflict has been going on for too long , time to end it for good ."
This is not acceptable on any side! Please help them
Biden will pay ransom like he did too Iran
I wouldn&#39;t blame Israel if they leveled the gaza strip.
Free Palestine! 🇵🇸
Blame the British and the UN for dividing Israel into a jigsaw.
thousands of Americans have been effected by this
This is what happens when you pay $6billion for hostages.
"Yes, so the Israeli MOSSAD proxy group of bad actors are serving their purpose to fool the people of the world into to perceiving Israel as a victim, as they have done since the beginning. Fewer and fewer people are buying their charade."
"Everyone is saying Biden Biden but Trump killed an Iranian leader , they don’t care about Americans"
Honestly I think both sides are terrorist
American got to help them. Help them. Stop the hate
Help these people. I don’t care about Hamas or Israel government. They don’t know where to go. Israeli or Palestinian please help them!
Praying for all victims
"Lots of video from Israel, but not from Ukraine. Here comes more money supporting a war that is not our problem"
this isn&#39;t retaliation. Palestinians are not Hamas
"Yes, let&#39;s give up our firearms in the US - In Israel today the Army is running around the city handing out guns so people can defend themselves."
اللعنه على اليهود
The USA dont negotiated with terrorists
"how accurate is that statement at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6G6MWe6IQ&amp;t=2m15s"">2:15</a> ? coz biden always lie"
calling Hamas Animals is not going to help his situation.
Since Iran is behind this unspeakable act of war the World must get together against Hamas and Iran!  It is just heartbreaking to watch!
This is all preventable killing the innocent all human created this is just tragic
What Israel is to to Gazas civilians Is 💯 war Crimes. Carpet bombs &amp; phosphorus bombs on civilians! Shutting water supplies &amp; Electric. Razing their cities even tho they know Hamas is under ground! This is intentional wars crimes! So they can steal more land!
Don&#39;t play as victim now. We know your style of phychological wars to gain public concerns &amp;  justify your barbaric bombings
The U.S. wants a foothold in the Middle East at any cost. It doesn’t matter how many Palestinians are disenfranchised and killed. Yet another reason to be ashamed to be an American. This country is a disgrace!
"<b>The hypocrisy of western media: Hamas&#39; self-defense and resistance are labeled terror attacks, while the zionist occupation (so-called israel) terror attacks are labeled self-defense and right of defense. These are some of the atrocities committed by the occupation known as israel:</b><br><br>• Many massacres of the Palestinians<br><br>• Snipers shooting unarmed Palestinians<br><br>• Killing more than 2300 Palestinian children from 2000 - present, amongst them 4 months old Iman Hajo and 12 years old Muhammad Al-Durrah.<br><br>• Burning to death Palestinian children such as 18 months old Ali Saad Dawabsha and 16 years old Mohammed Abu Khdeir<br><br>• Many war crimes, such as the use of white phosphorus bombs and human shields.<br><br>• Intentional killing of Palestinians in order to harvest their organs<br><br>• Turning the Gaza Strip into an open air prison, as well as fragmenting and paralyzing the West Bank"
There&#39;s not a lot the POTUS-46 can do in the short term and the US Embassy in Israel is quite overloaded with calls for help.
Good luck getting help from the dumb dems
How come Armenia didnt het this level of coverage. Its a Catholic country.
Did Lester give blood?
Every &quot;journalist&quot; at NBC will be held accountable for your lies when the war comes to home. Free Palestine. America stands with them not Israeli Zionists mass murderers.
The picture of Palestine really speaks for itself...
"Biden is a traitor he created the problem. He supported Iran with 6 billion dollars that was used by hamas traitor. Democraps are all traitors and blood is in there hands. Those babies blood is on all Democraps and woke, liberals,  communist and socialist traitors."
There are no innocent Palestinians.
"Very sad 😭😭😭, it Jesus country. Very horrible. The war killing so much people. Very horrible what happened to the people. God will be with you"
Prayers for Israel. 🙏🙏🙏🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱.  May terrorists 🗑️ Hamas&#39; heinous acts be returned upon them. With interest. 🗑️
I have a feeling the Gaza strip is about to become as flat as a landing strip.
All the bombs israel strikes on Palestine isn&#39;t barbaric or wrong huh? Just when they respond back against Israel is wrong....
Get them Israel terarist governments b
الله اكبر
"You paid 6 Billion dollars to Iran for American hostages. And Iran paid Hamas to hold Jews, hostage, and bargain. Now Bla...bla..."
All this proves that ISLAM has never ou will ever be a religion of peace but a group of haters and killers
"Help these people. Please my government, help these plea pls on both sides!!"
Idiots left all that military equipment in Afghanistan and now they’re brutally killing everyone in sight. Sick
Only reason why Hamas kills civilians is because they can&#39;t fight in a real war. They know they will lose. That makes them cowards!
Media has no idea how many Americans are dead or missing first they said 9 now we are at 14 as Americans we need to join Israel’s side for world peace!🇮🇱🩷🌎👍🏻✌🏻
this is what happens when you are a terrorist. your home of gaza becomes ruins. what did you think would happen???
"Yeah ok like the hostages will be rescued by a seal team based on an air craft carrier. Uh huh. By the way, with all the money America gives them Israel should be able to defend their country. So why do we have to send our Navy?. It’s a joke."
At least he went there for a photo op
Notice: They will never call out for God They know not to even play with God and mention him at this moment in time. I bet cha.
Ask why is this happening? if you want to solve this issue.
Israel DONT play!!! I support Israel 🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱  So ashamed we have Biden at the helm right now!! Biden caused this!!!!
Only the innocents pay the heavy prices with their lives and blood
Radical muslims take advantage of morality by modern world. Meanwhile conduct themselves with nothing but hate and bloodlust. Lacking any humanity. Cancer upon modern society.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6G6MWe6IQ&amp;t=3m55s"">3:55</a>"
Don&#39;t Americans feel so proud and safe with their fearless leader
The propaganda is real...🤦🏾‍♂️
I am angry! I don’t support Hams but these people are separate from Hamas.Palestinians are separate from Hamas.
Freedom of speech is the time you lisson and actually learn
"Did Biden just point at his nose after talking about kids and stuff?  Come on man, we know you wanted a sniff, but keep it in yer pants for a while. But thank god the master negotiator is on the case!  LOL"
We all know how much &quot;responsibility&quot; Joe Biden takes when things go badly.
He said dooty
Palestine is no more
americans zionists jews are terrorists. Palestine state will be established . we are the winners on this life and in the hereafter
"Thank you, Lester Holt, for revealing some of the horror of war, and the massacre of Jews in Israel. You have done so much better than PBS Newshour, which shamefully does not even use the word &quot;terrorism&quot;. At least you showed some of the killing, what is happening. There is so much anti-semitism everywhere."
What does “support” mean?
This is the culmination of democrat&#39;s efforts
"This attack on Israel is so suspicious, a nation that prides itself on being on the cutting edge of technology, being caught of guard, makes no sense 🤔, could it be a false flag attack coordinate by Israel and the USA GOVERNMENT, to killed two birds with one stone, staged one lets purged the Gaza strip, 2 staged lets go after Iran"
No civilian is being killed in Gazza? Only israili civilians? Why no body talks about Palestinian civilians
"Series barbaric bombings on Gaza by terro state of Israel, mass killing Palestinian civilians right in their homeland &amp; abroad. This is not the first time."
The media loves events like this!
"Unintentionally Hamas has created their own extinction level event.  They will live on in history books, but as of now, Hamas is an endangered species."
"Sometimes Biden actually appears to be a competent, capable leader.  Given all the other times, I am always surprised.  But, good going, Joe!  We are behind you on this.  Do the right thing!"
Lester you still suc
Creator of terrorist calling others terrorist. How funny!
"America is sending warships to Israel, with asking American Public. Also is sending American Money without asking the American Public."
Do you think the Palestinians are concered about a Covid-19 outbreak now?
Biden will rescue Brittany Greiner. Not American hostages.
"Saddam never had a WMD IN IRAQ , but ISRAEL HAVE it All , and using it ,  and the world stand blind and silence"
Is Israel  killing innocent Palestinians?
Religion caused this
"don&#39;t be a fool there as good as gone and is-real knows this. They just need to end this 1,000 year  war once a for all and turn that wasteland into shiny glass."
Ukraine trying to get back their land: Heroic<br>Palestinians trying to get it back : terror attack.<br>U fking double standard m0ro0ns.
Prayers going up. I know not all Palestinians are terrorists and this must be horrible for them as well. These terrorists are so evil they cross the line on both sides. This has got to stop!
"When you go to that part of the world, ur taking ur life into your own hands, America cant really start Armageddon for those that are captured"
The Israelis committing genocide is nothing new
Biden and Harris &quot;has Israel&#39;s back&quot;? I&#39;m sure that really comforts the Israeli people when the Biden Administration totally fails to protects its own borders.
Hahaha
😂😂😂😂. This people are as sick as they can come. That reporter isn’t he ashamed ?
"You evil government,   the Ukraine occupation is unacceptable from the first day,  the whole world  have benn supporting  it.<br>But Palestine occupation is Acceptable for 75  years"
Isreal needs to stop stealing land
And know ghaza is being bombarded relentless
"hamas wants all isrealis to die, so what kind of settlement is worth having? the no hamas deal sounds best."
Biden is the weakest president America has ever had!!! Trump 2024!
Human rights violations are rampant. So much pain and needless hatred.
"The sad thing is, where do you go from here other then complete destruction of Gaza."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6G6MWe6IQ&amp;t=3m05s"">3:05</a> sorry your mom is dead already"
"This not war by Hamas…this was something else…besides attacking Israel, the crimes committed against Israeli civilians…they need to fkng pay"
Israel will come out the winner. The world will make sure of that. We support you Israel.
"Moral equivalency, Anyone?"
They are not animals they fighting for the same reason yall fighting for land always land
Need to give a credit to nbc for this report    Not a big fan of this network.
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23america"">#America</a> first ! . We can’t afford someone else’s war especially when we aren’t middle eastern . <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23no"">#No</a> funding for mar wars at this time"
"Every time such events happen, something else is taking place elsewhere in the shadows."
"Israel is more than capable to level Gaza, yet there are many innocent Palestinians and Israeli hostages so they are cautious. But if Israel gets pushed to its&#39; limits and hostages are executed, Gaza is guaranteed to be a waste land."
"Muslims everywhere glossing over or justifying these actions are sick. They are no less biased, hateful, bigoted than the extremist Jews they claim to hate."
I think Israeli retaliation has barely begun. Someone...likely a great number of someones...in high places..not in Gaza...are going to pay a damned high price. And...no mercy toward them.
😢😢😢
"Israel is putting they own citizens into this, the people in leadership is not victims AT ALL."
วันไซ้เด็ดรีพอด
"Thank the lying, corrupt British and French after WWI for starting all of this."
America first.. not out problem… same with Ukraine and all the countries we help..  not the 50 states. I don’t care
Sick and tired of radical muslims. If they want war. Lets give them war.
Joe Biden has helped fund this attack with his foreign policies with Iran
"Why nbc dont shows the face of the criminal murderer of Hamas, he turns his head, after he killed the one behind the car . Israel can identifie him , also the viewers in all the world."
I bet Israel wishes they had a second amendment.
The very news network that has belittled ISRAEL in the past is now cowering in ratings to stay alive.
Israel has the right to respond and a duty to defend. The entire Gaza must be cleared clean.
Just like January 6. Almost identical. Can’t tell the difference
STAND WITH ISRAEL✊ STAND WITH UKRAINE✊
muslim COWARDS
These MALE Dominated RELIGIONS 🧑‍⚕️Christian/ Jewish /Muslim are disgusting! I have always admired the Iroquois tribe!

The Genocide supported by the US has been going on for seventy five years. Joe Biden is guilty of crimes against humanity for supporting the genocide.
Obama Biden Creep ?
Israel was founded with multiple acts of terrorism.  Research &quot;the Stern Gang&quot;.  Hamas was founded by the Mossad to bypass the PLO. Their chief purpose is to provide token resistance and a pretext for the Israelis to continue their indiscriminate slaughter of the Palestinian people.
Free Palestine &lt;3
Israel has been doing this for 60 years to the Palestinians!
This is only the beginning.
Hostages can only be rescued through a top secret special forces operation complemented by mossad
"With a little more effort, Gaza will get the title of the world’s largest parking lot"
"Biden is not responsible for the hostages. Everyone is aware of the unrest between them and visiting is not safe. It&#39;s not as if they were focused on for being American. This is not a political war , let&#39;s be honest.<br>God bless everyone and I pray this not as long as I suspect"
"Just don’t deprive Israel of help in such crucial time, LIKE YOU DID WITH UKRAINE! (“Ukraine won’t last so we won’t bother sending any support”)"
Hamas started it….Israel will finish this off for sure.
"Well considering Biden gave Iran 6 billion dollars, it’s good to know they are putting it to good use"
Israel should level Gaza and start over with that being there land permanently.
Hamas will become HUMMUS by this Weekend
That part of the world has been cursed since 1917
"If 45 gave putin Israel’s defense secrets, passed to hamas...death penalty at least..traitor"
😢😢😢
"All in a day&#39;s work for human history. A century from now, this will be another insignificant story in a child&#39;s text book."
"If you support Hamas, you are also a terrorist."
"Islam needs to go, at least the extremist side of the religion that makes people think they are justified in killing babies."
More like targeting massive massive apartment buildings
Where are the Arabs leaders?
Mr. Pm Netanyahu knows that all of we all people know that he will not be keeping his promise to his people if he doesn&#39;t send in the ground troops cause just bombing above surface isnt doing nothing cause we all know the main leaders of hamas is below ground and we all know it their like scared weasels cause we all know all leaders around the world hide below ground like a bunch of scared weasels.
I&#39;ve seen more atrocity of war in this 7min clip than all of the news reports on the Ukraine.

"At times like this, I really want to escape Youtube -,-&#39;"
This is all about USA 🇺🇸 nothing happened around the world if USA doesn’t order to happen
One sided what about the 2.3 million innocent people under bobmberment
Biden so stupid still support Israel
military industrial complex&#39;s shareholders are rubbing their hands intensely...
"To all the palestinian supporters, i hope you never get to live the massacre that you so proudly celebrate. Long Live Israel!"
"Biden Administration  or just Joe does planty , he alredy coused two major wars ,lets see what else he will achieve"
"Radical islamic Terrorism must be stopped. They cut the heads off babies. Maybe Tlaib and AOC and the rest of the squad would stop supporting terrorist&#39;s if their friends had their heads cut off? How can they support people who cut off the heads of women and babies. Sick, sick sick. And people voted for the squad, how sick."
Don’t say ISRAEL Targeting HAMAS<br><br>Simply say <br><br>ISRAEL targeting civilians <br>Because thats what we see
Hey NBC why don&#39;t you ask Biden where Hamas got the US weapons they are using? Afghanistan half assed withdraw where they got left behind. So the liar pledges support what is he suppose to do when trying to save face?
God blessing all of Israel
Palestinians demanding land and retribution is like native Americans demanding half the country. Never gonna happen.
Time for the Gaza Peoples to IDENTIFY and INFORM Israel where and when these HAHAmas &quot;leaders&quot; are hiding or running!!!
Yeah I don&#39;t trust Western media.
Terror attack?? Do you meant Israel?
Any white american who wants to be under false pretenses that&#39;s his choice
I went bow hunting for the first time ever.
My tummy hurts from watching this 😭😭😭 love to everyone in this praying for everyone 💞
The last days are here! Pray 🙏 🤲🏻  God is on his way! Jesus walked through Isreal b4 he was crucified. This is Real Spiritual Warefare! Mexico 🇲🇽 has nothing to do with us. Please release my people!
Can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this but thank Biden for standing with isreal
"Fake, like covid"
Some Christian outside Israel are willing to give blood too
C&#39;mon NBC interview Ilhan Omar
Since when  resisting apartheid and settlements  and colonising became terrorism.  This word terrorism became so subjective
"all religions are evil, I HOPE for the  worst for all these subhuman monsters.."
Thanks Joe
"Isaiah 17:1 Damascus will be no more. I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word (Jesus) and believes Him who sent Me (God) has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life. John 5:24 Jesus died for you, all you have to do is believe &amp; repent."
American stand with satan Israel
"The only problem why this conflict never get solved, Because the world see one side of the story. Civilians  killed by rockets or by dropping bombs by F16 does not make any different one called Terror the other one self defense. If you are on the side Israel you see the rockets as terror and Bombs as self defense, If you are on the Palestinian side you see the opposite.....<br>Let&#39;s pray for all Civilians specially the children on both sides......."
Huck Famas
"they are two vipers biting each other, let them understand each other or destroy themselves alone."
Palestinians didn&#39;t even have their own state. No government. Just nomads who happened to be near by when Israel was established after ww2.
OH!  It pleased me when the MILITARY SUPPLIES building was BLOWN UP in Gaza and the SECONDARY EXPLOSIONS were videotaped while the supplies was recorded going up in a BOOM.  It does not matter that the muslems there CALLED the supply building a &quot;mosque&quot;!
America Loves and Supports Israel 🇮🇱 .
"Im so anti war, but if someone was invading my territory.... I couldn&#39;t imagine NOT standing with my brothers and sisters. <br>Prayers to all. ❤ Pray for ☮️"
Religion sucks!
"Israeli servicemen failed to hide their crime:  First, the video shows the dead bodies of four Palestinian militants lying with weapons. However, the footage shared by the Israeli military reveals that the militants were shot after they surrendered. Moreover, the footage from the drone confirmed that the victims were not armed, and Israeli servicemen later put weapons next to the bodies, apparently in an attempt to hide their war crime and declare a descent victory."
Bring out the popcorn!!!
Lets see how fast the narrative changes and we only see Palestinian victims.
"In retaliation Israel has  cut off the FOOD, FUEL and WATER for the 2.3 MILLION people now imprisoned in crowded Gaza.   Israel is bombing  everything to rubble. There  is going to be a huge MASSACRE of Palestinian CIVILIANS who had nothing to do with this. Think about that: 2.3 MILLION  people stuck  without FOOD , FUEL AND ESPECIALLY WATER , and they can&#39;t get out !   UNICEF has estimated that there are roughly 1 million children living in the Gaza Strip, meaning that almost HALF the people in Gaza are children. Almost 40 percent of the population is under the age of 15."
Won&#39;t take long before democrats and the media turn against Israel again
The reporter didn&#39;t even donate<br>Americans are so full of crap
Hamas&#39;s unprecedented attack on Israel….they have opened Pandora&#39;s box…
Stand with Palestinian 💪😔
I am more sad and angry with the world than I am with those monsters. Absolutely horrific the fact people think of “both” sides. Go educate yourselves this is worst than hitler

"Nows the time to call in work, but my supervisor would still give me pts 😅 gaza is that tiny of a city and wanna start war..."
A good President would have been demanding Americans be released and retaliating for those killed. Biden get out just leave.
"We stand with plastine.  We stand with truth, human dignity, and sovereignty  of a  nation. We are against zionism,  facism and the cloniser israel."
"Actually very impressed with NBC news coverage here, thank you."
Hamas has forced this.
What do unites States and the Israel expect from the Palestinian? When they have placed them  to live a life in misery
"Over 1,000,000 Gaza residents are under the age of 15. No reports of Israel being discriminate in their attacks. <br><br>Is bombing children sill a war crime?"
So are we looking at a four-year wait before anything is done to him like every Communist MAGA republican?
"Iran, Qatar will shelter you Palestinians.  Go there. Palestinians have proved that reconciliation is impossible.  Too toxic of a relationship. Move on. It&#39;s a divorce. And Israel is keeping the house."
"How can Hamas that can&#39;t even afford food manage to buy and launch thousands of missiles at $50,000 a shot?  Who&#39;s funding Hamas?!!"
Biden is a hopeless president can&#39;t do much.....
"And to think 🤔 😏 all Palestinians had to do to avoid any of this 🤨 was to not be savage murdering religious lunatics<br><br>Seriously, they Only had One 🤷‍♂️ fuk&#39;n job"
Good reporting!
"Hamas... Proving their god is a weak,petty, loser"
"They keep calling for Holy War, it is time to grant their wish. Mecca would look much better under a mushroom cloud, followed by every city in the enemy camp."
Is this happening exactly as Democrats wanted to happen or have they lost control of a situation that they initiated?  <br><br> BS when they said that they had absolutely zero intelligence that this was coming down. The CIA has everything in the world wired.<br><br>Neither the Ukraine war nor this war in the Middle East would have happened if Trump was president. Not because Trump is good or has superpowers.... but it was not in his agenda.<br><br>Moreover the people that vote for Democrats made this happen. Anything for their party keep keep control. A matter of time before the open borders bring War into the United States too.<br><br>My guess is that an attempt to further drive up the price of oil got out of somebody&#39;s control. It&#39;s a tragedy that innocent people die and suffer so others can maintain power and make money.<br><br>Voting for Democrats has  consequences.
"One culture is that of Civilised Educated and highly intellectual quotient !! <br>Other Culture is backward , violent and Stone age one !! <br><br>Support the forward looking culture only that way these things can end !!"
Israel is a terror
"If we had a Bush in office, we wouldn&#39;t be using the term &quot;hostage&quot; we&#39;d be talking Prisoners of War, which is what they are.  They were taken prisoner in an act of war, a war which was legally declared by a sovereign state.  Holding a US citizen as a POW is in fact a declaration of war and should be responded to as such.  And I&#39;m a liberal!"
"the way we back Israel, you would think the US is a jewish country"
Islam is cancer.
Lord father up in the heavens I pray you release these hostages from the dirty nasty grip of those animals !!! Lord hear my prayer 🙏🏻 in Jesus mighty name I pray!!!! 😞🙌🏼💪🏻🙏🏻😥
"Sorry to ask, but I’ve seen some people compare Palestinians to Germans in WW2, so what did Palestinians do prior that was so horrible?"
"According to the UN General Assembly Resolution 37/43 adopted in 1982, the UN recognizes any struggle, including armed struggle, made by people under occupation and oppression.<br><br>So, technically, the attack made by Hamas is a “legal” attack and not an act of terrorism.<br><br>I am neutral, just reiterating the UNGA Resolution that may be overlooked by the world."
Biden started  it.
How masochistic you have to be to capture even people of other countries that can literally lose your mind and delete you from existence.
May JESUS be The SAVIOR for ALL Humanity SOON❤
May the Most High have mercy and protect all the oppressed people of the world.
"&quot;Israel intensifies retaliation...??&quot;<br> For corn sakes&#39;, NBC. Keep up. Retaliation is bulldozing a few homes. Israel has declared WAR!"
Notice NOBODY talking about Ukraine anymore 🤡 Just another place for Biden to launder his money
Lol &quot;retaliation&quot;. Classic western framing.
And some countries in this world are supporting the abductors ??? That tells a lot about their stone age practices.
Is this poor man a Israeli citizen?
Israel is just cleaning up the trash that liberal love and support.
Fake news
Winder why the lame stream media isn&#39;t in Ukraine?  We never see live images or reporting from the so called war that Ukraine is supposedly winning at the expense of US taxpayers.
"No sympathy for Hamas.  I feel disgust and anger against 0bama, Biden and the democrats who funded these atrocities.  Since 2016, again and again, they sent Billions of dollars to Iran who funds Hamas."
And people&#39;s still supporting those terrorists
Hey NBC you are not being fair and justice to the conflict - were the Palestine&#39;s side of the story are they not human?
It is not &quot;retaliation&quot; in a &quot;cycle of violence.  It is warfare to fight people who would like to eliminate Jews.
Glad to see media refer to Hamas as terrorists. I STAND WITH ISRAEL✡
I have no mercy toward evil!
The US Gov should just remain silent. Marching Biden out does not instill confidence to Anyone
USA flys get them back so easy lol very easy
Biden will turn on Israel. He has no backbone.
Didn’t biden bathe with his 12 year old daughter?<br><br>That’s some hamas level behavior
"They said that Palestinians has nothing to do with HAMAS atrocities, but they were rejoicing after the terrorist HAMAS attacked the music festival that killed hundreds of innocent people. They even welcome these extremists in Gaza when they paraded their hostages in the streets."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6G6MWe6IQ&amp;t=2m35s"">2:35</a> Look at Kamala back there trying to figure out how she even got the job."
This is so sad and tragic... So many innocent people involved in such horrific act😢 prayers to all the innocent people involved. 😢
It is incredible to imagine Israel finding itself in this vulnerable position despite it&#39;s reputation as &quot;having the best intelligence and military&quot;. What is the point building a multi-million dollar wall without electronic monitoring system that can warn of any approaching intruders. This has changed my perception of Israeli military reputation. I hope I am wrong because I love Israel a great deal.
Israel can’t win an urban warfare battle. Going to be a meat grinder. Think Fallujah many multiple times worse.
"O something, everybody has a moral obligation to do so.  STAND UP, call your embassies and find out what you can do."
Maybe we should take the responsibility for electing a man the whole world is paying the price for.
"I pray for Israel, and the Americans."
Wishing the Palestinians success in their war of freedom. Phailistín Go Bragh brothers.
Killing each other for centuries... nothing new... wisdom doesn&#39;t exist... humility doesn&#39;t exist... Beliefs doesn&#39;t... Animal instinct Exist
Wow ...those Palestinian land stolen by Israel and being fence up l...totally like prisinors are call terrorists....😅..wheres the logic ....100%believes Israel is the terrorists not Palestine.
Stop commiting genocide against Palestinians.
Just talk it over u fools war will just create a millions or orphans bent on revenge
Terror attack??? It&#39;s a war baby two countries are fighting
They been fighting for 100s of years. Against each s other.. what&#39;s new.....
"My heart breaks more and more as more innocent lives are taken due people that don&#39;t have any compassion for HUMANITY.  Despite, our religions, our ethic backgrounds, society class, we are still brothers and sisters living on earth.  We should be looking out for one another, not killing people.  I believe every Religion on this earth wants the same things.........peace amongt mankind, children being children and growing into responsible adults, caring for family, and wanting every day to be better for every one living on this earth.  May God Bless each and every one of us and fill our hearts with hope, compassion, and empathy."
We want Trump back ad your president.. the world don’t fear Biden and he gives money to terrorist
"Oh please.  More Ukrainians are killed everyday.  Israel just whines and lies so USA can give them more money.  We already give them four billion a year.  American tax payer.  Freaken welfare state with an evil sense of entitlement.  Get over it.  You step all over people, they&#39;ll strike back."
"I am horrified about what happen to the civilians especially children. But stop blaming people for the situation like this guy with his mom. The current administration are doing their best. Dude your mom knew the risk in living in Israel. Let do our best and let us be unified instead to blame. GOP, giving back 6 millions to Iran don’t make the current president responsible. Again the game of blaming is absolutely stupid. Let stand United against evil period!"
What about those innocents palestiniens Israel massacred over 3 decades? Do they matter? What about the blockades? Illegal occupation. Don’t be bias. Tell the truth
"Don&#39;t let up the retaliation stop, till 2024."
HAMAS ARE TERRORISTS not MILITANTS!
Biased reporting. Typical Western media brainwashing. Barely covering Palestinians suffering and highlighting Israel&#39;s.
Hamas and Israeli pigs will pay bloody price this time
"I love and respect the people of israel and all the jewish people. But let&#39;s get one thing, very, very clear Benjamin Netanyahu needs to be examined and investigated thoroughly very very thoroughly because there is no way with everything that Benjamin Netanyahu tried to do to bring in a dictatorship to do away with voting and Israel taking the rights away from the Jewish people in Israel, loving Donald Trump another dictator lover which is what Benjamin Netanyahu was trying to do and Russia and Saudi Arabia funding the attack with weapons and money and let&#39;s not forget North Korea and yes Hamas did this what time do Financial backing and weaponry and there is no way no way no freaking way that Benjamin Netanyahu did not know this was coming he knew this plan was coming and never said nothing. Let&#39;s be real clear my opinion quit supplying weapons to Israel and money until they get rid of Benjamin Netanyahu the Hitler of Israel"
Your mom teror
the hostages will never be released alive regardless of any action. this is pretty obvious from how that invasion went.
"Well, maybe if they were a certain female basketball ball player that broke the law and cried, free me, im famous! They would have them out yesterday"
Why no one talking about ISLAM? It is pure evil!!!!!
I give NBC credit for showing real footage!
Did you all forgot how Israeli became a state in the first place?<br>Or are you trying to not think about it <br>Israeli was built over the blood of the Palestinians <br>How many Palestinians died because of Israel attacks <br>You think about it if someone killed your brother(Palestinians )and the police didn&#39;t don&#39;t anything about it(UN) What are you going to do ?<br>Let me answer this question for the shy people <br>(Get your revenge) <br><br>All of what&#39;s happening right now is just because of the Many years of killing and taking lands and making millions leave their homes <br><br><br>I really don&#39;t want to see wars and more people dying i hope this would all end soon everyone deserves to live
Same people that don&#39;t support Israel defending their land support Ukraine with a blank check
Take a good look Biden at what happens when borders aren&#39;t secured.
With no speaker of the house I don&#39;t know what the us is going to do can&#39;t do it by executive order Congress has the power of the purse
"Hamas is using American weapons bought from Afghanistan that Trump left behind..This should be a huge news story!,,,,,oh, it was Biden that left them?"
"If they do so, 1 for 6 Guantanamo prisoners worldwide. That will not scare us nor make us back down. Israel must have same mercy with them. Strategy... they want a Siria to bomb it to the ground."
"Our southern border has been open for years.  Get ready for terrorist attacks folks, especially if we get directly involved.  Stay strapped."
Why is the government responsible for finding people
Animals
You keep on repeating on Israel casualties in the war but keep on silience on  Israel crime every single day from the day one the illegitmate Israel state occupy the Palestinian land.
Praying for peace on both sides
Where&#39;s hamas now? Where&#39;s all your chants of allah akbar now?
"Children butchered by? Hamas? The insane butchers are so evil that Satan rewarded each one of them with a medal of evil honor, his new demons"
end the apartheid and the killing on both sides.
"I&#39;m really surprised that Biden can still read off the teleprompter, words that someone else wrote for him."
FREE PALESTIN...
Israel declared war. They have been killing innocent Palestinian civilians for many decades. Palestinians have every right to defend .... now westerners raise their voice and concern about Israeli settlers. where were you when they killed so many civilians and committed war crimes ? bloody hypocrates....
Ukrainians sold weapons to Hamas. 🔫<br><br>Defund Ukraine.
I blame Biden for giving Iran money. Iran then supplies Hamas with whatever it needs. Can&#39;t make this stuff up.
"Maybe don&#39;t illegally occupy Palestinian land,  let alone attend a &quot;peace&quot; rave on said land.  May Allah protect Palestine and its people"
All at American tax payers expense right!!!
"<a href=""https://youtu.be/rD7NI0tGbp8?si=EjOjF5Vz0i_V783V"">https://youtu.be/rD7NI0tGbp8?si=EjOjF5Vz0i_V783V</a><br><br>If you&#39;re not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing."
I do pray for Israel
"reality,, they are dead"
Soooo HEARTBREAKING 😢 I CANT BELIEVE THIS!
"It&#39;s resident biden,  Trump won!"
Amerika is who really did this. The amerikan government needs to start a war to postpone or even cancel the 2024 election. And they are so desperate to do so they’ll do anything including nuclear war.  The war they started in Ukraine did not go as they planned and escalate. So now they’ll try something different and this is it. Amerika is the worlds most evil country.
Those aren’t Americans. They are foreigners
Palestinian terrorist cheering now they playing victim
Those hostages died the moment they were taken.
That weird... all the street dancing in Gaza celebrating the attack on Israel has seemed to stop.
Biden will be found hiding in his basement when terrorists come for that PUNK!
"They sacrificed my Messiah . Guess he was who he said huh. You will never find peace. Unless you ask for forgiveness, and except him as your lord and Savior 🙏😊"
Biden needs to be removed for derelict of duty.
nothing but paid actors to get the US in another fraping war
"Palestine GDP - $18.04 Billion<br>Israel GDP - $488.5 Billion<br><br>Just face it they lost, just like how America took their land with guns, so did Israel. I just feel they should give up and stop more death, it sucks, they lost. Israel is the bad guy and they won end of story."
"And the US government wants to take away weapons from law abiding citizens, the criminals/terrorists will get them no matter what, they dont play by the rules, stop making it harder for good people to have a defense against the enemy. I know a rifle wont stop a rocket, but 50 concert goers with guns would sure help in a situation like that. US is being invaded at the southern border, but those people will only do sneaky terrorist attacks, too many americans are armed. Bless all those fighting against terrorist, sad times..."
"I&#39;m confident the US is doing everything they can.  Its a horrific situation.  When those Israeli tanks roll into Gaza, these animals will execute all thw hostages 😳"
"I am sorry that these people are hurting, but no negotiations should be made with terrorists!<br><br>You see what they did.<br>Your family members will die either way.<br> These terrorists only use them to make their opponent back &amp; bow down.<br><br> Because they know that you will allow them to do whatever they wish &amp; continue to do so, as long as, you get your family member back.<br><br>Then they return to take others while massacre whomever they please!<br><br>They win to terrorize more!<br><br>No negotiations!<br>Israel, level Gaza!<br>🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱"
it is unreal how there are people out there that support the hamas right now. so despicable. the far left sold their souls to the devil.
so instead of killing Hamas they&#39;re killing Palestinian women and children and this is ok
"I read that Netinyawho got a warning call from Egypt, and  HE called it FAKE NEWS... did he do it INTENTIONAL,, maybe to take control of everything????   and not go to Jail for crimes he has done."
Show us these images of babies slaughtered fake fake fake!!! This is all Americas fault and now more billions of our American $$$$ goes to an apartheid state pathetic we are over 33 trillion in debt
I guess it is only genocide and a holocaust if it happens to Jews. Such a double standard. Biden is a blood thirsty war monger.
Don&#39;t believe anything Hamas says to the media
God bless all guys with a good heart! ♥️
Israel destroyed the USS Liberty 🤣🤣🤣🤣
this is all propaganda for a war with Iran.  don&#39;t trust any of this BS sheeple
"Israel been wiping palestinians off the map for the last 25 years.<br>Just like Hitler did the jews Look at the palestinian map from 20 years ago. Then look at it now, you&#39;ll clearly see who the real terrorist is."
Biden talks the talk but then there&#39;s NOTHING!!!   He could EASILY cut off ALL of the FUNDING for HAMAS... But FAILS to do so!   It is DESPICABLE to use this atrocity SOLELY for political gain!!!
"I DESPISE Biden. Can&#39;t stand his policies and wish he&#39;d resign. That being said, it&#39;s not fair for this dude to try to place securing all the hostages unharmed on Biden. Remember, we don&#39;t negotiate with terrorists. The only way those hostages return is by the Israeli Defense Force and I hate to say it, I don&#39;t have much hope for their safe return. Israel wants to obliterate Gaza by wiping all Palestinian legislature off the map. In doing so, there is no room for peace offerings. Hamas demands the original territory pre UN in 1949. Israel isn&#39;t relinquishing one inch. Sorry for your loss!"
"Biden take responsibility? ummm .. ok, good luck with that."
Biden is an Appeaser he&#39;ll just pay the ransom and just do as told
Israel the bigger terrorists causing more terror than the whole world has seen since world war 2
"I feel bad for the guy whose Mom is being held. But blame Hamas. This is a war zone. The US Govt does not have control of the Gaza/Israeli war zone. They have to work out a plan, figure out how to negotiate. Yeesh."
-Which side is the good side??<br>-None
Pray for Palestine 🇵🇸 and the innocent children and people on both side
"USA is just taking,"
"I’m sorry, 59 years as a college educated American…….Israel has fallen short on their humanitarianism to their Gaza Strip Palestinian Captives for Decades😱"
No
Why throw shade on Biden?
Stop the crap it’s there problem
They are guaranteeing that those hostages wont see the light of day.<br>So you are bombing where the histages are as well???
They beheaded over 40 kids and babies..
everybody knows iran was involved in arming and training hamas finish iran the problem be reduced hugely
"usa needs to just say to hamas  release all our people unharmed or we will come get them . Keeping hostages iand killing Americans is not going to help keep the usa out of it , it will bring us in"
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23freepalestine"">#FreePalestine</a>🇵🇸"
"Looks like Palestinians had enough of the apartheid, ethnic cleansing, etc."
Yeah but if u have America poking their nose in then ur gona have the muslim countries that don&#39;t like America backing Hamas. Its just gona escalate more and more .
Anyone refusing to outright condemn this is endorsing the killing of Jews. Not the first time we’ve seen it unfortunately
ZERO confidence in the Biden administration!
I wish there was a warning on the videos at the beginning. The one of the concert goer hiding behind the car when the Hamas devil runs over and shoots the person dead. That one scene was a bit much even for me.
No corridor!
"Hey Joe, do the world a favor and step down. How&#39;s it feel to know, &quot;hey,  my weakness created all this.&quot;  You fool."
Nice act Lester. That&#39;s definitely all so real. Just like you. Real. These bad terrorists. With weapons of mass destruction. Keep doing you Lester. Jesus Christ is lord and king
There are no children killed her only settlers and soldiers don’t believe these zionists all fake news from them!!!
God bless Israel 🇮🇱 🙏 ❤️
Bound Netanyahu n Biden on d Cross n let indians prostrate
Why wouldn’t you broadcast Israel’s brutal terror attack on Palestine?
Tears from Egypt 🇪🇬 Justice for Israel 🇮🇱 <br><br>العدالة لأبناء الله
Israel’s response is an act of shearer evil😅
Who kills Palestinian children and civilians in the past 75 years?
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23flattengaza"">#flattengaza</a>"
They seem to be in no hurry to move in and free the hostages. Cowards.
I think Isreal knew about this and let it happen. So they can justify full scale operation to erase that strip from existence.
Go Isreal go! Remember the head of snake is in Iran: Khamenei.<br>Iranian people stand united with Israeli people and against Mullahs in Tehran. Iranian people love US and Israel.
The main reason why the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian cannot find a lasting peace settlement is because of the American government one sided policy against the Palestinian.
the US is not doing enough??! You have NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE DOING!! Think they will ruin the hostages hope for rescue by publicly giving out that information?!?!<br>😡
I made a post <br>Pray for ISREAL the holy land<br>Someone was angry with me.
It was an attack against the occupation.
Kjv Joel. Chapter 3??? You parted my land????
Why is no one saying anything about ideal commuting war crimes but are pointing out hamas war crimes
Shout out to Biden for giving Iran 6 billion who then funded Gaza.
trumpft should be in jail soon enough ❤❤
One sided biased reporting
Everything for crazy Allah🤮
Is this guy sick? He’s getting skinny
"Easy there NBC, Be sure not to mention Iran untill you have clearence. Its amazing how much news you coincidently seem to forget."
As long as we all justify killing threw religion or politics or greed we all will never evolve to heaven. In saying this know that I am not supporting any side for killing. Just say no more killing.
"NBC &quot;News&quot; is government sponsored propaganda.  Hint: When you hear the word &quot;retaliation&quot; never the word &quot;Israel&quot;, that is propaganda."
Pray for the innocent victims on both sides of this horrific conflict.
Answer to American families of the Hamas hostages: Israel will annihilate Hamas without negotiations. US can do very little at the moment.
What are you going to do Diaper Load?
Praying for the civilians on both sides.
"I hate to say this, but those hostages are probably dead already."
"Who&#39;s really terrorizing????? <br>If Israel slowly slowly forcibly  illegally occupied most of the Palestine territories since 1967 and forcibly made Palestinians to leave their motherland, then who  really terrorizing whom??? History tells us that there was NO Israel prior to 1948 and once upon a time it was Palestine........What role United Nations playing??? Isn&#39;t the belligerent aggressive attitude of Israel responsible for never ending crisis and loss of innocent lives since 1948 ???? Those who are taking sides and dont appeal for peace , they are Devils and shame on humanity..... 😮😮"
Vote Marianne Williamson in 2024!
Thieves propaganda
How many of you are willing to get nuked for your support?
"What a wank,,blameing biden for not doing enough?! Did they think he was superman,,flying in to save the day ?.like im sure chump will claim he would&#39;ve,,grow up you special people,,theres lots more than you in trouble at the moment,,"
Do you think this could be the one war that brings the middle east to the brink of a nuclear strike to end the war forever?
"They&#39;re both killings kids, what&#39;s the difference between hamas and Israel"
"Biden gave lot of aid to Palestine which was used to buy weapons from Iran, 5000+ rockets. Shame Biden .... Go Trump"
before the attack of hamas they are parading with missiles guns etc....mostly civilian people giving food or anything in hamas while parading they are happy it means mostly civilian people tolerated the act of hamas to start the bombing now the israel retaliates now the civilian who supported the hamas is crying like a baby and they get sympathy to all when they get bombed and the iranian congratulates the hamas for attackiing israel that is ridiculous and insane how can there be peace if there is someone act like iranian leader no brain and a war monger and they call their religion is a religion of peace 🤣🤣
Israel must flatten gaza and Palestine and destroy tunnels and escape routes to Egypt so hamas can’t escape which they should have done first Israel should have invaded the gaza Egypt border within first 12 hours they didn’t act soon enough and Egypt are harbouring the hamas terrorists
We desperately need Trump back.  The world was peaceful when he was Prez.
Palestinians will always be a vessel to attack israel. And it&#39;s time to stop the source of the infection. If Palestinians cannot resist outside influences from enemies of Israel. Then Palestinians are enemies of Israel.  Stop tolerating this untenable two state solution.
Biden will only get loved ones if it helps his campaign ie Black basketball idiots that hate USA
What&#39;s happening to the dome
"This song is dedicated to the people of Israel. &quot;The World In Which We Live In&quot;. God will be returning with his hand and a sword. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PmNjvL1qhs"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PmNjvL1qhs</a>"
Hamas terorest
Thank you for your weakness joe biden! Without you none of this misery could be possible!
Watching from Denver Colorado freedom&#39;s worldwide freedom&#39;s freedom&#39;s freedom&#39;s
"God help the poor defenceless, long suffering people of Gaza."
"One can any President do when Terrorist abduct hostages? W Bush, Obama &amp; Trump didn&#39;t make deals and the Terrorists simply killed the hostages no matter what. What Terrorists will do is move the goal post farther and farther every time anyone tries to make deals with Terrorists. Israel won&#39;t make any deals with Hamas. Best to do is not visit or live in Israel."
"Israel,  do not trust Joe Biden.  He is a snake and will bite you.  He cannot be trusted."
Well atleast israel isn&#39;t targeting civilians by starving them 😂
So why does the brainless Palestine fight that hands that feed them. Do you think other Muslim countries care about those inhuman Palestinian people. Absolutely not....
"Once Israel takes the offense the left media will demand a ceasefire and restraint.     Then they will, like menbc says, Israel brought this on themselves.    <br><br>What do they do much admire about Hamas?   It’s their willingness to murder Jews"
"What&#39;s the point of bombings empty buildings in gaza when hamas is still firing rockets on israel? The Israel can&#39;t neutralize hamas terrorist this way, israel need to change the strategy and use allied ground forces against gaza."
What does either side win when so many lives are lost?
RELIGION OF PEACE KILLING CIVILIANS WHAT A COWARD
Send in the Teams.
🔺👁⚠️There will never be peace as long as Caucasians continue to steal and occupy indigenous lands🔺 Heaven will be closed 🔺👁
sadly there is nothing that this useless President can or will do.. Inept beyond measure.... appeasement has never worked and we need true leadership not this pussycat who does not know what way is up...
They should level the strip.
"Why is Israel above International Law again? <br>Whatever Hamas is or did, Israel is a terrorist state bombing about a million children in Gaza now!"
Are we going to see an interview from the other side?
"What baffles me is that Israel didn&#39;t have any intel of this attack beforehand. HAMAS did the muslim community no favour with this. I am horrified and scared, my heart is with all people suffering. As an atheist I once again am confirmed that religion is STUPID and always leads to violence justified in the name of a higher being."
Zero reaction from Kamala. Like stone.
They’re freedom fighters. Last 70 years they&#39;re killing innocent people’s and occupied the land of Palestine.
Nobody defended the Palestinians  when the Israeli’s have done nothing but vicious  bloodshed towards the Palestinians.. The US never intervened and protected the Israeli’s for their vicious actions. But the Israeli’s are always validated for their  horrifying actions.
Israel is only bombing known Hamas command and support centers rather than indiscriminate carpet bombing. Of course in any war there will be unintended civilian collateral damage. Israel is not engaging in a Dresden or Tokyo type bombing. Gaza residents can&#39;t  cry after they stood idly by &amp; cheering on Hamas while they indiscriminately slaughtered innocent Israeli women and children. I don&#39;t see Gaza residents dancing and cheering Hamas barbarians in Gaza streets now! You shall now reap what you sow. You can always try fleeing Gaza by jumping into the Mediterranean and try swimming to Italy or flee to your buddies in Egypt or Lebanon.😢😂
Nothing that Isreal hasn&#39;t done to the people of Palestine. <br>Israel is just as much to blame.<br>Free Palestine
"If Russia had cut off water, food and electricity the west will be condemning it in full force. But this is Israel and Palestinians are not white Europeans in Ukraine so the west is silent."
i dont know who in America will stand with these terrorist these actions of babys and execution in live tv thats not humans thats terrorist acts who in there right minds will support this chit
The left has no right to be upset over the babies who were executed
"Before the IDF attacks in Gaza, it tells everyone to evacuate the houses, it does not massacre them or bomb them for nothing if there are no terrorists there, it cannot be compared to what the terrorists did in Israel, it simply does not make sense, their evil against small children who burned them alive, it does not make sense."
"this all seams off, to many fill in the blanks. yes I believe it is happening but all this footage sneak attack seems off w all the tech and the usa watching the worlds every move by satellite how?"
Hamas was elected therefore all Palestinians in Gaza are Hamas
Calling it &quot;retaliation&quot; IS the Angle.
That was not a terror attack. It was an act of war
I too want the hostages to be rescued of course. But it is not President Biden that will do it. It is up to the Israeli military. I pray for their success. <br>I hope this man gets his family back as well as all the other people suffering and fearing for their loved ones.🙏
Bunker J0e:- &quot;Did I really start this Hamas war? Oh! my sorry a$$!.&quot;
We don&#39;t trust your reporting.   Sorry!
"If tomorrow you choose to go to cartel country in Mexico and get kidnapped or killed-that my friend, is on you. If you choose to settle in a kibbutz in Israel near the Gaza strip and get kidnapped or killed by militants, that my friend , is on you. Either way, don&#39;t cry and demand that you be rescued because of your own stupidity."
Why do they choose to show blurred footage and call it &quot;chilling images&quot; hahah mainstream media is so G rated just watch some disney movies and pretend nothing is happening
Civilians don&#39;t carry guns near Gaza!?
The death toll will only increase. Right now no one is winning its just a tragedy and I even doubt there will be a &quot;winner&quot; in all this.
"This could never happen in America. You would have to leave our borders open, allow 1.5 million illegal aliens to disappear into our cities, ( most single males of military age, tens of thousands from the middle east), take away guns from people, provide them weapons from afghanistan, provide sanctuary cities for them, and pay them until the time is right. Yeah, never could happen here."
I so badly wish Biden wasn&#39;t President right about now.
the US need not worry;  Israel will put an end to the Hamas vermin.
"The USA is being invaded by millions of criminals at the southern border with Mexico.   Report on that ,  dudes."
"The US should stay out of this war, Israel has every capability to handle themselves in this war."
Palestinians in jogging outfits...no official uniforms.
"Gaza should empty out of people so they don’t get killed by militants. I don’t know where to tell them where to go but they need to get out of the way . If you can gather your loved ones and leave Gaza  . <br>It doesn’t matter to the militants if your Israeli or Palestinian ,they are being inhumane and killing children, babies , women , men ,<br>Very cruel ."
"The blacks looooove Hamas.  They think they are great. Just came from NYC and it is frightening how much the african american population support Hamas, Palestine, and defend all of their rapes, murders, and kidnappings."
Biden can&#39;t make a sandwich
Nothing on here about the israeli invasion of sacred muslim grounds preceding the retaliation...?
"All options are on the table. I&#39;d say, let them fight it out. All is fair in love and war. In war, it matters not who&#39;s right or wrong, only who&#39;s left."
So if Israel has a responsibility to fight back and you have their back...do Afro Americans have that same responsibility to fight back against terroristic law enforcement attacks...and do you have our backs?
You might as well say if you fight Israel you are fighting America
"should jail those who support to Hamas, hate should not be tolerated!"
sending hopes and prayers!
NOW imagine Izrael multiplied by 10 ... that&#39;s what you got goingnon in Ukraine and the massacre that ruzzia created. stop loosing focus on bigher picture
It was great when Trump brought peace to Middle East and Biden undid everything. Good job Liberals
I want to know more about Trump&#39;s role in the 6bn Iran deal. Something doesnt look right here 🤔
"Thanks Joe, gonna give anymore money to Iran? Embarrassing, when evil doesnt fear the US, this is the result."
TRUMP NOW!!!!!!!
There is only one option at this point: Free Palestine.
Hamas is a symptom of oppression !!!! Get it ????🙄
who are the REAL animals?
Israël has been terrorizing Palestinians for 100 years !
"They&#39;re not &quot;animals&quot;, they&#39;re humans. Media should not allow this propaganda or Hate speech."
"If so, Palestinian civilians should give position&#39;s of HAMAS."
Hid in the woods like a straight coward
Did it snow out there?
"This world. It&#39;s 2023, soon to be 2024.....The world still can&#39;t find peace. Horrific!!!"
I see my freedom of speech is violated by youtube.
"<b>The Israelis are brave as Mexicans are too ,mexico supporting Israel</b>"
we cannot negotiate with terrorist. if we do next month they will have a fresh batch. then what ?
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6G6MWe6IQ&amp;t=2m24s"">2:24</a> was Biden giving some kind of secret signal to Netanyahu?"
Sorry dude but your mom&#39;s gone.
By the end of the week will Gaza even be a livable place? 😮
"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes"
This is not terror attack the 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸 they need freedom :: free 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
I love these scripted questions. &quot;How does that make you feel?&quot; &quot;Do you worry about your fellow comrads?&quot; Duh? What do you think hot shot. Perfornative journalism
"And give Hamas what in return for the hostages?<br><br>We are now STUCK in what is the only response, something Hamas planned and wants and the far right of Israel wants, ... true war against Hamas and the Palestinian civilians of Gaza.<br><br>This will be very bad."
How there there people family... The palestines families and their loved as well do they not count??!?!!!!!🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷
"I just don&#39;t get it, from the video, you can see where those rockets were fired from, if Israel keep drones circling the whole of Gaza, they will [pick these guys up and drop guided missiles or bombs on them.  The rocket batteries may be mobile, but not that mobile."
Sounds like its time to put their special forces to good use..
Hamas act like ISIS
Having American citizenship and living in a country that is an active war zone does not obligate America to go to war if they become a static. Just saying...
Its absolutely unrealistic to think our government can do anything to rescue anyone from these barbarians
At this rate that will soon become condos and beach front properties for the isrealies
Obviously this is a disgusting senseless tragedy but it pales in comparison to what has been done to Ukraine. Not to minimize this in any way but we should not lose our focus on Ukraine. That is why Putin orchestrated this. Don&#39;t fall for it.
Hamas is provoking Jehovah to retaliate against them for Thier murderous crimes! He will repay them! *&quot; any nation that deals unfairly with Israel will be delt with by Jehovah! He promised this in his words! Paiestine can go live in the Saudi Arabia dessert.
Biden is incredibly weak and incompetent. A strong leader would&#39;ve sent the message that if anymore Americans are killed that we would respond viciously. <br>A competent president wouldn&#39;t have given 6 billion dollars to the biggest sponsor of terrorism.
Hamas did this with Qatar money. Isolate Qatar.
Islam and peace don’t mix level the strip send a clear message
"As Hamas can rain the rocket at peaceful Israel concert, can Israel rain the rocket at the Muslim Prayer in Mecca?"
"Hamas, is beheading children. I can&#39;t believe how putrid and inhumane Hamas is."
"If any American decides to place themselves in harm&#39;s way by going to an area of hostilities, then that is their choice.  No one should expect the U.S. government to place others in harm&#39;s way because of individual/personal decisions to visit high risk territories.  All Americans have the freedom to make stupid decisions, but then they should also bare the consequences of those decisions."
"Wait, why is America chipping into this war?"
Those poor Palestinian people should of never allowed Hamas to fester there in the neighborhoods.
Time to send in the Marines!
now show us what Palestine had to endure<br>for the past 70 years.<br>U.S. media   you can do it  😉😉
Lester Holt looks like he shrunk.
give me a break.  What can the US or President do in such a situation?
It would be a miracle if those hostages come home
"More MSM gaslighting and stale footage. Think for yourself, what is the narrative here? Where are they taking you??"
How about  Palestinian babies killed ? They are not human USA don’t make things get worse talk try to do pice
Hamas = ISIS. Palestine sealed their own demise. Level Gaza to ground
"Isreal should turn the Gaza region into a pile of rubble and then annex it, if anyone has trouble with that then turn around and say &quot;Well Putin does it in Ukraine with support from Arab countries like Iran, so why can&#39;t Israel do the same?&quot;"
"Its hard to say anything contrary in this climate but, ALL WE ARE SAYING...... IS GIVE PEACE A CHANCE."
"Send robot armies, not men."
Biden supports Israel. Funny comedian
Hamas What about you calling for roadside assistance and or DoorDash ha ha ha ha ha or coupons for razor blades Hah Hah Hah Hah Hah
What Hamas did was a terrorist act. What Israel is doing is a terrorist act.
😞 No more American troops dying in the middle east .  😓
Palestinians we are with you.
Interviewer: &quot;are you hopeful that your mom is still alive?&quot;<br>Where do they find these morons.
"Demanding Biden go get hostages out.................How?<br>There are tunnels, there are armed suicidal maniacs, it is an insane situation to say the least.<br>Hamas has it&#39;s own agenda."
"The fact that Israel is the enemy of humanity is enough to bomb innocent people in their homes for 80 years. Yesterday, the Jewish defense said &quot;We are fighting against human animals&quot;. And that is a testimony that he is an animal. When the people of Islam are being killed they are animals! right?, that is something that God is witnessing."
"Turn Gaza , Iran and Lebanon into a lake,"
Biarkan palestina merdeka. 💪 Hamas.
"Turn Gaza , Iran and Lebanon into a lake,"
What was hamas’ like follow up plan after the attack?
Wipe the Palestinians off the face off the earth  completely
"Biden will not do anything hes a weak leader !!!!! he&#39;ll draw redlines in the sand and have no plans to back them up. he is just like his 2016 POTUS time in office. WEAK just look at how the last 3 years have went tossed money at everything, END of the world to him is climate change.. Tell that to these people.. Biden is a waste of time we need a real leader!!"
Two wrongs don&#39;t make it right.<br>Children suffering and dying on both sides.
"Babies being killed? That&#39;s odd, Democrats support that here in the United States so that shouldn&#39;t be a concern"
Both sides have not excepted Christ as long as that is the reality it will always be &quot;an eye for an eye and tooth for tooth&quot;
"IF YOUR NOT CAREFUL THE MEDIA/NEWSPAPERS  will have you hating the people who are being oppressed ,and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.. <br>THATS MALCOLM X  <br>PUTIN SAYS THAT OFTEN  AS  WELL"
And don&#39;t pay the son-of-a-b*<b>*</b> is either
I’m not backing Hamas.. neither Israel…. one is invader and the other is terrorist…
Are those the same Americans who go to Palestine with their Israeli passports? Is Hamas in every apartment buildings the Israelis are demolishing?
Savage animals.
"Jared Kushner clearly solved the Middle East, as promised"
I got news for you United States of America needs to take care of our citizens don&#39;t know who will
Then do it punk back up ISRAEL
The balls on these people. The only reason Isreal exists is because of the US! On top of that english is not his first language. You owe Americans everything.
The answer is....Jesus
Israel&#39;s American equipped superior mitlitary will smash Hamas.  Once ths is done it will return to Palestinian childern throwing rocks at Israeli tanks.  Even David couldn&#39;t take out a tank with a sling shot.  Or could he?  Think about that.
Glass it.
CHASING THE KILLER OF JESUS CHRIST
"When you have the support of Saudi Arabia who openly hates you then you know Palestine messed up. <br><br>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Palestine loses half it&#39;s territory to Israel. The most important Rule of War that everyone agrees on is that you never kidnap civilians in broad daylight , record and upload their executions because not even your friends will come help you. RIP Palestine"
Israel is the real war criminal in that conflict. TYoo bad they are backed by the other war criminal : the USA.
Wait when did Biden start caring about baby’s and gender?
I&#39;m sorry but what do you want Binden to do send the 82th air born in
Obama &amp; Biden gave 6 Billion making Hostage of a American Profitable again? 2Q007 Aloha.😎
"So sad for the concert goers, children from both sides, women, kinder men, elderly"
Britain created this mess
"<a href=""https://youtu.be/mvqCWvi-nFo?si=tjg5GiZyE_bpPReD"">https://youtu.be/mvqCWvi-nFo?si=tjg5GiZyE_bpPReD</a>"
"Can we also talk about the massacres the IDF committed in the late 40s through 60s to scare Palestinians away from land and villages so Israelis could take them and occupy them illegally to this day? You can&#39;t invade something that was yours to begin with. Palestinians have zero rights under military rule and the two state solution is something Israel voided right away.  It&#39;s time we stop israel from having Carde Blanche simply because of American backing and what they went through the Holocaust. Did Balfour and Lloyd George ever asked the Palestinians for their opinion before they carved out Israel and set them up? Nope. Can we really think of Israel as a victim or as victimizer with all this being predictable, by oppressing people simply because daddy Sam has their back? Can we blame Palestinians and Arabs and non Arabs for starting to side with Palestine?"
never forget muslims are having their homes stolen by isreal and they use the courts againt muslims <br>this is a fight againt jews stealing property<br>not a random terror attack but a punch back at thieves
😢
We are mourning but this what I do not like for people to start blaming Biden. Saturday we all woke up with this.
"I&#39;m so happy I made productive decisions about my finances that has changed my life forever. I was once a nobody living in Birmingham UK, but today I can proudly say I owned two houses and I&#39;m hoping to retire next year at 48 years if things keep going smoothly for me."
Watch..... All the nations of the world are heading to the Valley of Jehoshaphat
WHO IS THE KILLERS OF JESUS CHRIST
"&quot;We do not negotiate with Terrorists&quot;    If you pay them, they just kidnap more people!"
The Israelis are all such brave good people.
"I wish this news wasn&#39;t one sided, and report the truth from both sides"
Down with Gaza
Support for Israel 🇮🇱
Go an help them!!!!
Why do you think the President of the United States owes you ANYTHING????   Bad stuff happens to Americans EVERYDAY in foreign countries - including kidnapping!
"You asked for it, you got it, motherf---ers!"
Religion of peace my butt.
"I would think the worst is over, the hard part will be weeding out Hamas from the civilian population."
I am still waiting for Israel to counter strike the area where the rockets were coming from instead of just intercepting them.
No one should visit or move to the Middle East if they don&#39;t want to risk this nonsense.
America need to mine its business we don&#39;t have the money for they war!!!!
How many terrorists are coming into the United States due to Biden open borders policy?
"Good. You will go back to a time where you lived in caves. Every standing structure in Gaza will be turned to rubble, one by one, until you give up every one of the babies and grandmothers and women that the leaders you voted for kidnapped, abducted maimed and tortured. •• You will bury your children and then cry for generations about the murder and massacre of innocents you celebrated in the streets.. You will cry in a hole .. for a ceasefire but it will be too late. The retribution hasn&#39;t really even begun yet"
European colonialists occupying Palestine
Maga- &quot;Trump is our war weapon!!&quot;<br><br>Trump - &quot;I can&#39;t even own a gun!&quot;
This is what happens when you oppress a people for seventy years in their own land
Very said about that they are getting ready to stop no wars
European COLONIALISTS what are you doing in Palestine
"Not carpet bombing, Not winning."
Hamas = ISIS
"😒 maybe they should use their Jewish space Lazer. Hypocritical, manipulative, antisemitic/CHRISTIAN NATIONALIST, psychopaths. Republicans complain about Iran selling weapons to Hamas and using them against civilians, but not Russia.😡The United States is the largest oil producing nation on earth. What happens when Republicans burn it all down so they can engage in the self declared intent to genocide of LGBTQ people, ethnic and religious minorities and political opposition? The ability to export ANYTHING will vanish. And now there&#39;s a dumpster fire in the middle east.<br>The US dollar is the primary reserve currency for a majority of banks GLOBALLY. The US dollar won&#39;t hyperinflate, it will evaporate immediately. The US dollar isn&#39;t backed by a commodity like gold. It is backed by the good faith and credit of the US GOVERNMENT. But, now.......🤷what US government?<br>😡We don&#39;t want to more of your manipulative jridhftir! &quot;We are a Christian NATIONALIST country&quot;......... that&#39;s what you said. Which means NO LIBERAL HOLLYWOOD ELITES ALLOWED!<br>THEN, NOW! <br>NOW you&#39;re pulling the same crap about Ukraine. Calling it the 51st state. <br>And now we Can&#39;t, CAN&#39;T respond. If Biden doesn&#39;t, he&#39;s abandoning our allies. If he does, Republicans call him a WARMONGER. Using either excuse to justify their own genocide of LGBTQ people, ethnic and religious minorities. Mexican invaders, BLM, Muslims. 😒And those 😉😉&quot;Hollywood liberals&quot;.✡️"
The aliens are like &quot;see&quot;. 👉 &quot;This is why we don&#39;t want to be friends with you&#39;re crazy a&amp;$es.&quot;😅
"Biden can’t take the responsibility of putting his pants on in the morning, how is he gonna get anybody away from Hamas?"
US Liberty
Palestine will be free إن شاء الله
"Is it &quot;retaliation&quot; when a cop shoots at a terrorist? Of course not--it&#39;s protecting the public and is an act of self-defense. Please stop using the word &quot;retaliatory,&quot; as it suggests both sides are equally to blame."
"The British are responsible for this mess, why does the British always get a pass?"
Israel is targeting specific military (HAMAS) targets. The victim card doesn&#39;t apply in this case.
Native Palestinians CAn relate to native Americans
She lives in Israel. Let Israel look for her.
Dislike  that&#39;s my comment
It&#39;s a vicious cycle.
Have we tried giving both sides Pepsi?
i wouldn&#39;t doubt it if Israel knew the attack was coming and let it happen anyway in order to give them the green light to do all this brutality against the Palestinians.
Israel is the instigator. They have killed people in Palestine for decades.
"Americans should not be in those situations. They all know or knew that this is and always will be, a War Zone. We put ourselves in vulnerable situations."
"Russia and Iran have been working together in munitions and this has moved into other areas.  Putin needed a diversion to the Ukrainian situation.  He was having major problems with US support for Ukraine.  He knows the Israeli Lobby in the US is far more powerful than the Ukrainian Lobby. Even though it won&#39;t be an existential threat to Israel, because of the Lobby&#39;s power and the large percentage of Jews in the media, there will be an overwhelming focus on Israel at the expense of Ukraine."
"I think we can agree this is Hamas&#39; war to lose.  Syria and Egypt failed in 1973 during Yom Kippur, Hamas will too."
"I am a citizen of Iran and I want to be the next speaker of the house for the United States of America. I love telling people what they can do and what they cannot do and I don&#39;t even have to give up my citizenship to do this. I much rather be a bully than a snowflake when it is done at other people&#39;s expense.<br><br>In America, you do not have to be a United States citizen to become speaker of the house.… The third most powerful position in the United States government. I can&#39;t help but wonder what Isis is working on these days? It has already been reported that Isis (waking up from their sleeper cells) will be in all manner of politics and social programs of the West. They say they can marry themselves into the system educating their children on the dole at taxpayers expense. With that kind of thinking they should be president.… They do know how to spend a dollar."
🇩🇪🇮🇱❤️
Hamas doesnt give a crap about Palestinians lives. What did they thibi what happen when they cause 9/11 level terrorism in their neighboring country.
Good thing we left all those weapons in Afghanistan so that hamas could put them to use🫣 absolutely disgusting administration
Could y&#39;all imagine if this happened in your neighborhood!?
"Peace can only be achieved when one side wins and the rest are dead. Sad but true and I think the world should just let what happens, happen."
Pray for the world
while the world is suffering from climate change and animals are dying all over the world .... we stupid humans are killing each other ... there is no hope for humans...mother nature made a mistake to create intelligence on this level
"All of this is plain sad, and unfortunately there is no peace in near sight. Any hopes for reaching a consensus and peaceful cohabitation have gone out the window for a while now."
Massive brain wash
Seriously? They expect us govt to find people half a world away . . Smh<br>Get real.
ISRAEL IS A LIE
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🙏🏼🇵🇸🙏🏼🇵🇸🙏🏼🇵🇸🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🇵🇸🙏🏼🙏🏼🇵🇸🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🇵🇸🙏🏼🇵🇸👍🏼🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🙏🏼🇵🇸🇵🇸 god bless the Palestinian resistance.  Freedom justice
Israel is committing mass murder now. This has to be stopped.
It’s a war ! Trumps documents shared with Putin who shared with terrorist probably started the Hamas attacks on Israel! And Trump praise’s terrorist live on tv ! Praying for all victims in Israel 🇮🇱 🙏🏼
"Lot of coffin dance routine remixes happening, probably."
This must have been planned for a while..
This world is so scary
I can&#39;t hear anything
God help them
