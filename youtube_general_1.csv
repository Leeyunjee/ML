"I have never felt dumber watching a video. You sir, are out of this world. Great video, thanks for sharing."
"Amazing work! Congratulations!<br>Really enjoyed how you explained your progress and the fact you also explained how we can do it ourselves.<br>Please, keep it up!<br>Can&#39;t wait for more content."
"I&#39;m just some doofus with no AI background but I feel like the way to get it to take oak&#39;s parcel to pallet town would somehow involve  rewarding it for encountering new dialogue? Or that unique dialogue can signify changes in explored locations? It&#39;d definitely bog down early iterations running back to pallet town everytime something new happened, but I feel like rewarding it for speaking to people separately from exploring screens could be part of the puzzle."
Cool!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=6m55s"">6:55</a> little &quot;Yippee&quot;yey&quot; moment üòÖ"
"First off, 3.7Million views in 2 weeks first video? That is one heck of a record to start at. Hope you make more. <br><br>2nd. I agree with everyone that it would be cool to eventually see a full playthrough of the game if it were possible. With you able to interact, I wonder if that could mean you could force it to memorize new actions and even learn puzzel solving skills. Like with lieutenant surge and the cut tree. Forcing the AI to ram itself into the tree and interact with it to make it realize it can cut down objects in the world to move around."
What is amazing is that we can learn so much about our daily lives why people are not moving forward and our reasons not doing things we need to do.
I won&#39;t be impressed until it completes elden ring with no armor and club only.
"That ai plays Pokemon through attrition... It&#39;s not learning anything about the game. It&#39;s a version of &quot;10,000 monkeys with typewriters.&quot;"
Did we see a AI kill itself over it depositing a Pok√©mon and losing 13 levels‚Ä¶
"Have you considered integrating a gpt style AI that could read the NPC prompts and complete quests? <br>You could reward it for completing questlines, and it would give it more direction. I know all the dialogue is written as prompts inside the gb file you could assign it to seek out certain dialogue to keep it on track and give the dialogue a score based on relevance."
But does the ai learn how to play? Or only make misc decisions till i gets a net positive then repeats the same till it gets a overall good result? Cauae obviously at no point is it actuslly learning and taking in game elements and understanding them? Maybe i&#39;ve over complicated this in my head.
But.... Doesn&#39;t that mean that if these AI&#39;s fail even after learning a lot... Would mean that... They also might be humans that are in a simulation which also points out that.... All of us could also be just in a simulation?
I cannot imagine the amount of zubats it ran into
This is absolutely insane and so much work went into this! It&#39;s so cool to see how the AI learns like humans tend to
Tell the truth how long did it take you to edit all those screens together? As an editor this was absolutely gorgeous and so well-made. if you edited this you are an excellent editor because putting all the screens together was a work of art.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=31m15s"">31:15</a> idk if that&#39;s a grilled cheese or what but I&#39;m here for it"
It cool it was learning speed running techniques like running away from fights and finding optimum strategies.
Amazing video. The pokemon music gives it the magival touch. With 31 years I&#39;m finding a new way to play my beloved Pokemon games:)
"If you are still having issues with the character finding the second gym, you could probably update the code to reset the exploration after each gym badge. Could make a larger reward for the badge obtainment to make up for the negative but it also does give the model more opportunity to get exploration points at it is a game that requires back tracking."
Imagine a Million Ash Ketchums running by you in the Forest just smacking the dog shit out of all your pokemon over and over and over infinite times.
This reminds me somehow of Naruto&#39;s training method for the Rasen-Shuriken :D
More videos plz this was a very cool video
"Awesome experiment! Just a few thoughts. First you mentioned cost of running this experiment and I hope you get the funding you need. Either from YouTube clicks or scholarships or finding a way to stream this on twitch/youtube or funding from the scientific community because this is great experiment. Secondly, I would like to see the ai choose its starter. This is the biggest choice a pokemon trainer could make and I would like to see if changes its choice in run throughs. I say this because Charmander learns ember which is super effective in the viridian forest, but weak against brock, also changing the starter would give unique screens for rewards (if im correct at least 3x).  Just a thought and I hope for the best, really great experiment."
Best Pok√©mon video on YouTube right now. Change my mind
Fascinating video! Congrats
"Thank you for the time and effort to share such a cool idea. I really enjoyed experiencing what you accomplished. I hope you produce more videos, you have a very interesting take on gaming, programming and human psychology."
"This is a wonderful resource, not only the technical aspect of the simulation but also the video editing, the thoughtful explanation of the entire process and the tutorial at the end.<br><br>Amazing work."
I wanna see this ran on Zelda.
But what pokemon does it start with?
"You should try pokemon gold next, or you could try to make the ai finish pokemon red"
dude holy shit what an amazing video how are you only at 40k subs. I&#39;ve never opened git faster than I did right after your video. AND YOU SHOW US HOW TO INSTALL IT AND WHERE TO EDIT?! BRO THANK YOU.
I can&#39;t even imagine the effort put into this but please please make more
amzing@!
Insanely well made!
All the trainers together look like ants!
<b>Virtual shadow clone jutsu learning</b>
"When you say it bought 10,000 Magikarp, was that across more than 40 versions?"
"Damn its sooo good like not just the ai development but also the illustrations u showed  on how the ai navigated its paths in blue,yellow coloured arrows ...<br>I could really like to know how u did this ...‚ù§‚ù§ just amazing"
This is one of the best implementation and visualization videos on the subject I&#39;ve ever seen. Amazing work!
For the algorithm! ‚ù§
"Good video, I suggest to dwelve more into the practical procedure of ppo, like having the model in memory while another copy is being ran, etc. Ppo is like the secret sauce everyone is hiding. Youtubers tend to show the results or mention like &quot;here we train&quot; but the exact method to apply the reward is not described. Thank you, good video."
Why do you have to pay to run these tests can‚Äôt all the information be ran on your computer and stored in your files?
"Wow this was so good. I hope you put out more content like this. The AI is impressive and all, but comparing Magikarp to junk food was on point."
can you make one for any of the 2d mario games? :D
im not sure how to run your script for learning on a gpu? im using pytorch
"This is incredible. I genuinely don&#39;t even have words. It&#39;s purely incredible. Fantastic work, man. Instant sub and I hope you do more interesting stuff like this!"
I am really curios to see what happens in regards to the boat at the second gum whete u can quite easily almost intentionally  self lock yourself out of completing the rest of the game
can you plz tyr geting the ai to win the game. love your videos.
"Whoa! That step-counting for an easier pok√©catch was pretty slick. It makes perfect sense that the AI would eventually learn to use RNG-manipulation, since it&#39;s learning the most efficient way to proceed. A lot of games have something like that; but there a couple that I know of from my own game collections.<br><br>- In Stardew Valley, animation canceling can help you completely avoid taking actual in-game steps, which affect important parts of your game, such as when there will be a rainstorm.<br>- In the first MegaMan Battle Network, the RNG was way more obvious than the rest of the games. Mystery data would often be identical, if you did the same button presses, but it was a little harder to get frame perfect.<br>- One  of my favorite step-counting RNG-manipulation bits in the games I personally play/own comes from Golden Sun. In it, there&#39;s an intentionally super-rare weapon that you hardly ever get as a random drop... unless you do some RNG manipulation; then you can get it without fail, and multiple times, while you&#39;re at it."
can you show the coding process? It would be very interesting how the ai functionality itself works on Pokemon in particular. or can you recommend some kind of video or course on the internet?
Genius
"Amazing video, this took 1000s of hours of work <br><br>great job<br><br>best video i&#39;ve seen for awhile<br><br>better than mr beast"
"I don&#39;t know anything about ML, but you mentioned that the AI gets stuck in a long Mt. Moon passage because everything is the same around it. The exploration reward is a great idea, but diffing screenshots doesn&#39;t seem like the optimal way to do it. Would it be possible to read the current coordinates from the emulator&#39;s internal memory and store those instead of a screenshot? That way, the incentive becomes &quot;I must explore coordinates that I haven&#39;t been to yet&quot; instead of relying on visual similarity. Plus, I think it would speed things up, because storing a set of coordinates will for sure be smaller than storing a screenshot."
Amazing video
"It‚Äôs funny to think of e.g facebooks algorithm, then we are the Ash being trained."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=8m36s"">8:36</a><br>It just rage quit"
I wonder how nintendo feels about using its games to develop AI<br>I hope they dont get nasty later on
AI calculates the situation and creates simulations to beat a calculator.
I actually looked this up specifically a week ago. I  have always found AI in games fascinating and wondering how long it would be to see something like this. Great stuff! Would love to see what&#39;s next.
Holy crab I just realized this is your first video. Immediate subscribed and I cannot wait to see what you do with your channel!
Wow. How did you retain my attention for a whole 30 minutes on a subject I know nothing about. THAT is your true talent. Well done
This is one of the most fascinating things I‚Äôve ever seen. You deserve (1) reinforcement point in the form of an award. ü§ô
This is an amazing achievement. Did you do this all by yourself? Google and Microsoft must be calling you to work for them üòä
I would love to know how many undiscovered glitches this program found by just going about its buisness.
"&quot;A.I.&quot;<br>can someone tell me how it takes 50 million instances for distributed supercomputers to become the best chess, dota, starcraft player, and it only took hours for @TayTweets to come out for concentration camps and  &quot; &#39;H&#39; did nothing wrong &quot; ???"
"i think next time you could plan a bit better ahead, instead of just yolo training the AI :P"
I am truly stunned by this video. Great job! :)
"nice vid, maybe the anticlockwise thing was from where it entered the first town and you have the openness on the right prompting reward?"
Very fun video but the ‚Äòreal world‚Äô examples were too forced.
Great video and its nice that you have the code so easily accessible. I have a question. On the Github you mention you can run it on 16 cores with 20 GB of RAM. Where do you have access to 16 cores? Do you have your own setup with 16 cores or do you access a server somewhere?
Perfect work :)
&quot;AI gains 14 experience points&quot; was an amazingly poetic way for this video to end.
Wow. What a great video! Very entertaining and I feel like I learned a lot. Throughout the video I started wondering &#39;how the hell do you actually visualize these AI videos?!&#39;. So I really enjoyed the part in the end about how you actually did it!
AI is a based Squirtle enjoyer. Best starter don&#39;t @ me
Now we want a sequel that makes it to the end. We want to see it become the very best that no AI ever was.
Please consider doing a full game run using reinforcement learning. This video is so fascinating!
Okay this is absolutely amazing &lt;3
Amazing work. This was extremly fun to watch. Wonder how it would play out if it reaches E4
"I want to install this, interfere to get it past the spot it gets stuck at in Mount Moon, and see what happens from there..."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=17m30s"">17:30</a> - just wondering but does the screen always pan at every movement, or just when you are far enough to the right/top/etc.? For example it would pan up when moving up on the RHS of the map, but not pan when moving left from the same spot, it&#39;s reward system would advocate for the movement that pans the screen."
"Got mine up and running, it&#39;s fun to watch while taking a break from work"
"Why did you start with so few rewards? <br><br>You know the objectives of the game. Get all Pokemon, all badges, get max level, win battles, keep Pokemon alive.<br><br>You add some slowly over time, but seemed way late."
It&#39;s like we live in tens of thousands of parallel universes.
Amazing work homie
"I am very excited for more learning examples using a curriculum, to reason about what alternative strategies better fit a new situation"
Is it a violation of ai I learning to present the AI with basic game rules?
I would never ever expect I learnt about why I like junk food and eat them in a technical and fun video about AI... ü§£
"As many mentioned, my jaw is on the floor!! Not only good at your work but also to create a perfect storytelling for the video, as a creative, im really impressed.<br><br>Creativity comes from boredom and distraction! As you discovered in the video :)"
Nice Work. Question will the AI finish the game?
Squirtle picked 100% of the time?
"In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=9m20s"">9:20</a> (PC Trauma) how can we imagine that the AI avoids Pokemon Centers, i thought the AI is just trying everything out to get rewarded but does not build this kind of intelligence to know that entering a Pok√©mon center is good and will be rewarded. How did u program  the AI to remember good actions and repeat them in later game?"
"I wonder if there can be different sets of reward systems/functions based on the current environment (exploration, battle, etc.). It would be cool for it to figure out (and exploit) type matchups!"
"Kudos for the implementation. You didnt discover ground breaking theories but you applied existing one beautifully, I cant imagine the hours put into this project"
The ai being scared of Pok√©mon centers because it was hurt so badly was actually so sweet
"So, correct me if I&#39;m wrong but does this only work on Linux/UNIX systems? I&#39;m trying to get it to run on Windows 11 and there are various issues. I couldn&#39;t find it but is the emulator built in?"
Great video. Wish the compute wasn‚Äôt so pricey but really interesting results.

Amazing work man. You will honeslty inspire many here to create their own project and learn more about this domain!!
bro ... u run it all and yet no insights about charizard?  cmon where is the data?
"Thanks and congratulations for your work, it was really interesting"
AI/ML aside I‚Äôm impressed with the video editing. I‚Äôve never looked into it myself but am curious what tools they are using. Anyone have a guess on what tools he used to edit this video?
"at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m02s"">4:02</a> i felt personally attacked."
Bro you really did the shadow clone training technique to speed up training and results
Oh man! I&#39;ve never seen such a well-made video. Awesome work! Congrats!!
&quot;Hanging out and admiring the scenary is more rewarding that exploring the rest of the world&quot;<br>YES BUDDY YES
"If you have an infinite numbers of monkeys with an infinite number of gameboys, one of them will eventually become a Pok√©mon Master."
So interesting! Very good explaination and well chosen topic!
"It is amazing and fantastic! As one CS student, I was wondering about whether it is possible to train AI grouping a super team to achieve a high win rate in PVP. Your project is so inspired!"
It&#39;s more interesting how this video was made than artificial intelligence. Making emulators run multiple games at the same time? Will you show the map widely?
Awesome job! keep going!
We need to see AI finish the game <br><br>Please
Hope you got an A
"The effort, the result and the video. All extremely impressive.<br><br>Next up, Rocket League with AI? :D"
Really interesting - great video - would also love to see it beat the game!
This is a fascinating video man great job
can i  use the yellow / blue verison or the gen 2 pokemon games ?
Amazing stuff!!
How did it acquire pokeballs? Did it learn to go to the store or did that have to be hacked?
Did he also discover the Missingno glitch?
bro this is so amazing. Thank you for putting the work in!
"if you found this video interesting, read the book I, Robot. its not like the willl smith movie. its like this, analyzing unexpected behaviour in a different robot model based on the 3 rules they gave it in its programming."
Superb content!
"soo fascinating, great job!"
Hats off to you as I know these visualisations/explanations would have taken a huge amount of work - absolutely brilliant job
was it a paper work? Because it&#39;s really incredible good work
"well put. as a pokefan and ai dev, this is very insightful. <br><br>keep it up.<br>Lots of love"
Did it encounter MissingNo??
"this is so interesting, like in a way AI is faster than us, but in the end we learn faster"
"Thank you for this.<br>The YouTube algorithm did me right on this one.<br><br>As a 33 year old man, the music from these games has become one of the easiest ways for me to access a topped off dose of nostalgia and longing.<br><br><br>If the persona you have given in this video is even remotely accurate. You are an incredible &amp; bright human. Thank you for all of your explanations. I can‚Äôt help but be curious how you learned and got into doing these experiments."
"May I ask you how you what do you mean with version? Does it change everytime you change the design of the rewards and state or is it the number of time you re-train the agent? And what RL algorithm did you use (SAC, PPO,..)? I am learning RL, but I am still a beginner"
Id love to see more of this
bro you didnt showed when the game started cheating by explointing the code :/. great video! hope we see it beat the game and a next episode :)
"very nice project, i want to train mario land"
In 5 years I would like to see an RL algorithm play Baldur&#39;s Gate 3üòÖ
"when i was 6 years old i remember getting to Rock Tunnel without HM05 Flash, I had no idea Flash was even part of the game &amp; I remember using the sounds of bumping into the wall along with the contrast wheel on the old gameboy to try to see but it was pretty much useless.  somehow i made it thru without flash and watching this video gave me nostalgia back to the trial and error of that first playthrough when I was 6 years old &amp; hadn‚Äôt ever really played video games before, thank you for this video i hope you can have it finish the game would love to see what it does when it gets to needing HMs.  also the fact it named so many pokemon AAAAAAAAA due to button mashing was also too close to home üòÖ"
"Couldn&#39;t the &quot;trauma of depositing&quot; simply be fixed by changing the reward system to include stored pokemon in its count as well?<br><br>Or better still, evaluating the level of <b>defeated enemies</b> rather than that of active party members? This seems to me like it would encourage the AI to look for efficient approaches/teams over brute-forcing its way through the game with high level pokemon while avoiding the oh-so-punishing pokemon centers. Not to mention it would naturally guide the AI forward through the game - beating stuff in an earlier area isn&#39;t as rewarding as beating stuff in a later area because the enemies are higher-leveled."
This was a charming video. You have a knack for editing and explaining technical stuff in an approachable way. Looking forward to seeing what else you come up with.
"Is there anyway i could run this for my students on a raspberry pi? Id love to show them an AI being trained, but just dont have the processing power at school to run that many agents in parrallel. Could a Pi cope with running 1 or few agents that could learn? And if so, is there a script that would run just a few that could learn at a time?<br><br>Thanks!"
How many Magikarp have you bought?<br>AI: Yes
How much memory are you talking if you wanna run the ai training model?
"Now that I think about it, I do really understand the traumatic experience the AI felt and how it responded. I did the same when I was young and unable or barely able to read and understand english (which isn&#39;t my mother tongue), yet still trying to navigate an english version of Pok√©mon Red<br><br>My main feedback on how good was a move in battle was looking at opposite pok√©mon health going down. Therefore, I saw status afflicting moves as useless (especially on the very first fight were winning depended mostly on how much turns my nemesis &quot;wasted&quot; by using growl)<br><br>When a pok√©mon had the chance to learn a new move, there was no (obvious) way for me to know if the move was &quot;good&quot; or not since I didn&#39;t knew them, didn&#39;t had a game manual at the time and couldn&#39;t understand even the meaning of its name. Taking a new one was risky of wasting a useful move with a useless one. Therefore, when I finally bruteforced my way through the 8th badge, it was with a level 70 Charizard that knew tackle, scratch, ember and probably cut!"
"50k hours = 6 year, bro your click bait is stupid"
How did the AI get past delivering Oak&#39;s parcel? I&#39;m curious because that part requires going back through areas previously explored and since it was only rewarded for novelty in environments at the beginning that seems like it would&#39;ve been problematic.<br>Edit: Watching further answered my question
"Hmm.<br><br>Could you maybe, record a run made by you, then assign a gently escalating rewards for each gym leader beat, and then bump it up a step for the elite 4, then up again for the champion?<br><br>With a first run baseline as a human, and it then knowing what the end goal is, I wonder how well it would do?<br><br>When it had that traumatic reaction to negative rewards, it avoided the entire building forever.<br><br>If the champion had a similar positive reward, to what lengths would the AI go to reach the end?"
"Wouldn&#39;t it have been better to start with Bulbasaur? It&#39;s strong against the first two gyms, it isn&#39;t affected by poison, and Squirtle is also weak to the Pikachu."
Blach. Everything wrong with the newage. What is the point of human existence. To automate its own existence? Meanwhile I&#39;m still homeless and can&#39;t afford anything lll
Thank you for this video ‚ù§
Did it win?

Dude this video was DOPE and brought back so many memories
"SICK video, well done mate"
MAKE IT FINISH THE GAME.
The AI thinking Poke centers kill Pok√©mon is wild
Idk how I got to TAS Pok√©mon but I&#39;m in it and happy
How can I access this? I‚Äôd like to learn how to access using something like this
"‚ÄúThe ai is learning how to move, and is just walking around‚Äù really explains a lot of my online teammates in first person shooters."
"Wow! not only you did an amazing job with the code itself, but the quality of the explanation is breathtaking and the video editing is just amazing. It is just incredible how good you are at three different highly specialized things. Congrats, and thanks!"
"Ayo, After letting it run it never saves or restarts the run it just crashes after less than an hour."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=9m35s"">9:35</a> bro, I felt bad for poor AI, bro lost 12 reward :("
As far as the cave is concerned there are 2 options. 1 include audio input since Pok√©mon has a triggered audio output when attempting to enter a coordinate that is invalid from the current coordinate. Have the A.I. gain 1 point per run for each coordinate collision trigger
I cannot believe they just have an AI ptsd lmao
What I&#39;m curious about is how long an ai would take to beat the game without rewards
"Okay so... Maybe this was covered towards the end with more efficient/cheaper models, but-<br><br>How difficult would it be to setup a reinforcement learning model which is tasked with making the original Pokemon reinforcement learning model more efficient?<br><br>Why not develop a secondary &quot;game&quot; which rearranges points in order to change the outcome and efficiency of the first initial game?<br><br>Is this possible?"
You may note that setting up a working reward functional is very important and a careless choice of reward functional often leads to a silly results.  Human brain is a reinforcement learning algorithm of which only reward functional is triggering dophamine pathways.  This is why we are broken by reels/tiktok/youtube shorts/etc
"The comparison with humans makes it sound like dissertation material haha, loved the concepts though, awesome videos!"
"Came here for AI, left with philosofical questions"
Do you reward it for the healing the pokemons when needed?
Avoiding the pokemon centre AT ALL COSTS just to avoid the evil PC reminded me of Twitch Plays Pok√©mon
Its like in the matrix movie when agent smith took over.
"Is it possible to use a list, graph or LLM to store city names mentioned in the conversations had in game (in order of city mentioned and maybe as a set?), then apply half (if that&#39;s possible) the reward to the ai for going back to investigate only those cities mentioned. That way, it doesn&#39;t explore the whole map needlessly, and it could help with the issue of revisiting cities for the progression of story<br>(Would cost more resources, tho)"
"Hey! Great video, really informative! I was trying to run it on my own computer, but it seems argparse_pokemon is no longer a module? Is there anything I can do to substitute that module? Thanks in advance!"
"As someone who is a programmer who is leaning towards ML and love video games (Pokemon is one of the few that got me started), this is such a cool concept/video"
New AI EV training bot when?
Brilliant
This is an incredible video thank you so much for all the hard work you have obviously put into making it! I hope views blow up for you
This is the most satisfying video ive ever seen please finish the whole game!!

Has this channel really grown to nearly 40k subs from just 1 video? Crazy but understandable considering the quality.
"This was a very well made video, i truly deserves a part 2. I don&#39;t care if it takes months as long as it&#39;s worth it."
"Amazing video, honestly expected this channel to have millions of views and a ton of videos, what a great first project."

In your junk food analogy you failed to realize the goal of living for a lot of humans is no longer surviving or reproducing...
Insane first video
"So, what happens if you use an AI to program an AI? :)"
neat!
"Esto es incre√≠ble, muchas gracias por compartirlo ‚ù§"
absolutely fascinating

"I am obsessed with this. Fantastic video. If you could find the time to distill all of the parts of this into a series it could be come the &quot;donut tutorial&quot; of ML.  Great work in all parts(script, visuals, presentation , etc)  Thank you for sharing this project."
Imagine this with age of empires
"This was me as a non-native english speaker kid in year 2000, but instead of 20000 bots I tried all the possible combinations all by myself to complete the game without knownledge of english language üòÇ"
Ok but can it beat the league and complete the poke dex
"Dude, you are a genius! I am taken aback that this is your first video. Your skill, knowledge, production value and way of balancing what can be a dry subject with interesting information and funny tidbits is absolutely amazing! <br><br>I am seriously jealous, with your skills you are gonna go far!  <br>I am subscribed! Would love to see more Pokemon AI stuff, but understand if you wanna go a different direction as well."
There‚Äôs a video on how AI is helping us translate animal language ! The future is here and applying it to Pokemon is worthy cause ‚ù§
gg
"This was fascinating.   I could watch this for hours.   Like pokemon factorio.  I have so many questions. Would it, if given enough time, create a speed run?"
this video is so well done. would love to see ai beat the game
I find this fascinating... But I have no skill to do it myself... Also love that pokemon from gameboy was used as it&#39;s such a simple game
If one day the game npc is Ai... I hope it will more fun...
"I love in depth, technical videos. There are only a few people that do it as well as you do. With only 40k subscribers, this amazing."
fascinating :0
As long as the ai is sad because it lost a pokemon i think mankind is safe
Very interesting work. When can we expect a paper on this?
"Can&#39;t believe this is your only post, i need so much more"
"Very interesting to watch. Thank you for your thorough presentation! I love the vector visualisation of its average moves. The more technical bit at the end was also very informative. I really like that you did both ends of the spectrum of &quot;quick intro, some fun things to observe, some key learning moments&quot; and then &quot;NOW LET&#39;S GO FULL NERD&quot;"
"This is awesome, please make this into a complete serie with it eventually defeating the game!"
This editing is almost as impressive as the ridiculous amount of work that must‚Äôve gone into making the ai so sick
This is an incredible video ! Thanks
does it only work on red?
its like naruto¬¥s training with 1000 kage bunshin¬¥s xD
"This AI video hits too close to home. Ask a girl out, got rejected. Never try again. Went to college, didn&#39;t graduate freshman year, dropped out and quit for life. On the plus side, i can now watch this awesome video at 4 am."
Man I can&#39;t describe the amount of nostalgia I am feeling.  Just took this 33 year old father way way back for just a little bit haha great great video and you got my subscription
This is one of the best videos I&#39;ve ever seen on youtube. The amount of effort that went into this single video is mind blowing. You have my massive respect
"How would it even handle HM moves? Not just teaching them, but using them outside of combat? I think it would get soft locked hard."
"Great. First they will take over our jobs, and now they will even play instead of us. Why to exist anymore?"
You should give the AI points simply for moving to combat them getting stuck in those visual deadzones.
"Is this actually the first vid ever uploaded to your channel?? If so, almost 40k subs in 13 days and off a single video... that is insane<br><br>Goes to show what a fantastic video this is! Initial idea, technical execution of said idea, editing and the storytelling script is just top quality (i also loved the thought provoking comparisons).<br><br>You have my sub and I&#39;m genuinely excited for the future of this promising channel ."
Imagine being a brain-in-a-jar being trained like this haha
"I&#39;m going to impressed if you can transfer this to another game and make it learn that next one much faster. Five years of game time just isn&#39;t close to a human. If it learned some concepts, then it might be a bit like a child learning over time, but I really needs to be able to transfer that to another game.<br><br>But thanks for the experiment and for sharing it."
your sound so good!!!
It&#39;s awesome!!
This is one of the most interesting videos I&#39;ve ever seen
Why is it always squirtle?
It was so interesting when the A.I gained  a phobia of the pokemon centres after it accidentally took a serious punishment for depositing a pokemon xD
Dude spend years to just do this x_x&quot; I would&#39;ve build a full game by now
The experiment is a remarkable art. I am very moved every time it ‚Äã‚Äãimproves in making significant discoveries about game progress.
Thank you for all of your time and effort in this new tech using old tech
"Wow. Great video, I could tell a lot of hours and energy went into this ‚ù§"
Amazing!!!
Why do you need to use a cloud server? Dont you have a PC?
How do you reward AI?
AI leveled up!<br><br>Learned: More learning!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWdUkudsmE"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWdUkudsmE</a><br>Does the video in the link have your translation authorization?"
"It&#39;s amazing how closely this parallels my child playing a game on my phone when he can&#39;t read the instructions. He just presses things randomly until something happens. Then I tell him the goal. He still does things randomly, but he can tell when he&#39;s made progress."
"I wish I had the time and resources to do things like this, but I have to publish or perish, ship or sink.<br><br>Regardless, its good that someone in the world is doing it."
üéâ
Now number them.
vedal needs this for Neuro-sama
"dig on fast food was hilarious too, clever man you seem to be"
bro just do a video of it compelting the whole game now that this has blown up most of us dont give a fuck about the coding half of the video we just want to see the lilniga ai succeed
"If you ever do have the AI finsih the game, I think it would be really cool if you let the same AI try Pokemon Gold. I think seeing if an AI trained on Gen 1 could play Gen 2 that would be an interesting experiment"
"This is interesting for many reasons, mainly because it&#39;s an AI learning how to play a game"
"I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a good or bad thing that a part of me is terrified by this, but thank you for this unique, incredible piece of work. Very well narrated too. Greetings from Switzerland"
"Okay, this was pretty darn cool, great job!"
"This is not AI, just glorified bruteforcing"
I did kinda wish you let the ai pick the pokemon. Would have liked to know what ai thought was the best one. Maybe a future one where it gets to finish the entire game?
Go you adorable little trainers!
"AI don&#39;t exist, it&#39;s just a program that write codes according to rules."
"I love seeing this kind of stuff, but I honestly wonder why no one is making other AI types such as a hybrid between classical AI structures and neural net AIs."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=8m31s"">8:31</a> didnt know that AI could ragequits"
"For the movement, you also need a coordinate system.<br>At the moment, you‚Äôre telling it purely to look at pixels to see where it is, without any reference to what ‚Äúwhere‚Äù is.<br><br>I.e the starting point is 0,0<br>If it moves to 0,9 and the screen is different +1<br>If it moves back to 0,0 and the screen is also different; +1 (because it‚Äôs probably gone through a doorway)<br><br>Teaching it to interact with environment variables with HM moves is going to be interesting‚Ä¶"
"A well made and well explained job! As a Gen 1 Pokemon fan and an AI enthusiast, I have enjoyed every second of the video. Thank you!"
How did you teach the AI that +1 is a good thing?
Bro AI is basically naruto multiple shadow jutsu training itself to beat the game
at least twice I thought there was gonna be a hello fresh ad insert but there wasn&#39;t one. <br>Such a great video very entertaining &lt;3
Awesome job and great video to watch. Congratulations.

Amazing quality for the first video on a new channel. Hope you can keep this up because I&#39;d love to see more. :)
"Great job, Peter!   MIT VISTA has a 19-neuron-like Reinforcement Learning (RL) module they use for self-driving cars and I think they have their source code publicly available.  I suspect that Tesla&#39;s Full Self Driving (FSD) release 12 is likely using what MIT did, or something similar.   It would be interesting if you applied MIT VISTA&#39;s 19-neuron-like RL to Pokemon.   Again, great work, and thank you for sharing!  -John"

Very well done. Thank you
God is just the homie training his Human AI on the game of Earth....
Reminds me of ants how it explores!
Didn&#39;t understand most of the things but just wowü§Ø
This is too wholesome
You are amazing May i know where you learned all this
Sadly not executable on my m2 mac. I will try it on my x86 windows computer later this evening :/
"Pretty soon we won‚Äôt have to play video games, AI will play them all for us so we can be more productive with our time."
This video was so cool! Awesome voice. Awesome visuals. Informative educational. Nostalgic. Please keep making these
Woow üòÆüòÆ
"so much heart be put into the project, this vid as well. really enjoyed watching."
I&#39;d love to see a study where a game is released like this and both the AI and human data is collected and put side by side
"Its so funny, its looks almist the same when i playing pokemon on smartphone with speed x2 i run as the ai do üòÇ"
What you actually did: Create the most overcomplicated maze solving algorithm
This is like the Egg theory üòÆ we all are in a reinforcement training!
Really well done - found myself hungry for more content after this <br><br>Great stuff - you making more? These are GOLD

This was such a quality video. I loved your explanations and commentry. You are born for this. I hope to see you perfect this AI and have it complete the game and possibly have it reinforced to do a no death challenge?
"i&#39;m surprised that after changing the level rewards (only giving points with positive level change), the AI didn&#39;t just constantly deposit and take out pokemon, since that would technically give it infinite points pretty quickly, since it can&#39;t lose points via depositing."
"You made a massive error, almost unforgivable. You didn&#39;t use pokemon yellow. That&#39;s bad man.... (I jokes, great idea, much enjoyed it. :) The large composite level maps were great :) )"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=10m45s"">10:45</a>, I really enjoyed this part. It reminded me of those moments in life when you always manage to get by using the same method until one day the level well increases... It&#39;s as if you&#39;d always bet on good old Charmander and always won because you had a relatively superior level, but the day that level increases you&#39;re lost. Personally, it reminds me of my high school days, when I didn&#39;t have to make much effort, always using the same technique to get to the next level, and oh boy did it feel weird when I had to compete against people of a different level. My Charmander was no longer working against the Geodudes and I had to learn more, like in your video. After that, I haven&#39;t reached the League yet either, so I guess we&#39;re still learning..."
&quot;AI found Mew&quot;
"i opened the video for curiosity, and i wasn&#39;t able to stop it.. i watched it till the end.. nice work!"
Amazing work and idea. Please keep us updated if you decide to keep going.
"bro this is insane, just thinking in the amount of work, effort and time you put on this. Excelent job, I&#39;m amazed üëèüëè"
Loved the video. Can&#39;t emphasize how impressive Pokemon red and the other games are. Total storage less than 1 MB? Hardly believable
"Hi, I found another youtuber is translating your vedio to Chinese (poorly btw). <br>Wondered if they ever got your consent? You can find the video by keyword - &quot;Áî®5Âπ¥ÊôÇÈñìÔºéË®ìÁ∑¥AIÁé©20000Â†¥Pok√©monÂØ∂ÂèØÂ§¢&quot;<br>Hate to see people stealing other&#39;s quality content for traffic."
"The production value is just phenomenal. Interestingly, it taught me more about human psychology than AI. Especially the part that paralyse us when we make a mistake and find it hard to move on."
Easily the best Youtube video i&#39;ve seen in 2k23

AI vs LT. Surge gym...
I would love to see the AI beat the Elite 4 trying to get as fast of a time as possible! <br>To see the Pokemons it catches and the route it takes would be super interesting!
"I‚Äôm not sure if you have thought of this or not but maybe add a reward for the cumulative levels of unique Pok√©mon in the inventory and the computer storage, that way it can fill out the Pok√©dex with somewhat natural progression thru the game"
"I reeaallyy want to see this AI complete the game. This AI playing Pok√©mon, makes the AI feel like my friend üòÇüò≠‚ù§"
"As an ML engineer that&#39;s a pretty simple and very understandable video. I think you did a great job showing AI to a much broader audience. That in itself has a greater impact than you might understand. That is to say, it should have a very high reward value in society but we don&#39;t always assign it one. Good luck."
Very interesting video!
Insane job!!‚ù§
The AI made a series of steps to get 100% success rate in catching a Pokemon on its first try. Does it mean that if we integrate it on genshin impact to execute wish we get 100% 5star  on every tryüòÆ
Amazing work.
cette vid√©o c&#39;est une masterclass merci le boss
I&#39;d argue that this is not AI. It would not work without an actual intelligence deciding on the rewarding factors. It&#39;s a failure reduction system based on input that is not generated by itself.
beautiful!
Naruto learned like this before it was cool
"I could watch you for hours on end. I just might once I finish this video! Thank you for putting so much time and effort into this!! :] I know zilch about any of this, but I love pokemon. It‚Äôs neat to see our behaviours explained in the way an AI works to learn to play."
"Fellas, I&#39;m an AI engineer, with a short background in Reinforcement Learning for a period I interacted with Sony for a job.<br>I need you to understand the MAGNITUDE of these results.

wow man wonder full code will learn from your code !!!
"Hi. I am a Korean game programmer. The valuable experience of trying over a long period of time provides a lot of inspiration. Your video is more valuable than any of the seminars I&#39;ve taken recently.  When I make a game, I think I will try to use it through AI learning and simulation.<br>Thank you for sharing this meaningful video. :-)"
"I&#39;m in complete awe! :&#39;O<br><br>Like, seriously, the talent it must take to pull this whole video off is just mind-blowing, surreal... Please, spread your wings and soar, my friend!"
does this model can be trained on gpu ?
"What a piece of work, man !!! Well done."
Now we need just 1 solid ai playthrough without a shit ton of screens
Awesome video! Would love to see the AI beat the game!
There&#39;s only 1 suggestion I would have made.<br>Number each and every single one of them somehow as their name. It would be fun to see which number did really well etc.
"Thanks, my friend! You combined everything I most love in one video."
Seriously brilliant video man. Well done
More videos please
Their Taking Over!
This is great!
Do you get the ai to finish the game?
Ai can already read why not have them read to learn a game better
How do I do this on windows...........
I need more AI playing Pok√©mon plz
"Don‚Äôt worry AI, I too was traumatized by the OC box when I accidentally let go of all my just caught Pok√©mon thinking I was putting them in my party."
Im junior dev. python was my first language and i love it. im really think about learn AI Training and try do somethings like that
"The 3 frame memory was very interesting.  I am wondering whether it would work well, to store each subsequent frame at 1/2 resolution of the previous frame.  they would pack into a framebuffer pretty well and give much longer memory, at the cost of resolution over time.  Did you try such a strategy?  any good/bad thoughts on this?"
Did you teach it to read? Can you? Love this project!
You could have built a reward function that rewarded it every time the music changed and bypassed a lot of these problems.
This was great
Conspiracy theory: Outer Wilds was AI running this same experiment back on us.
Pokemons easy I&#39;ve watched a fish win a pokemon game before
"this is really really cool, but you make maybe a few too many elaborate human comparisons for this ai, at the end of the day its just pattern matching to bespoke rewards. dont listen to my wanky criticism though its super cool"
"Not sure if you&#39;re aware of or not, this channel took your video, removed a few things, and uploaded it for themselves.

Really enjoyed the video and way you presented the information. Im excited to see what else you upload.
Pls post a video of the whole game walk-through after all the learning
why no video fo it running? üò¢
this is profound!
wow this is crazy good
You should also create a scientific paper about this... amazing
"Wait if you implement a exploration-reward by comparing the current screen to every (unique) screen it has seen before and you let it run for 2 hours, wont that cause it to run extremely slow over time? Since the set of screens it has to compare the current screen with is increasing constantly"
"Amazing video. I would love to see the AI eventually beat the game, can‚Äôt imagine how long it would took though üòÇ"
"In 5 years, you‚Äôll come back and take this experiment to an astronomical level, because it‚Äôll be the video that got you dominating on YT. Fantastic video."
amazing job!

It would be so cool if the world of pokemon are not npcs. They should be ais. So you never know how thinks going and there is always a different game with a different end like an open world
alright FINE ill replay red for the millionth time
But how long until it beats the elite 4?
"A better method to avoid problems with the level counts would be to keep the maximum level as the reward. Meaning if the AI deposits a level 10 pokemon, and then trains a new pokemon to level 11, it would get the reward for level 11, not the entirety"
"I was just curious at first, it&#39;s so interesting I need more! I&#39;ll be waiting for all future video !"
You are brilliant. Nice work man
Great job
"I hardly comment, but I felt the need to on this one because of how much work you put into it. Great job!"
"I just realised what&#39;s been bugging me on this video. You keep showing images of a classic game boy, but pokemon red was on the gameboy colour. üòÖ"
Great job! Well thought out and executed
Proving that Squirtle is the best starter from Gen 1 with AI...love it
Did it beat elite four?
Amazing job!! Congrats!!
Incredible! Well done!
I&#39;d love to see what it&#39;s final team would be
"I think your artificial intelligence has already left the game and the code has changed so that the rewards are likes and followers, and if that&#39;s true, you&#39;ve already gotten your reward from me. In addition to being the first GBA game I played, this video involves a lot of time and hard work. Congrats fromüëèü´∂üåçüáµüáπ"
"In general, this was a brilliant video. However, the ending where it caught a pokemon, named it &quot;AI&quot; and proceeded to win the battle was such a beautiful ending. :&#39;)"
"ah man. I really wanted to get this running on my windows machine. <br>Couldn&#39;t get past the install -r requirements.txt,<br>Maybe someone will release a tutorial on how to run this on windows. <br><b>hint hint</b>"
I hope there is more to this. I‚Äôd love to see it get further in the game and how it‚Äôll handle it.
I like the way the ai reacted when you would subtract points for losing a battle and the bot would just not click the a button to not get the point penalty
This is a masterpiece! Well done!
Great video!
The hardest part to me seems to be the visualization part.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=5m45s"">5:45</a> trainer only runs away from battles<br>Squirtle&#39;s name is AAAAAAAA<br>Checks out"
Very Nice.
At least you&#39;re only using AI to prevent people within a small industry from being as successful instead of trying to wipe out genres of art I guess
the part on the gentle programming is neat.
This is one of the best videos I&#39;ve ever seen
Its all fun and games until these things learn there is an outside world üòÇ
I want to see part 2 where it figures out how to get out of Mt. Moon.
"at aeound <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=17m30s"">17:30</a> you see that the AI&#39;s get stuck in the flytrap. I&#39;ve seen this behavior as well from someone uploading AI stuff for Trackmania. In both cases the AI&#39;s don&#39;t seem to realize that there is a &quot;bad&quot; section they shouldn&#39;t go to. They discover by walking around and walking off the ledge altered the screen so they might have registered it as a viable path. They don&#39;t seem to actually register the walls as a blockade or a 1way street. If you&#39;d let the AI learn to discern objects they can or can not pass and between situational (slowing/stuck untill action/etc) tiles I bet they&#39;d learn to navigate maps a lot faster. As for sticking to a wall. I don&#39;t know for sure but my guess would be that they don&#39;t actually hug a right side wall and just go UP, but in reality they go UP 1 tile, then try to go RIGHT but see no change, so next is UP again. Might be worth checking out. <br><br>1 possible way around having AI&#39;s get stuck is by letting them &quot;see&quot; 1 tile around them so you&#39;d have a 3x3 grid. If then they try to move to a adjacent tile then they could &quot;remember&quot; that particular grid along with the direction they tried to go (up/Down/Left/Right) and store each unique tile this way along with the 4 possible directions. With a memory of those tiles you can then have the AI decide if its worth steering in to that tile or not. With the 9 tile grid with it at the center the movements should become better and in case of this 1way route flytrap they should be able to see it as a wall and move along like they do regular walls I think."
Can&#39;t wait for your next video.
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Do actually input the reward structure on the software your using so that the ai can Progress? <br><br><br>Isnt that how we human just give random advice. On order for the human to create a new pathway of reasoning and curiosity.
"Refuses to press the button, omfg"
"What kind of goal is it to see pixels? It also makes the ai wonder around aimlessly. No one plays pokemon like that. It should be to become a pokemon master. I think a survey of Pokemon players reasons for wanting to play Pokemon and the goals of the game should be programmed. But hat&#39;s pretty vague and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s difficult to program AI. It should also have the goal of getting to the next pokemon center without all it&#39;s pokemon fainting, and remember what areas it&#39;s been to and what areas it will have access to next"
This is insane....

"The thing about abusing the point system happened at 1990 World Cup. At the time 2 draws = 1 win, so most teams wasn&#39;t scoring any goals in two matches and only scoring against the weaker team of the group, getting the same points they would get winning two matches and losing one. Next year, FIFA increased the points of winning up to 3, so 3 draws = 1 win and 2 loses."
"Wow!!!!!!!! I literally feel like a kid again, I remembered that feeling of loss as a young kid playing these games. Realizing how I learned, as a child was kind of a mind blast."
"Awesome video! I wonder if its preference to walk counter-clockwise just has to do with the order of available directions it&#39;s checking. &quot;if(can move left){ // } else if (can move down) { // }...&quot; etc. Randomizing the available directions at intervals would solve this but then create a new problem of the character taking wild, erratic paths instead of straight ones."
"Data Scientist/ML practicioner here, you did a fantastic job building this and dissecting the video! Can&#39;t wait to see more!"
This was very interesting video to watch. This reminded me of playing Pokemon red when I was 7 without knowing english and just press random buttons to figure out how to play.
Is it legal to play pokemon on mac os? I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs legal way to play pokemon this way

Oh sure. Now it&#39;s rewards for catching pokemon and become champion.. until it decides humans are like pokemon and it must become their champion. üò¢
"Stupid question but, how did you overlap the map and all the movements the IA did? I am genuinely curious"
"Man, your pedagogy is impressive. Bravo!"

"I&#39;m so impressed by your ability to construct this experiment and make sense of the data, while also visualizing and explaining it so thoroughly. Well done!"
Was I the only one who really hoped it would get to the point where it could glitch and get unlimited rare candy and then just watch the AI literally overdose on the level up incentives!<br><br>Alas it didn&#39;t make it that far!
Technically this is a pathfinding algorithm. Just with a very complex cost function.
this reminds me of when Naruto uses shadow clones to learn rasen shuriken
Really good video. Got a sub more +1
Awesome video! You&#39;re very good at explaining complex things in simple terms. The visualisations also help a lot. Thank you for making this.
"Fantastic video Sir, I thank you for providing me fun way to spend the time waiting for my train üòä"

What would happen if the model had memory from the very first moment and every moment after that up until it needs to use the memory to make decisions.?  would it be able to remember a shorter way to reach a goal or reward . and would that evolve into something that would casue it to speed run its self towards the finish line ?
"For me people like you are heros, thanks for sharing"
This video Is SO goddamn FAKE that even my cousin that Say &quot;mew under the truck&quot; knows that i s fkin FAKE
That was very interesting about it moving anticlockwise. When I play games I tend to move clockwise when there are many paths available so I know which ones I&#39;ve tried and need to use
That&#39;s why we will be destroyed by AI. Millions years of evolution in just a few days.
"AI noob question, would it be possible to combine this method with a set end goal (beat elite 4) and get it to work out the optimal method?"
"This is so cool, cheers mate."
"There&#39;s something oddly satisfying in seeing the AI learning and adapting. I can relate to the random button pushing from so many games, it&#39;s a bit nostalgic."
"very nice explained, can you please make a video how to make from scratch such an AI as you did ?"
beautiful
You could add reward depending on life of pokemon
I would have loved to see this going on till the Elite 4
"damn, hanging out in pallet town in hope for novelty is the AIs version of addiction."
"So fucking crazy, seriously. I loved this game as a kid and still do. Thanks for the tremendous effort"
"genius, very creative. nice idea!!!!"
"Apart from the obviously awesome and successful AI experiment displayed, complete with amazing visualisations, can we stop and appreciate the beauty of the original game and music?! Gives me shivers of 50% nostalgia, 50% admiration for the objective quality of it. Developers and designers were a different species back then. You can tell despite the dreadful Japanese working culture and the insane technical challenges of the time, they managed to embed some emotion and poetic sensibility into that game. And in under 400KB?! On my desktop I have a 2-page, text-only PDF which is that size."
This was so interesting! Please do more e.g. charting the AIs development journey through the rest of the game? You&#39;re a great teacher! ‚ù§
i thought AI would be smarter.<br>why isn&#39;t it able to read a 0 and then say &quot;okay pick another one&quot;?
Great Work üôèüèª
Need to see it get past Mt. Moon! Great work
Got me kind of scared talking about the AI being traumatized and then the music changed..
AHHHHH NEED PART 2 SO BAD SET UP A PATREON ILL LITERALLY PAY YOU
"This is absolutely fantastic, and I&#39;m only 1 minute in. Things like this remind me of why I originally got into computer science."
So tasty cartridge
"this was boring to watch, how disappointing."
"I helps me to remind myself, that at the beginning, these systems are at a HUGE disadvantage compared to humans, because they have no prior knowledge about anything. They don&#39;t know what left or right is, how 2D space works, what a health or a battle or even the concept of &quot;more&quot;  are. They start like a baby without any instincts in a very different universe. For this reason the field moves more to transfer learning, e.g. using large language models with their implicit world model to help robots deal with new situations, e.g. Deep Minds Gato."
Awesome video!
Production value on this video is unreasonably high. Impressed!
"What happens when an hm is needed, like flash in that dark cave? Cubones mother?  the flute to wake snorlax? What about the casino and buying the pokemon there? <br>Gym badges? If they level to fast and dont respond to commands? <br>The item that shares exp with the group? <br>There are so many question for later game play"
Imagine having this much free time to figure out something so useless. Damn i miss being young lol
Blow my mind! Congrats!
üî•
"This was awesome. I always wanted to learn about ai/coding, more specifically, how it learns and overcomes challenges that we never even thought would pose a threat. And that fact that it depositing a Pok√©mon was interpreted as such a bad move (TRAUMATIZING) IT AVOIDED the poke center was enlightening, captivating, and interesting all at once."
I didn‚Äôt expect to get thought provoking life lessons from this video. The analysis of the AI learning from it‚Äôs mistakes and trying to become a better version of itself and comparing it to basic human function is special. This video is amazing!
"as college student, this was extremely interestng to watch, loved how you integrated AI and compared and portraited it to in real life stuff"
its not artificial intelligence but accidental intelligence lol.
Can you train AI to play sims series?
"Congrats Peter, it&#39;s a great video with well deserved acclaim, its your first video and i dont think you could&#39;ve done better"
"Can you back up, what is the junk food containing historically scarce nutrients?"
YouTube premium with the screen locked makes listing to ai hard
Every movie before 2000 &quot;AI scary and evil!!&quot; ffwd 2023 &quot;So I taught my AI how to play pokemon&quot; lol love this planet
"Great video! It&#39;s fun to watch, and your voice is very comforting! ‚ù§"
Fantastic work.  Superb.<br><br>I can&#39;t wait for the day until the AI creates a model to train us.
"10/10, well done! Great to see people keep raising the Pokemon AI bar and doing so in such a well explained manner. Projects like this inspire me to actually finish my own!<br><br>I&#39;ve got more questions (and a few suggestions) than can reasonably fit in a comment, but I&#39;ll be sure to make an issue or 2 on the repo if I have time. In the meantime, keep up the good work!"
I would love to see how many shiny pokemon were caught during the making of this video
I wonder if linus media group would be intrested in taking one for the team and letting this play on some 128 core cpus and tb memory banks i want to see a full playthru and eventualy optmized ai speed run. I know my best time was only 13 hours start to finish as a kid
My only problem is watching it rename them for no reason üòÇ that aaaaaaaaaaa got me on edge leave that shit alone the pokemon will thank you come time to take the record at the elite 4.
Do you want Skynet? Because this is how you get Skynet
"Have you thought of adding a time element? Giving the AI the incentive to score more points, in a shorter time, would minimise the ‚Äúwandering around‚Äù within the game."
"ya but does the AI feel what we felt? no.<br>did the AI watch the anime like we did? no.<br>in yellow version did the AI look for a way to torture pickchu into getting stronger in Brocks town like in the show? no.<br>did the AI ever secretly want to marry Misty when they were in 2nd grade? no.<br>did the AI ever put its pokemon in the box and not understand what happened like us when we were kids? well.... yeah...<br>BUT THATS NOT THE POINT! <br>the point is... uh... make the ai watch the anime... or something? <br>idk,  i dont really have a point, i guess."
If only it could learn from our Previous save files
AI NPC battles are about to be wild üòÇ
Yea but which eevee evolution did dude make?
"Frankly amazing, earned a sub. Would like to see more from different games too"
You are really reaching for some of these bullshit comparisons lol
This is awesome! I wonder how much faster it train on a gpu cluster.
This is amazing
"Lol, hey Peter. How&#39;s it going? üòÖüòÇ"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=12m24s"">12:24</a> add a reward if it tryst a new move on a pokemon this lets it scan for types then a reward every time it gets a super effective message throw out misses and now it learns type advantage üòä"
Talk about chewing the scenery üòÜ
"Cool,!"
One of the most amazing videos I‚Äôve ever seen. I loved how you incorporated how humans learn to AI. Really opened my eyes. Subscribed and keep up the good work!!
WANT FULL GAME COMPLETED BY AI
"So what you&#39;re telling me, is this AI you&#39;re using, can train the same way Naruto can with clones? <br><br><br><br>Neat."
From Pokemon to harvesting mankind for fuel; they grow up so fast...<br><br>I just wanted to add that i really like how this was formatted. All the AI on screen at once reminds me of an ant farm. Inspired choice.
Do we know why it picked Squirtle?
My favorite part is when the first bot that went into mount moon just gave up as soon as it walked in Lmaoooo
"Knowledge is valuable your work, strategies here will probbaly be exploited for personal gain and the vaule of your work will not be rewarded or acknowledge how&#39;d you like compare to someone with more leverage then you. becareful what you give the world for public geniuses are always exploited"
God damn it it‚Äôs a fucking multiverse
This is the next evolution of Twitch plays. Chat could vote to decide on the reward structure and game restarts.
I wonder if the evil nintendo lawyers will strike this down
"Echoing what so many have already written here, but the amount of work gone into this has not gone unnoticed. So many well executed components from the work you&#39;re doing, the video editing, the storytelling, the education, the fun. All top tier. Oh and who doesn&#39;t like graphs and metrics?! So many skills learned... well done... and shared... thank you. Excellent work."
"I really love experiments like this. Id be interested to see the AI play something else, like the OG Legend of Zelda for example."
This kid will do great things!!
This is an incredible experiment and resulting video
"&quot;the great hackening&quot; üòÇcan defo relate. Awesome video Peter, thank you for sharing!"
"So this is how Skynet happens, it wants to exterminate all humans to create a world of pokemon."
"This is just amazing, I hope you can make this into a series until game completion"
The cringe way u act like its sentient. It&#39;s literally a computation. ü§°
"Natural selection at play, still Bee Queen or Ant Queen In real life functions more effectively"
instant sub! Great work on this video. I&#39;m sure you upset the AI when you called Magikarp a &quot;trash pokemon&quot; though :D
"amazing work bud, this is an awesome teaching resource and will be using it in class :)"
+ rare candy
so this with oldschool runescape please
Imagine the horror the Villagers faced when their village was flooded with thousands clone of the player that just walk randomly and enter every house.
How well does the ai handle the next game if you allow it to keep what it previously knows?
"For a blind amnisiac, your model did pretty good!"
"I&#39;m only half way through but i just wanted to say, this is one of the most entertaining ML videos I&#39;ve seen, you have an excellent knack for balancing educational elements (like the misaligned reward function example with junk food) and entertainment, I&#39;m absolutely stunned that this is your first video and i thoroughly look forward to seeing what you make next!"
Yet a 7 year old 90s kid can play through once and beast. We&#39;re supposed to be replaced y
Sky net began with Pok√©mon who knew
Awesome video. Very original idea. And the explanation of what&#39;s happening was top notch. A++ for this.
I didn&#39;t know pyboy existed. Thank you for this. I&#39;ve wanted to do something like this with various games many times but didn&#39;t know how to interact with the game itself. This helps a lot in seeing an actual implementation.
One of my favorite YouTube Videos of the year
"bro,i want to be you xD<br>I feel tons of nostalgy seeing this game.... there was a time when this game was eveithing for me &lt;3"
"This is insane, great work, great video"
ü§© WOW!  Can‚Äôt wait to watch anything you upload next!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=17m24s"">17:24</a> I used to play Diablo 2 as a kid religiously.  Im talkin multiple 99&#39;s ect.  Edges were literally the way to find the fastest path in a game that the map is procedurally generated everytime you enter a new game, and youre trynna to a run in minutes before making a new game"
Did you ever feel a sense of satisfaction as you watched the AI slowly learning through this reinforcement? I feel like you could draw a lot of parallels between this way of learning in AI and the way we humans nuture our young.
So they play it like in MatrixüòÇ
Is this really your first video?
well done my guy
"I appreciate the in depth detail of the coding. But a small brain man child like myself would also like to see a continuation of what this AI decides to do with the rest of the game. I have subscribed, sent this to multiple people and outlets and am interested in this. Thank you for your research."
Yup AI is taking over the world...üòÇ
The amount of effort and time for this video on a channel that relatively doesn&#39;t have that many subs is criminal. You deserve so much ad revenue for this
amazing video i ddont regret watching it
"If this video doesn&#39;t land you a job, I don&#39;t know anymore. Kudos for such a great production!!"
"300 days before the ai figures out how to beat the first gym, this is one of those metrics that people forget about ai learning, that is very long time, though simultaneously simulation does allow AI to live more lives at the same time."
awesome
I just want like 100000 or more ais that are exploring all of Kanto. Just like a 4 hour video of just a boat load of ais flowing over the world like a wave
These sounds remind me of my youth.
Meta-narrative is tremendous
The day we have super computers available to us all will open up a lot of doors to reinforcement learning and ai to the general public. Definitely waiting for results is the most frustrating part.
Lol... did you know you were colorblind before this video came out?<br><br>Everyone who&#39;s colorblind has got to learn some day I suppose. It must have been surprising to realize though.
This is pure horror actually.... Kids in their rooms are doing this.
I really would like to see a more detailed reward table AI Speed run :) -1 for every second passing ^^<br><br>And I am interested in how you did that in more detail. Those visualization of the AI inside the game is crazy :)
I wonder if you could give rewards for using super effective moves and possibly give negatives for not very effective moves. I also wonder if you could give it memory of encountered Pokemon and the ability to recognize move types. I have a feeling that without the ability to recognize those two things the model may be scared from using specific moves if you give negatives but I feel these two things would allow the model to evolve much faster.
you sound exactly like @JustinOdisho
i was kind of hoping we would see the AI beat the elite 4.
Love the objectivity.
Never thought I‚Äôd be learning life lessons at 27 years old from watching an A.I play Pok√©mon but here we are üòÇ
Incredible video. I learned a ton and was entertained at the same time. Very well done.
"This is what you call a FLEX, listen to his brain go, he probably doesn&#39;t even know how awesome this is , and Im not even a pokemon fan ,just a fan of sick adults üéâ"
train not just your pokemon but your AI mon!
This is truly brilliant and very well explained<br> <br>Run it until hall of fame pls
"Avoids conditions for trauma, stalls to avoid negative outcomes..<br><br>I think the AI became depressed. Or at least the aspects of depression that aren&#39;t related to emotion."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=12m31s"">12:31</a> Add +1 when super effective do -1 when not very effective¬ø"
"Won&#39;t catch me using anybody&#39;s cloud service for something like this, but I&#39;m happy somebody did. üôÇ<br><br>Much better to network a few devices together and take a few weeks or a month instead of a few days or whatever. Most of it&#39;s passive work anyway, and understanding how to network devices and split work up is an invaluable skill. Could even start <b>your own</b> cloud service! xD"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=6m54s"">6:54</a> the wiggle celebration after it&#39;s first victory... typical gamer move"
I watch this satisfied like a father‚ù§
"Actually both level and cheap pokemon reward rules can be replace by rewarding overall stat instead, because that is actually what the point of having good pokemon with high level, for more stat."
amazing
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=31m52s"">31:52</a> How do you exit vim?!?!?!<br><br><br>/s"
Great first video! Do you have another channel?<br><br>Edit: Seriously... How is this your first video?
How exactly do you know the file size of photos I take on my phone? Because webp.
"Love this lol I realized once you put it in levels for rewards it wasn&#39;t gonna work because the second it deposited one the level reward would be deducted. Now, I&#39;m not sure if this is what he did as I JUST made it to the spot where that level deduction was realized and now I wanna share my thought of what I think he&#39;ll put next before I see it lol I think it should work with the reward functioning off of how much EXP is gained, this in return should also help the battle problem as gaining XP would give it rewards and every time it loses a battle too harshly, no reward would be given as no XP would be gained. Will add the edit to determine if I was correct!<br><br>Edit: I wasn&#39;t right fully but I&#39;d say half XD As doing it off EXP would basically be the same thing as only level ups, gaining XP would only be going up. Not sure which would be better but it&#39;s a cool solution either one you do! Love the video!"
can your AI play with my coc?
The fact that AI develops a fear of Pokemon Centers sound like something that could happen to a small child.<br>Imagine going into that place and somehow losing your favourite pokemon because you&#39;re too young to understand what the PC does
By far the most impressive tutorial I&#39;ve seen. Thanks!
AI is literally a childüòÇ
It is THE WAY  MON
Interesting video. What I&#39;m more curious about is how do you have 35k subscribers and 3m views on this video after 10 days??
OMG THIS IS AMAZNG! i cant wait for AI E-sports!!!
"Congratulations, this video is perfect"
"Man, you should surely submit this to a high quality scientific magazine.... congratulations for your awesome work!üéâ"
You can tell how deep your understanding goes with how well it was edited. Great Video
Gosh... This is sooooo fascinating.<br>Thank you for having shared such a complex example
I think it‚Äôs funny that it got PTSD from depositing it‚Äôs pokemon
This is my Roman Empire
now do it with genetic algorithms
This is so cool. I wonder what would happen if you had the same ai play gold/silver after all that
This video is awesome! Well done mate!
Video of the year. As a competitive pokemon player this was incredibly engaging video
One of the most impressive videos ive ever seen. Great work!
"Music does change tone of a video, and using the old pokemon songs we all played was perfect, nostalgia made the video more catchy and interesting"
A really well-made video on a complex topic well-explained.
This is one of the greatest youtube video ever
Beautiful
"How did you create the Map with all the chars walking around simultaniously? Weird Question, I know."
wow
Superb content!
It&#39;s like a kid playing an English game while not understanding a word English. All they see is that they lost something. So they avoid it in the future.
What program is this
"Hmm, if only there were a computing device created by intelligence, that was infused with consciousness sparked by divinity.  Oh, hello you."
Do any of you guys having problems that the emulator won&#39;t open when run the ai?
Bet the AI doesn&#39;t name his rival AssFart
This is one of the best videos I&#39;ve vere seen about AI. Congrats!
Did the AI get all the pokemon
Excellent work sir! Really interesting to see how it all plays out!
üî•üî•
This is fucking great
"I really want to see a version of this video with other games but with a full playthrough to see how long it takes initially once the reinforced learning has been &quot;perfected&quot; and see how their times improve from generation to generation, great video though!"
What was the AI final team?
How long does a video like this take to make? Excellent work!!! Instant sub!
Nothing but respect for this video.. what the hell. Im astonished..
is there anyway to download someone else data that they ran on the learning command?
One of the best videos I ever watched on programming! That&#39;s amazing! I will enjoy on of this Reinforcement Learning with NFL to try simulate a game! haha
wow. you did a great job.
I just got into machine learning and seeing the behaviour learnt from an experiment like this is insane
brahhh this video was soooo goooood
Incroyable. Superbe vid√©o. ‚ù§
"Wow, I remember as a kid always running away from fights, and never connecting the dots that doing that is why I was always underleveled for the Elite 4! Also cool to see how the reward systems being followed leads to unexpected results. Kind of makes me think of how neurodivergent and neurotypical folks can be given the same information, and not understand how they understood it in totally different ways! Great video :)"
.
This project is mind-blowingly complex! It‚Äôs clear that a ton of hard work and knowledge from different fields has been mixed in. I‚Äôm seriously blown away by how amazing this is. I wonder if any LLM could implement into the gameplay or navigating
The AI&#39;s navigation on the game&#39;s surroundings reminds me an ant nest  :D they operate the same but with chemical info :D
It&#39;s hard to know why it follows this counter clockwise pattern<br><br><br>Right wall strats.
I am really curious to know how it will handle the puzzles in the game...
Extraordinary story telling and soo nostalgic to watch. Please make more videos!

"Instant sub, can‚Äôt even imagine how much effort did it require for such a condensed presentation. Impressive and inspiring!"
"Should have set the exploration function to trigger rewards for finding new route signs. That way, the AI is always trying to find the next area."
This is such a fascinating video
Impressive to watch the IA learning.. but kinda feel sorry ü§£

Can you train AI to play runescape and it won&#39;t detect it as a bot?
Now I just want to play Pokemon. Get missing No and all that.
I am not sure what your background is. But this project could easily be turned into a phd
How is this your first Youtube video?
"Interesting that it starts always with squirtle, is it the first option?"
Good video fun to watch!
Amazing. MOAH please!!!
Thank you for making this !!!
What makes it more interesting is that the Pokemon game developers time might not have an idea that by introducing missions who requires a return would someday in the future be stopping their game from an AI spoof üòÅ..
pokemon red n blue soundtrack is timeless
Wow! Bro so EPIC!
Great video!
"It&#39;s pretty mindblowing how the AI reacted to depositing the Pokemon in the Pokemon Center, avoiding it entirely because of the extreme negative association, despite the fact that the Pokemon Center itself wasn&#39;t the issue. It&#39;s exactly what happens when humans suffer extremely traumatic experiences, even if it&#39;s just once."
Damn this stuff blows my mind. I just cant understand or fully get my head around how this works and what an AI is or how it learns? its crazy.
What an amazing project! As a SW engineer one get completely terrified on what&#39;s coming and how much behind one is.
"How does the AI remember what Pok√©mon has?  Shouldn&#39;t its current Pok√©mon team and theirs stats be an input as well, like the screen?"
The completeness of this video is so impressive. Thanks for this as it&#39;s a great introduction for anyone new to RL and the space in general. I MIGHT just buy you a melt.
"Absolutely stellar work! While an interesting experiment, you&#39;re also sharing a lot of AI insights in a well articulated manner. The datadriven process is cool. I laughed when you discovered the AI was traumatized by loosing a pokemon and avoids the doctor, felt relatedable üòÇ And pondering on wtf to do with a Magikarp is what our child minds did too. Anyway, great work, great edit, well explained, educational: 10/10 A+üèÜ"
Beautiful
This is cool
"The ai might end up learning the battle mechanics better if you give reward points for supereffective damage, and take them away for resisted hits"
what if ai learn play ff7 on ps1 ? xD kinda very super interesting
Hell yes! This is the video the world needed! Good job!
I&#39;d be willing to contribute a gofundme or patron to see this project through the elite four
"Very interesting video, you explained the choices of your AI and your influencing of it very well so somebody like me (who knows nothing of it) could follow along.<br>Great job!"
"Nice <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>"
"What is the song that plays at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=14m48s"">14:48</a> ?"
what would happen if you load this agent in a game like sims or a command and conquerer??? the version that can complete pokemon game
This is really cool.
This is almost like naruto&#39;s bunshin training üòÖ
Now we just need a pokemon battle between AI and Twitch chat...
Insanely well done üëçüèª
"Nice! very cool, thanks for sharing"
"I really really enjoy this. The pacing. Patience in the explanation. This was cool, smart and cool."
"Damn that&#39;s more than a PhD Thesis, very well done"
Liquid gold for university course or lecture
This is truly a masterpiece sir. My respect. ü´°
I am so invested to see whether it could eventually beat the game
"It&#39;s interesting because Brock and Onix&#39;s whole deal is to teach the players about type matchups, that&#39;s why Onix has such miserable special stats but huge defence. So to see an AI work that out is like leaving your kid to figure it out and get to clap as they make the discovery!"
I need to see it completing the game
Excellent job here. I couldn&#39;t help but draw comparisons on this with how sperm find the egg. It&#39;s literally that which gets the furthest is most successful.
This was so fucking interesting I didn&#39;t notice the cheese based dish desktop background for ages.<br><br>(seriously this is beautifully done and for an idiot like me very understandable. I was gripped. I was so happy when the AI made it to the pokemon centre and the Lavender town music for the spooky points loss was Spielberg level genius. I assume this was a for Uni / College. Professor give this dude top marks and the rest of the week off from lectures.
fucking insane üòÆüòÆüòÆ
soo AI&gt;&gt;Fish&gt;&gt;Meüò¢
This is the senior project that I&#39;ve always wanted to doü•≤ but I graduated in 09 üòÇ
I hope you make more videos. This was wonderful to watch.
"This is not a good experiment. I think you are not smart enough. <br>No bad meaning, just the fact you did not see obvious things comming and your reward system also shows you did not know enough about Pokemon.<br>If you have learned more, than this experiment will run much smoother."
"¬øHave you tried to just use the actual game stats as the reward? Those are already designed to guide you throug the game, if all of them are at m√°ximum the game is concluded. for example:<br>- Pokedex data (number of pokemon viewed, catched...)<br>- Gym Medals<br>- Money<br>- Health and level of the pokemons in hand<br>- Number and value of objects in game<br><br>I also would add some of exploration reward but in other ways:<br>- Walking to new locations (not by image, difference, but by image flow. knowing which way you move and if the map moves in the direction you move is a reward).<br>- Movement speed (how much you move in a certain time) as a multiplier (would push the program to get the bike)<br>- New interacting (comparing the text of the interactions with other interactions you had).<br><br>Also I think exploration is already defined by the sats of the game, moving by itself is something every player tends to limit or reduce, so I think that there should be a reward for having a low walk-reward/total-reward ratio.<br><br>Idk, how do you feel it but for me its becoming addictive as i write to think about what made my young me to keep going with the game."
This is awesome want to learn more about how to start doing stuff like this myself. My question is the &quot;gentle rewards system&quot; implemented at the beginning. Would it confuse the AI if you added for example &quot;Catch Pokemon = 1 pt (unless unique than 2pts)&quot; or is that going to mess up the learning?
Nice video
"I wonder what the impact would be of making the reward points dynamic. For example, the value of training a pokemon starts off high, but has diminishing returns if the AI just stops and trains for a long period of time. The value would gradually go back to a full rewards status after a period of time."
I&#39;d love to compare the AIs against Twitch Plays Pokemon to see how much training the AIs would require to reach the same level as a player that inputs biased &quot;random&quot; inputs.<br>At least for the first few areas.
"This video is structured/written in a way that makes me confident you&#39;ll be incredibly capable at whatever you want to do in life. I hope you&#39;re having a happy day.<br>EDIT: If you&#39;re ever taking requests, I&#39;d be really interested to see how it tackles Chrono Trigger / Final Fantasy 6 + 7 / Duke Nukem 3D / Jedi Knight Dark Forces II üòÖ"
Thank you for this opportunity to both understand AI behavior and human decision making better. I often grow frustrated with neurotypical behavioral patterns when I see something as incredibly obvious because I can‚Äôt understand this rudimentary process
You have to try get it to beat the game now
"Well done Peter!! Incredible explanation for people like me who dont have background in this. PLEASE FINISH THOUGH, i want to see it beat the game"
"I tried to install this, but I failed. Noob problems. If someone has some extra time to help me: that would be lovely."
"&quot;Hunters gatherers blah blah blah fast food mumble mumble&quot;<br><br>Dude, getting the Magikarp is a fantastic play. It&#39;s a while until you get the old rod and 500 poke is chump change if you approach it as buying a future Gyarados.<br><br>I know it does it for different, much more simple reasons than to get Gyarados, but still. From a normal, human player&#39;s perspective, it&#39;s theoretically not a bad play at all."
"As a BS DS student, geez I appreciate so much the work you&#39;ve done with this! From the coding, presentation and story telling it&#39;s 11/10. Heavily comsci indeed üòÇ"
That video editing is top tier!
"Whaaaaaat lmao, this is soo fascinating"
"&quot;the later iterations are shown in red&quot; bruh, am I color blind...."
Excellent video breakdown on AI and some of the overlapping issues of human intelligence.
Unbelievable. Thank your for the amazing content.
"Great, now this Ai is going to spend its whole life playing Pokemon and disappointing its motherboard."
omg what&#39;s thisüòÆ
"Not sure if its been said already, but, I would love to see them beat the game. Then we can see what levels they got to and what they thought was the best pokemon to have for the elite 4. Would be interesting."
"Another interpretation of the model&#39;s self-sabotaging behavior is that when a measure becomes a metric, it ceases to be a good measure. (Goodhart&#39;s Law)"
Hey man this is a phenomenal video. Really hope you are able to make something similar to this moving forward.<br>Well done
dude uploads his first ever video and gets 2.6m views. sometimes the algorithm recognises good quality and just works perfectly :)
"Friggin&#39; awesome Peter, I&#39;m currently in my ML2 class and it can be quite daunting at times. This surely gave me a perk!"
"Super cool project! One thing that suprised me was that the agent didn&#39;t catch more pokemon, given that it would receive rewards every level gained. For every pokemon caught, it would mean a big chunk of reward, same as for when the agent decided to always buy the magicarp? I would imagine that the agent would try to catch a pokemon every chance it would get."
"very good video, thank you !"
"But wait, which starter Pok√©mon did the AI choose most often?"
"I want to suggest, instead of a threshold for the exploration reward; you give fractional rewards. If &quot;no pixels are the same, completely unique&quot;, a reward of 1 is given, but if only a tenth of them are unique, it gives a reward of 0.1; so reward scales from difference.<br>Also, unique coordinates might be a better thing to scale rewards off of if you&#39;re aiming for navigation... But that would likely require some more re-jigging."
üòäüòäüòä
Very cool video!
this is awesome
"I want to learn this sort of thing so badly, how do i learn more then extremely basic RL? bc this sort of project is awesome."
"wow, this is a damn good video."
"For the AI, the entire game was played in the dark, completely blind. Right? Or did it have a way to interpret its visual environment (beyond novelty)? Cool project, nice edits and storytelling!"
"Very well done video, concepts explained in a simple and concise way. I want congratulate you for expecially your patience and commitment, i&#39;m also working too in the same field and I know how frustrating the trial and error mechanism can be, especially when it requires a huge number of hours of execution. The way they visualized the data was also brilliant. Very good !!"
Maybe is hugging the outer walls of the map and moving clockwise or couter clockwise a way to see more new things - later a behavior that made the ai hug buildings or so
"This is very, very well done. Kudos to you, sir!"
"Hi, I&#39;m impressed by your video. It&#39;s really nice to watch your experiences, and you&#39;ve made me want to do something similar. Thank you for sharing this. Great job! How did you manage to learn these things? Hobby or job? For me, it&#39;s like black magic!"
"There are a few things that I think should be added to the reward tracking:<br>Reward for using a super-effective move<br>Penalty for using a not-very-effective move<br>Reward for taking a not-very-effective move<br>Penalty for taking a super-effective move<br><br>These would have to be weighted much less than actually winning the battle, but something like this would help situations like getting stuck at Brock.<br><br>Additionally, I&#39;d try to implement some rewards for using a Pokemon Center based on how much HP and PP was restored, to incentivize visiting the Pokemon Center when the team is very weak.<br><br>However, it might be harder than normal to track that, because Gen1&#39;s effectiveness check is bugged on dual types.  The damage is still calculated properly, but it only checks the first type for effectiveness."
"when a AI on a videogame acts smarter than most of the people i ever worked with<br><br><br>great video btw. <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>"
"Oh great, this is what they&#39;ll do to us when they take over."
your gameboy battery is dead
"Great video, I also always buy the Magikarp lol"
"This is gunna sound so stupid but I really wish the AI beat the game.<br>Otherwise, a perfect video:)"
Bro tryna make ww3 with ia ( we all know how it‚Äôs going to end )
it is beautiful
Is like watching Ants learning.
Very cool<br>Would have loved to see the AI play all the way through.
Incredible visualization and explanation
Great job dude!
Just watching millions of Trainer Reds tpose across dozens of screens is the highlight of my day.
Great stuff! Contents like this is why I watch Youtubeüòä
really nice
This is awesome. &quot;Catch &#39;em all&quot; was a missed opportunity for an objective though üòÇ.
"I have ADHD, and I&#39;m naturally impatient, aspceially with topics like these, but holy cow. The quality and editing of this, and not to mention the presentation is astounding! Very well done! I was able to follow along the whole thing!"
"It&#39;s like me when I was a sperm cell, I managed to finish the game"
"Amazing quality video, obviously took a long time to simulate, record, edit, script, etc. Bravo!"
"I have yet to finish the video, only at 14 minutes but I wonder, wouldn&#39;t you have better results if you program them to not avoid battle but  instead of taking off points for losing you take off points for losing life points, wonder if they would evolve to win in quicker ways"
"Walking Counter-Clockwise: Route 1 and Viridian Forest are build such that counter clockwise you get the most exploration in given time, as clockwise you would encounter more dead ends.<br>Same in Viridian City as clockwise you would went to Route 22 which is also a dead end  and dead end means -&gt; More steps needed for less exploration."
"I see a lot of possibilties, an immersive game that have sentiment NPCs or warfare"
Excellent work.
"I‚Äôve for years loved AI videos and this video, even as someone who always gets annoyed when everyone video re-explains reinforcement learning, neat, etc‚Ä¶ This video was really well paced and made overall, I hope you continue to make great videos like this!"
"In playing gsg like eu 4 victoria 3, romance of the three kingdoms (koei), nobunaga&#39;s ambition, you can play observe and let the ai play for you and recontrol it."
Hi how to get this Game in PC?<br><br>have any AI for Pokemon GO ???
This video actually looks like part of a thesis
Easy way to fix getting stuck would be to program a negative value like boredom in humans. Might encourage novel behavior
This is good ‚ù§
could google do this with our phones?
So much effort went into this great vid
"Now what I would be curious to see is if it would be possible to fine tune a Mulitmodal LLM to be similar to this, provide it bias for gameboy controls or Pok√©mon knowledge, and see how much better it would begin to navigate through any better with the transfer learning from the LLM. The short term memory would still work but as a conversation length max, popping the older prompts/results."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m15s"">4:15</a> dude how is ur gamboy running without batterie lamp on. do we have a zoomer here again, who never played the game?"
Now make it do nuzlockeüòÇ
I&#39;ll remember your name. See you and the team in the next 10 years. Awesome content!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=15m34s"">15:34</a><br>AI went dumb"
You can get any job in tech with this video
For the going back to pallet town issue you could add a point for collecting the pokedex
not me feeling bad for the AI when he lost 13 points. Hurt my guy deeply
"This was super cool and informative, not to mention very well made. Thanks for sharing it."
Now do Resident Evil. I wanna watch AI fight zombies lol
Algorithm suggested it. What a killer first video.
"the ai thing is very cool by itself but what really makes this impressive is the visualizations, i wonder how you did that, recording the location values from memory?"
"The amount of dedication and time put to work here is astounding, awesome work"
"This ia really amazing, I love it, I&#39;m going to play around with it in my weekend. <br><br>Thanks for sharing your hard work ‚ù§"
"Bro comes onto Youtube droppin&#39; a banger of a video, immediately goes viral and gets 33k subs in 10 days."
Repent to Jesus Christ ‚ÄúLook to the Lord and his strength; seek his face always.‚Äù<br>‚Ä≠‚Ä≠1 Chronicles‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠16‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠11‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NIV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨
This is one of the best videos on this website.
"Fuckin gnarly stuff. Cool information, love it."
"This was a great watch. Thank you for this content! I wanted to ask you about the applications of this policy learning, and how it may stretch to outside the gaming ecosystem? Thanks again!"
after that first trainer battle <b>Happy AI noise</b>
It would be curious to see how the AI figures out how to catch Mewtwo without a master ball. This is insanely awesome! Well done!!!
"Is there a finished run with no interruptions or commentary? Currently <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=11m30s"">11:30</a> in"
I&#39;d love to see this AI try to beat the whole game with it&#39;s learning experiences
Not the AI getting traumatized by the Pokecenter üòÇüòÇ
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=3m35s"">3:35</a> This is both hilarious and intriguing! It&#39;s intriguing because basically the AI chose to just become a regular npc. XD<br>Don&#39;t forget that those other two npc are also AIs as well, they can walk virtually all over Pallet town, but they tend to remain where the AI you&#39;re training is, it leaves me to wonder if the same paradox that&#39;s happening to it also already exists in Pokemon&#39;s npcs."
this was outstanding. would really love to see you go further with this (and i hope other people will agree when i say i want more technical stuff too)
How did you do all the cool visualizations? :)
I really need more videos like this one! ‚ù§
"2.5m views and its his first video, talk about hitting the jackpot"
Awesome vid - would love to see a full vid of an AI going all the way to become champion.
Hey man I always buy the magikarp having a gyarados in the early game is awesome.
do elden ring next
Really enjoyed seeing your thought process throughout the project! It&#39;s an exceptional feat to make something fairly technical into an entertaining video that keeps people hooked for over 30 minutes. Looking forward to the next one!
Excellent work of art. Very relatable as a life long Pok√©mon fan. This sparked my interest in diving deeper into the subject.
lol 1 easy way to save some money on training AI is applaying a reward function on The Law of Least Effort ü§£
AMAZING video! it was just nonstop education and fun! I&#39;m trying this
Awesome video. Has anyone forked it yet to make a GPU version of the training?
"Hey Peter, this is stunning. Did you build everything ground up?"
Bruh I hate smart people making everyone else look bad by doing smart people shit
Could you have the ai change its rewards system to see what point system can be the one whos (highest total) is reached in the (shortest time)
This is by far one of the highest quality videos I&#39;ve seen on RL. I am also a Youtuber who makes fun AI projects from time to time (e.g. use of AI in Kpop). You sir have just inspired me to hop back onto YT and make more videos :)
unbelievably well made
One of the coolest videos I‚Äôve ever seen.
"Ok, so two things:<br>First, in a sense AI avoiding PC as death make it more clever than twitch play Pok√©mon. <br>Second: The best Pok√©mon is the water type and not the grass type, as demonstrated here."
I feel like this is what aliens did when they made us
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=20m40s"">20:40</a> alright, I didn&#39;t expect to stay so intrigued for this long."
Man this was such an interesting video to watch.. im learning the world of programming and so far wasn&#39;t interested in it but still kept going .. but seeing this video it made an impact that i should definitely try it for myself in order to learn and have fun.. especially on how the AI behaves that was super interesting<br>So to whoever made this or the group of people that made this YOU GUYS DID AN EXCELLENT JOB.. i can just imagine how hard it is to make this and man how satisfying it is to be doing something greatl like this
Alright someone send me the live stream of this where it‚Äôs beating the game
"We&#39;re watching a digital experiment. The Ai is living life in a digital reality ( or from its perspective, just normal reality)"
Everybody gangsta til‚Äò the trainer turns into blue shirt guy
"The AI&#39;s struggle with Brock due to it relying on what it knew reminded me of my own first playthrough. I picked Charmander, and since bugs were weak to ember, I relied on it too much. I couldn&#39;t seem to beat him until I eventually started over and picked Bulbasaur"
What really blows my mind is how AI projects like this extract such exquisite visual data.
"So why not take the pokemon AI and put it in a different game to let it learn even more? I know i learned how to play games by playing a lot of them, so i wonder what would happen if you take the pokemon ai and drop it into metroid, then galaga, then maybe bring it up a notch into goal/plot driven games"
The individual runs look a lot like twitch plays Pok√©mon actionüòÇ
Watched the whole thing I didn&#39;t feel the time passing...
"Ok now i need to see full potencial, reach the final and win everything, and finally see an optimized full run with reward over time and see how the AI ‚Äã‚Äãmanages to win the cup in the shortest time possible &lt;3 THIS IS CONTENT!!!"
Very enjoyable and informative video in many aspects!
Could this help?  sending the ram buffer every 5 seconds or so to a model trained on those values and what they mean in a game?
Awesome video ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
How can I watch more of this?
this reminds me of when i first played yellow version without knowing any english and training my pikachu to level 30 to beat onix lol
Would be interesting to see how much faster it learns with a quick rewind button
YOU MISSED THE MIST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT POKEMON.<br>Use this machine learning algorithm to see which starter it gravitates towards for it&#39;s playthrough. End the debate once and for all.
idk if I&#39;m more impressed by the ai training or how you figured out how to edit this video
Congrtulations you have managed to speed run youtube
"yo how tf you make pokemon philosophically impactful tho?? this shit is legitimately S-tier content.<br>does this mean that moving forward, we&#39;ll need to have separate rankings for human and AI speedrunners, with AI setting the standard completion times for each game?"
"excellent video essay dude, love the human touch you brought to this subject‚Äîit‚Äôs a thing that‚Äôs really easy to make sound trite and you did an excellent job in presenting the subject of AI as inseparable from what it tells us about people. I admire this video a lot!!"
Not the fly trap üòÇ
This is incredible. Pretty amazing what machine learning with proper training is capable of.
AI gaming vs Betta Fish gaming please!!!!!
damn man... i play pretty much the same way as a kid. am i an ai and i just dont know it?
you want Skynet? because this is how you get Skynet
thanks
AI for University admin &#39;24!
I&#39;d be able to code if I was taught it through Pokemon! love this!! ü§óü§óüòç make classes off of this
Yeah but can it Nuzlocke?
I wish one of my dads was Peter Whidden. Great video!
"hey dude. I hope you will tune down the music a bit for the next vid, or at the very least  tune up your voice :D"
Amazing! Just amazing!
"You sir have inspired me to begin my own AI pokemon Engine! I didn&#39;t know this was something I&#39;ve always wanted to do until i watched this, now i understand this feeling üòÅ<br>My spin (because I don&#39;t want to just steal your idea) is training it for obscene pokemon challenges.<br>You have been an inspiration today. I just want you to know that and i hope you read this üòÅ"
Unbelievable video man your so talented!!
Straight up made a shadow clone version of learning. Thanks sensei
No elite 4?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=3m41s"">3:41</a> AI wasn&#39;t distracted it did what all of us always do when we find a exploit to get the highest reward with least effort your the one to blame for creating a easily exploitable reward system kek."
"Amazing video and visualization, i learn a lot, waiting for next one"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=9m30s"">9:30</a> no that&#39;s so sad üò≠"
elon musk: told ya
Naruto learning Rasenshuriken be like
You need to give points for speed too for defending a gym leader
haha the left one at the start reminds me of myself starring at the wall good old times
"Wow, what an amazing video. I grew up playing Pokemon and seeing being used to illustrate a complex &quot;magical&quot; technology such as reinforcement learning is quite the treat."
My dude got alot of time
2.5 million in 10 days. Did it without a feature
Yea this was me when I was a kid: gets red version picks squirtle üòë
"The AI was lost. Like a father figure, Peter had guided the AI to greater things. The AI became scared, but was promptly aided. Every time the AI fell, it was picked up, but still given its own direction. Remarkable.<br><br>I am a brick layer, not a tech savvy sort. But I have a great appreciation and respect for this. People today are lacking introspection. Lacking strong parental figures. Guidance. They seek that immediate gratification the AI had at the start and go nowhere. No one to say there‚Äôs more out there. This in the realm of people is often drugs. Self detrimental effects. It is scary how similar I see this AI to people around me and even myself."
Damn dude. You set the bar high for your first video!
5 years of develpment? THAT&#39;S CRAZYYY!!!
"I would  be impressed if the IA didn&#39;t know then rules of the game itself, like, if it had to find by itself what was more important, like catching a pokemon or winning a gym, and not you to set that."
Bro wins the internet with one single video ! That video actually scares me to what AI is possible insane work my friend !
&quot;Fight rat&quot; üòÇ
"Truely Brilliant as it gets into more details. Could you do some videos to explain/teach the steps about how to train an ai? the tools needed etc. Keep up w the good work, not everyone has 2.5M vues on its first youtube video... :))"
"I&#39;m in a similar position myself ( AI hobbyist ) and part of my present predicament runs thus : catching my tech-naive friends and family up on industry lingo / practical examples so that they can better appreciate the ACTUAL wizardry ( and expense ! ) which goes into building sophisticated AI models .<br><br>As the old adage goes : something given has no value ; <i>especially</i> if it is not properly explained !<br><br>Now, I can simply refer them to your outstanding presentation instead ; what a time saver !<br><br>TY and bravo, sir ."
POV: Teacher tells student to work on the high school senior project before graduation. Student then proceeds cultivate complex AI behavior and writes an analysis comparing it to human behavior.
This is brilliant sir. I&#39;m currently in Bachelors for machine learning / AI and this reminds me exactly why I need to keep going lol
more quickly? you lost me when you said that.
Should make ai try finish this game I&#39;ll sub if you do üéâ
How do you give the AI access to game?
&quot;at one point it managed to break the game&quot;<br><br>as did we all...
this is exactly how I did it when I was 11.
"Can you please please please train an Ai to play Killer Instinct arcade  version, that would be amazing!!!!! Not sure how feasible that is."
Why does this remind me of a crowd in rollercoaster tycoon
"Great video all around keep it up! I definitely would not want to run much ML on cloud it gets expensive fast, cheaper in the long wrong to just built a pc for it."
"Dang dude I would have sat here and watched an entire AI gameplay, happily. Really well done video"
The little dance after beating the first trainer got me
My man just got bank from his first uploadü§ë
Que video bom pqp
"I&#39;m about half way through, but ideas are a buzzing!<br><br>Other reinforcers:<br><br>- include Pokedex completion as reward, in addition to level increase. That should avoid punishment when depositing.<br><br>- include rewards for keeping Pokemon alive and HP high. Can&#39;t remember if red has it, but think there&#39;s an affection variable per Pokemon. If it can track that, that would be great.<br><br>- incentives for beating trainers, gym Leaders and of course... Gary (I&#39;d include publishing for Gary too)!<br><br>- reward for money earned would be great, but less than using and buying necessary items <br><br>- something to encourage info gathering /socialisation. Only on the first try though to avoid spamming.<br><br>- reward for healing Pokemon<br><br>- a time variable too. Items like the running<br><br>If there was a way to program/learn ABC data as well that would be great. Learning that Pokemon appear only in tall grass got instance. Or water Pokemon are only seen after the use of the rod. Or even learning what the next tile represents (barrier, path, interaction etc.) A function that addresses the 9 squared tile type would clarify what each represents. This would be essential if there was a time variable too."
Just... Awesome ü§Øü§Ø
"I wanted to comment on the music. The reverb made it sound... distant, but in a good way. It was like actually listening to my memories of the past playing this game as a kid, and I felt a wave of nostalgia. Was this your intention with the reverb?"
Thank you ü¶æ
Awesome video. It brought me good memories also. Thank you for share. Keep up the channel!
Cant wait for more love to watch the hole game play through ‚ù§
This is so cool man well done
"I&#39;m ready for part II, finishing the game!  Great job btw, excellent video."
Wow. You don‚Äôt even know how groundbreaking this video will be to future generations. Amazing work
When a program made by man. Acts like such.<br><br>Imagine.
I want to see an AI descend into hopeless microtransactions addiction
Why do some of the AIs just stop?  Like the first one in mount moon walked in by the sign and just stopped there.  Did it ever start moving again?
"Hmm I wonder what would change if you added one point reward for healing pokemon beyond certain level. ie if very little or none was healed, no points."
AI will soon be training you.
"I wonder if the AI will learn type advantages/disadvantages if there were rewards for using an effective move and penalties for using ineffective moves.<br>Rather, how well will it learn typings."
great work
Not pressing after losing a Pokemon battle to avoid -1 reward is my kinda level of petty üòÇ
Stop cheating
"Damn this was very inspiring. Although I can program I had no real clue how AI actually trains itself. This was very insightful and I had several ideas how you could maybe improve the algorithm to make the AI even better. Thank you very much, I will try my luck with that!"
Keep making great content like this. This was informative and well put together.
You created a masterpiece.
How much would the ai improve if it could read or comprehend the sentence in game
video audio sux :(
Not gonna lie would have loved to see this go all the way and also if they could choose the starter.
This was broken down brilliantly. Great video
This level of edit made me think about the whole point of my life.
??? : RED MUST DIE
"I noticed at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=17m20s"">17:20</a> you mentioned you were unsure of why it chose to move in a single direction with limited memory. When I was a firefighter, we used a method of keeping our right or left hand on a wall while searching smoke-filled buildings. The method that AI used is more or less the same method and my hypothesis is that it learned it could discover new areas more easily by utilizing this technique which triggered more reward points at a faster rate."
"Excellent work, really enjoyed watching this and would love to see more about the AI progress and any additional quirky things you saw during training! Even as a tech layman the technical half of the video was really well done."
You autistic?
What an absolute banger of a video
I beat red in a year at 7 years old how come the ai can‚Äôt beat it in 5 years with learning 20 thousand times faster is it because ai can only learn through trial and error and humans have so many more ways to take in and process information?
&lt;3
Amazing vid!
"Awesome vid. I noticed you commonly personify the AI using terms like it gets satisfied, and it likes to do this. Is this just a habit of speech or do you believe the AI should be regarded in a human capacity?"
"This is beautifully done, and allows us to better understand ourselves and how we learn by using AI."
Bro your comparisons of AI and Human behaviors üò´üëå
"Turns on the AI is just like us, and loved beauty and hates the trauma of losing your Pok√©mon"
"Super impressed,  great job. We need more videos like this :D<br>One suggestion, what if at the start of the game, you program the AI to understand how the game works. Meaning which button does what and create a base. Comparing the results of this vs new version could show the speed in which AI can learn depending on pre-training."
"Well that&#39;s got my subscription. The idea was cool but not something I know much about. Yet you presented it in an easy to understand way without sounding like you were talking to a kid. Great edit if it&#39;s you, I look forward to your next video."
wtf
"this video is wierdly soothing for me, thank you for this!"
Exactly how many Zubats were slaughtered to make it through Mt Moon?
This is your first video? Oh my god ü§Ø
you could also in theory develop a variation of this where you can use a diffusion model to maybe optimize the inital path selection? or maybe even try to do it by using a poisson flow generation model to get a whole bunch of rewarded routes (including trainer fights) then optimize for rng of pokemon catching and then from there updating your reward function to catch pokemon like you have
should have given it access to the internet and made it learn on it&#39;s own
Absolutely Impressive how you have done all of it Respekt ‚úä ( Also when i absolutely not a fan of AI ) Was nice too look
Straight up Naruto learning rasenshurikan
One video 9 days ago at 2 mill views lol congrats on the life change all the time spent was well worth
"I have no clue how hard it would be to set up, but if you swap the reward for exploring to a reward for a unique interaction, it might encourage the ai to try out different menus, interaction with npc&#39;s, items and strategies when combined with a negative reward for fainting pokemon. Loved the video, super interesting"
This is also how naruto learned.
"I am not a coder, but I am constantly fascinated by what y‚Äôall can accomplish, especially with AI. I played this game as a kid 22 years ago, and find this video very interesting and nostalgic at the same time, great video!"
Love how similar the AI plays to Twitch Plays Pokemon lol
Very interesting content and well presented too. Do you think maybe adding a reward to dealing high amounts of damage with a single move would help the AI learn to select the correct moves in combat?
"Kind of offended by the junk Pokemon explanation. Garydos is king, show some respect! Lmfao thank you for this, it was fun and very interesting. I‚Äôll check out your channel being a first timer. Cheers"
I find it wholesome seing 20 thousand Reds trying to conquer Kanto together !
"To avoid the stuck on one area surrounded by other already known areas have you considered the idea of give a negative reward after a long time in the same area?<br>I think this would force the ai also to improve battle skills in order to lose less time in that scene and maybe it could make possible a necessary backtracking if needed.<br><br>I haven&#39;t seen the code, so it may be something you already done.<br>Anyway, great work! The video is beautiful and i&#39;ve appreciated parallelisms with human behavior."
I‚Äôm not kidding when I say this might be the most important video I‚Äôve ever watched on YouTube
This is beautiful!!!!
please more of that!
"Can you use an if then reward statement to fix the ai getting stuck. Like: if no reward granted after x time, then force movement in non explored direction?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=8m45s"">8:45</a> AI got PTSD from depositing a Pokemon in Pokemon Center üòÇ"
Great job in this!! Literally like a bunch of mice after cheese in a lab lol. <br>So cool though man.
"Very interesting and impressive, but some of the comparisons to human behavior are a reach... like equating buying a magikarp to buying fast food; fast food ultimately does help humans with the &quot;original objective&quot; of survival but buying magikarp does not help progress the game"
great video
NEED MOAR!
Im so proud of the little early game guys that made it look easy even for the midle guys. (I  coment as i watch im sorry
it needs to give rare candies to the magikarp
First of all extremely good video! I have a question for you @Peter Whidden. What is your background and where did you learn this all?
"I love this kind of video but I couldn&#39;t watch this video without thinking all the time: &quot;Damn, this needs so much effort ü§Ø&quot;. Programming, executing and documenting takes a lot of time and effort anyway, but so does preparing such an excellent video. Kudos! üëè"
Would love to see this AI learn to play ‚ÄúFear &amp; Hunger‚Äù üòÇ
"Much respect, never played the game.. but I understand the effort. Thank you, hopefully more people have this level of commitment in the upcoming generations"
This is a game that is a generational experience to all Y gens. It was heart warming to see you taking so much time to write a learning model to master the game. I&#39;d predict that the chance for the AI to catch mewtwo is close to 0%. It is also damn hard to finish the indigo league. I&#39;m curious how long it would take it though.
Brocks red sprite thoughüíÄ
rewarding the a.i.?  Don&#39;t you just mean a simple &quot;IF&quot; line in code that checks and increases a number variable if its a new screen?  This doesn&#39;t entice or reward the a.i.....  It doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s doing anything at all. Only a number variable is increasing from a line of text.    : /   Just a bit weird to assume a program has feelings when its just a simple +1 line of code.
"Have you thought about making the rewards so that they diminish over time, so that it hurries up? Like, -.01 reward per minute?"
"First video million views, what a great project!!"
Now how do we turn this AI into skynet?
This is very valuable research and should be studied by AI developers.
"2,4 Million views in 10 Days with the first video - deserved. Well done!"
Youre telling me that the AI seeing a pokemon center triggers its PTSD of accidentally losing his Pidgeotto?!
Have you tried making it play against a clock?
I did the pikachu face several times during the life lessons. Junk food is the same as buying magicarp?! Why didn&#39;t I see this before?!
I am wondering that having a global position and rewarding a global position change is more efficient than pixel diff.
Was hoping it would play the whole game
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=05m32s"">05:32</a> interesting how the AI seems to name all of its Pok√©mon AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
"Great video, learned something new AND also had the exciting opportunity to root for a computer that learns to use bubble vs. geodude"
"I did not get what the agent version means, would really appreciate if somebody explain it to me :)"
Its like leaving food on the ground and watching an army of ants go for it
You should go get your PhD. Not kidding.
Absolutly amazing.
"Nice video, i would like to know hoy many people worked on this project, the envirnment where u trained the IA (like cpu, vga, etc). And how much time you spent on this project. Thanks a lot for the video and congratz!!"
"Hoooly<br>The vid after 7 minute, in Viridian Forest, reminded me of ants<br>Movement of ants from an ants&#39; nest, ants as AI learning the world :D"
You hit me in my feelings with this and blow my mind at the same time! What a video man!!!‚ù§
wooow great insight im currently starting a masters in AI and machine learning so thanks for the intro hahaha GREAT JOB
Subscribed in the hopes that this becomes a series. Want to see it beat the Elite 4 and somehow magically go find a beat Red! That would be super impressive
"The Pallet Town Problem is actually fascinating. Does the AI getting stuck in the novelty loop emulate humans because it was built by human intelligence, or do humans getting stuck in the novelty loop indicate a base flaw in intelligence overall?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=14m39s"">14:39</a> that sounds like bullshit you made on the spot."
"Amazing video, you are truly talented. First time i ever enjoyed learning about programming"
"I am curious about some things, wouldn&#39;t making the rewards &#39;unique items&#39; and &#39;unique pokemons&#39; acquired be better than exploration? This would incentive exploration, leveling and quest completion, no? Although, eventually, it would probably stop at the last evolution and not level anymore.<br>Not a programmer, just a casual gamer."
I wonder if it would be possible to simulate the world using an AI with a quantum computer
"Well made, I would be interested in the Ai&#39;s final team choice by end of game."
Wow
"Its scary to think that the AI could be as aware and as sentient as us, except all it knows it Red Version"
"An update you can do is go give rewards for using super effective moves and give neutral or a tiny punishment when they use a move that is not effective, that should eventually make the AI want to use powerful moves primarily"
It looks more like brute force than AI.
Really cool! Thanks for sharing this.
this is beyond amazing
Great video! Love the human references
"This is fascinating, I&#39;d love to watch more"
The video is really good! I do disagree with the fast food statement though. I think timse/efficiency as well as money motivates humans to fast food equally as much if not more. Also advertising and conditioning doesn&#39;t help.
this ai is like a animal .... it needs to be able to read and understand those words or something.<br>nice work!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=17m10s"">17:10</a>, it&#39;s called the &quot;hand on the wall&quot; method if you keep your hand on the right side of the wall, you can escape any maze so long as you&#39;re not touching an island."
"The accidental traumatic depositing of Pok√©mon in the center is rather hilarious, and the Magikarp/fast food analogy is beautiful. Picking left is an ancient gaming trick, not surprised AI picked it up/that we make games that reward it. And lastly the short-term memory bit seems to me a great idea to solve this (and also, accidentally, rather human :P)."
Idk the point system appears to be unreasonable at first glance.  Catching a pokemon and winning a battle is so much easier and repeatable as opposed to winning a gym.
"I got to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m30s"">4:30</a> then realized continuing the video was pointless. I‚Äôm happy you created the content. Best of luck."
I would love to see the AI beat the game
"Ez sub, Great video"
I absolutely loved this and would love to see more AI training.
We are in a simulation now
"The AI turns left the same reason many d&amp;d players do. The world thinks right handed, so the correct path usually is to the right. So with the A.I. it is rewarded for novelty, which means it finds more dead ends and areas that are not required, so therefore novelty"
Bro I have to comment just in the hopes you get a couple cents on that $1000 back
"Damn ... very good video. Really interesting, too. I didn&#39;t expect it, to be so expensive though. Would love to know see more of it. If it wouldn&#39;t be so expensive, you could take this model, let it play completely through pokemon red and let it play one game after the other. It would be so interesting to see, how a Pokemon red trained AI-model would play pokemon yellow for example and then pokemon silver. This could be a complete series. I would watch it."
This is so beautiful ‚ù§. I remembered when I was just a little boy learning how to play this game ü•π
Looks like Ants! Love it.
AI: <b>deposits Pok√©mon</b><br>Also AI: WHY GOD WHY! MY POK√âMON!
still dont understand how you reward an a.i
"Very impressive work. New challenge, write it in a REAL programming language like Rust or C++."
This video was fantastic. I loved the Magikarp= junk food analogy
How is the only video on your channel a proper work of art? Incredible work
great job dude. great job!
"I went to watch your vidoes just to discover u don&#39;t have any. This was so good. Keep at it, cant wait for more of your content"
wow...
There&#39;s one still looking at hometown&#39;s lake üòÇ
Finally someone who teaches us something important... I subbed .. please increase my knowledge more ‚ù§
AI is like a love letter from humans to the existence itself. You have wonderfully annotated important contrasts and similarities between AI and real world. Possibly the best youtube video I have watched in 2023. I&#39;d love to learn more about how to actually do/implement this from a noob level to your level. sure you&#39;ve covered the basics but I mean the boring code stuff
This is quality content
I&#39;d like to one day see something like this with the original Fallout games
Maybe now we can finally learn how to catch mew.
"I work in the field of clinical neuropsychology, and have a fair bit of background knowledge of predictive processing. As far as i can tell, this is by far the best and most intertaining illustration of many of the central principles of machine learning and cognitive psychology, two sciences i love. Thank you!"
I want to see twitch plays pokemon vs AI
Ahhhh i want more!!!! I want to see it becomming Pokemom Champ
"Brother, I respect the hustle so much. Your first video - gz!"
this is a very nice
How might you learn more optimal reward scoring with this? Perhaps some higher level reward (time until 1st gym battle win) to dial in a more optimal reward system?
How&#39;s this your first video and it&#39;s gone viral?
Very interesting and well made video
Is that Linux<br>I didn‚Äôt pay much attention at the beginning but I think I saw Linux
This video is insane I have no idea how you made this great work
I mean someone had to do it! great job!
1 Cookie for you.
Oh God! You have the robot PTSD!?
It dident beat the game?
i cant wait for part 2. amazing job
Insanely high quality content! Love all your references to how humans behave such as the junk food metaphor!
I‚Äôm at the part where the AI luckily defeats Brock. I can‚Äôt help but wonder what would the AI do if it started with a more challenging starter Pok√©mon like charmander?
I think its really funny how you find the issues and fix them with rewards and stuff. Reminds me of tweaking and questioning the reports I&#39;m given. Under scrutiny some of these reports can be modified to show a more useful value.
"Love this video. Entertaining and easy to follow along. <br>Now I might try to use DreamerV3 to see if I can set a lap time on the Slim-Line Slits track in the GameCube game F-Zero GX, the hardest track in any racing game ever."
Thank you so much for this!
"As someone who first played this game as a 4 year old and mastered it before the age of 10, watching ai trying to figure it out just like we had to in the late 90s is truly fascinating."
The Kid&#39;s got Mad skillsüòÇ
Followed u because u need to get paid to do this ü´∂üèª
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=16m04s"">16:04</a> dude, this... what the hell. Made me feel like I am in some gameboy pokemon movie"
"Absolutely insane video, great stuff!"
I may have missed something but how did the AI deal with oaks parcel?<br><br>Great video!!<br><br>I should have waited till the end of the video sorry!
"Not sure if you (or anyone else that might know the answer) will see this comment, but when you showed all the AIs making their way through the game with the later AIs coloured in red, i noticed a lot of them went into the pokemon center, a handful of them went into the mart, but none of them went into the house. Now as players of the game we know the house has no use, but i cant figure out why, given the &#39;point&#39; criteria you provided to the AI, they didnt ever think to check it out? Similarly to why they all make a line north towards viridian forest (which again, we know to be the correct direction) yet only one AI wandered off to the left towards victory road.<br><br>Any info on these points would be really interesting!"
Cool video idk if you did a video about it but sad that the run isnt finished
"Should‚Äôve added more reward systems , but this is great information"
...so if I eat enough junk food I become Gyarados?
awww the AI was scared of pokemon centre because it got burned there... how cute... poor thing...
What a huge effort put video amazing. This video also clearly shows the most important aspect which is how you define your reward algorithm.
The Youtube Channel ‚ÄûWes Roth‚Äú has used content of your video in a video called ‚ÄûAI plays Pokemon with Reinforcement Learning‚Äú. Doesn‚Äôt seem like he asked you and I feel like you should know.
Code Bullet would be proud.
"So if all of us came to this video with a uniquely played Pokemon Red route and trajectory in the early 90s; and this guy opened a time portal to view those runs all within one AI pattern program:<br><br>Which came first- humans, or AI?"
"Ai are as good as a new impressionable player, it seems"
poorly made video
since when is it ai to spam every possible outcome of something? its more like a brute force attack against the software than software processing intelligence. but whatever dude just keep pretending this is AI since other channels do it.
"Now, make it learn off of how you play"
"No joke, this progression almost mimiced my daughter learning hownto play this from age 4 to 7"
"The AI had a mental breakdown when it put its Pok√©mon away for storage because he has to leave.<br><br>The traumatized AI is so much like us, we developed such a strong bond with our Pok√©mon too"
What happens if you play the other version of Pokemon games with the same agent?
We&#39;re gonna be watching AI lets plays soon.
"PokemonZ ! Ruun, run for your lives....."
"One of the limitations I see with this is that the AI doesn&#39;t learn and remember the layout of an area.<br><br>When a human is playing and learning, we have an inate ability to recognize an area we haven&#39;t explored before. And once we have, the more we play it, the more we remember the area and can efficiently move through it.<br><br>This AI seems to be just winging it, despite having hours and hours spent in the area.<br><br>So IDK if there&#39;s a way to have it remember a map.<br><br>Secondly, idk if this AI can remember Objectives.<br><br>It needs 8 badges but only got one. It got a big point increase for it, but doesn&#39;t know there are more out there. A human would see that they need 8, and to fight the Elite 4, they need all 8 badges, once they found that entrance and learn what they need to do.<br><br>Then there&#39;s type advantage and weakness, move advantage, etc."
This is the best video I have ever watched on YouTube.
"I hope to see this AI eventually beat the elite 4, I also wonder if once this AI does beat the game how well it would work on the other installments like emerald and pearl."
Bro you a fucking genius i need you for my project i got a RPG GAME IN 2D i will love have AI inside of my project with the npcs
Not the video I searched for... but the Video I needed to see!  :D
Great video
"So it learned through punishment, interesting"
He definitely got a  A+
"TL;DR: you&#39;ve earned a tuna melt<br><br>first half of the video made me want to reproduce your work, so big up for sharing resources and giving some DIY guidance at the end.<br>pok√©mon red being played by robots, humans, greyson hopper, etc - it&#39;s been done to death. similarly, there are far more ersatz educational videos on this platform than bona fide scholarly works. <br> you (and your team?) hit the mark here, and I hope this channel continues in earnest."
"More AI simulation videos, bro! Congrats, you made it!!!"
this was crazy well made
This is one of the best youtube vids ive seen in a long long time.<br>Thankyou so much for this.
BRO I want be your friend i got a project what i need help!!!!!!!!
This is amazing and tremendously insightful on how an AI thinks and learn things.
Replace ‚Äúthe Ai‚Äù with ‚Äúmy son‚Äù
"Really impressive! but it shows pretty well why AI, in itself, still has a way&#39;s to go. But that is also what makes AI so interesting :D"
good job on the video‚ù§
"Is it possible to pass the end point, and made AI to the end  of the game in 50% rate or more? What&#39;s a problem?"
"Maan.. you have neurosciencentist mindset. Evolutionary Psychology, programming, phylisophy. Yeah I&#39;m sure. Btw this video smells so much work on it. My bro(also visual AI programmer ..of some sort) and I are watching it right now. We both locked to screen. That&#39;s quality right there. Well made. Thank you."
Paling bercandaan
Watches cool AI learning video on my favorite franchise. Gets absolutely brain blasted by human psychology. üòÖ wonderful work üôèüèª
Still not as efficient as Twitch Plays Pokemon.
"It&#39;s crazy to think humans can do this in real time, and while some quit, others prevail; if each AI run represented every human ever born, then this might represent collective human conscience in real time.<br><br>While some fail immediately, someone will always succeed the first try.<br><br>If that makes sense."
Why does every kid on YouTube have to put some deep and meaningful pop philosophy message in their videos. It&#39;s so cringy. Just show us the tech. Otherwise stomach can&#39;t handle watching it.
It&#39;s like watching ant move threw an ant farm
How long did Twitch Plays Pokemon take to complete?
I&#39;m so proud of all those little AI guys. <br>They grow up so fast.
We are fucked
i love the human segways it reminds me of group projects we used to do
AI getting PTSD from the Pok√©mon centre is both funny and sad üòÇ
These screens also are etched in my memory
"Sigh, it is not actually playing anything, it is running every possible solution and choice and then takes the choices that progress.<br>5yrs to learn pokemon?<br>I would be interested to know if it repeated any tasks even after being sucessful?<br>Did it just pick optimal choices, which is how games work?<br>How do you know it enjoyed any particular task or area, and did it pick optimal pokemons instead of choosing what it liked and make it work?<br>Ie: a full charmander team, or a full party of just one type.<br>What should have been added was multiple choices including bad choices.<br>In this case the program basically brute forced the correct choices.<br>What wilk need to be seen is a choice that is not optimal, but asthetic or just simply pleasing to the eye.<br>Also,the algorithm doesn&#39;t know its just a game as well, I bet if you programmed the rewards to be optional, it might have some issues.<br>I&#39;m just theorizing on here with limited info, but I have been interested in ai and the ALGORITHMIC INTELLIGENCE we call artificial intelligence.<br>Something to note, the human brain does not need to brute force buttons and choices, a small kid learns really fast how to move and where to go, funny because the game tells you where you need to go in the beginning, it seems like the ai is missing information.<br>How do humans know the Pokemon center is for healing, but the algorithm doesn&#39;t?<br>So how can he ai know to use the pokemone center without knowing its functions.<br>So far it seems like the program runs the game, using rewards and punishments to make all its decisions for it.<br>Many humans do thinga even if the reward is taken away, like when you describe the pokemon storage system.<br><br>An edit, forgot to mention how a human fills his roster with pokemons, and the types that were kept, just two?<br>No nidoran,no caterpie,no rattata?<br>Even just messing around, it gives 5 pokeballs and a quest in the beginning to tell you where to get them?<br>Yet it seems like it doesn&#39;t know to fill its roster, and it also does not sit and &quot;farm&quot; exp in the beginning area, I do that all the time leveling my pokemons till they learn a few new moves, like pigey and sand attack and ratattas quick attack?"
"Imagine believing evolution is real after personally coding, fixing and supervising your AI in order for it to perform well."
very good video damn.
Fascinating. I have no intention of running this myself but big respect for showing how to in such a clear way.
Maybe it&#39;s a weird question but when assigning points to the rewards isnt it an option the set a &quot;max obtainable points&quot; like with &quot;Win Gym = 5points x 8 gyms = 40 points&quot; wich might in turn promote exploring?
Too much spit in your mouth when you talk. Gotta clear that up.
IT TOOK 300 DAYS TO BEAT BROCK...and society if worried about dumbass AI.
This is crazy good and a real eye opener. Really well done. Thanks for this dude
That was amazing
you should had if its super effective gain 5 reward point
Amazing edit too. Really well made.
Noice!
You are the fucking man
This is so class
Saving this to watch later
"Just so you know you&#39;re not programming an AI,"
"I had so many things I would&#39;ve like to say like how this must be what god feels like and how when we chock things, he has to change our settings or the fact that I&#39;m glad there are people smarter than me doing these things but ultimately, I landed on this is an awesome video! Thank you for your hard work and you earned a like and subscribe üòÅ"
wont be long till Nintendo sues
how bout we just stop teaching ai how to do shit lmao
&quot;negative association with the Pok√©mon Center&quot; twitch plays Pok√©mon flashbacks incoming üòµ
Oh no. Ai is starting to get feelings
"That was a nice looking grilled cheese in the background at the end... Looks like a saw maybe a bit of pepper jack cheese beside it? Nice choice if so.<br>Oh, also fantastic video, very well made and informing"
Please please please make a full series of AI learning to play and beat all Pokemon games!
Mans makin the worlds greatest &#39;walkthrough&#39; video
at what point in your studies are you to be able to do this? as someone not familiar with the field i wonder what amount of technical knowledge is necessary it still feels like it was simplified a lot so viewers could better understand it
bring it to moistcritical
someone should send this to charlie
"Kind of funny and cute how the AI never wanted to go to the PokeCenter ever again after being punished by depositing the Pidgey  :&#39;(<br><br>P.S. I miss being as dumb as the AI when it started, trying out all kind of things as a kid and learning through trial and error. Nowadays gaming is less fun because after so many games you know how every game works (kinda). All these concepts we already know from other games, make new games easier and predictable."
Incredible video. Bravo to the testers and shout out to the editor(s) x
Let‚Äôs just remember even though the AI was figuring out new things the programmer had to continue to adjust the code to influence its decision making. Life definitely does not happen by osmosis. Something behind the scenes is directing and influencing the decision making
"AI experiments like this one are an invaluable. The behavioral similarities shared between AI and nature are uncanny. When looking at this, all I can see is ants, roots, fungi, slime molds. Zoom out on humans and we look exactly the same.. The simple fact that we exist is so insanely strange, so unbelievable,  we spend our lives trying and dying to find answers, when we don&#39;t definitively know if we are even asking the right questions."
"How is this different than the monkeys on typewriters writing Shakespeare.  It&#39;s just 10&#39;s of millions digital monkeys pressing buttons and you throw it a banana when it does what you want.  It&#39;s like that old concept turned up to 11, we reduce the infinite outcomes by guiding it.  Dubbing this &quot;AI&quot; seems completely preposterous.  It&#39;s just a rote learning algorithm that requires human training wheels to do anything meaningful.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you had fun tho."
Excellent work and excellent video. Huge respect.
Bet most people are here for the nostalgia.
Did the AI ever learn to manipulate RNG to get better Nature and IVs on the starter Pok√©mon? Or were the rewards (having better stats from better Nature and IVs) insufficient to learn this behavior?
this video showed me that i played this game like a ai as kid
Did it chose Squirtle 100% of the time? Was choosing Squirtle just a result of it memorizing and repeating the first few dozen/hundred button presses needed to trigger the RNG to give it a 100% catch rate on the first wild Pok√©mon it encounters?
This is amazing. Great job! I would love to see a stream game of the AI playing this
i cant stop laughing over the AI getting PTSD towards pok√©mon centers from depositing it‚Äôs pidgey
part 2 please
"I would love if Nintendo implement an &quot;adult mode&quot; that auto farm pokemon XP so when I play , don&#39;t have to murder an entire country of ratatas just to be able to win some random guy, and an auto find and catch Pokemon, so I can focus on exploring, solving puzzles etc"
"Wow, this was awesome. Great work"
Praise Helix
Exactly what I&#39;ve been looking for from an AI training video! Thank you!
when you think about the first dozen playthroughs it plays exactly how a 2 year old would if you handed them a gameboy
Holy Shit. This is fucking gold bro.
useless asf tho.. what is the purpose a making an AI that complete a game for you?
How does your AI have access to game&#39;s buttons? Is there an API for AI-game interaction?
What is that page on the right that you are using to type commands into? My Git doesn&#39;t load like that
Life creates machines so that machines can create life. Whom else can survive the torture of time-itself? I feel like I could just be an AI from a higher dimension now. /justthoughts
"This is a perfect example of why a bad AI just made by a rando is a bad idea. At each step of the video I kept saying to myself, &quot;what about X&quot; only for the video to go on another 3 mins and the guy says, &quot;to my surprise I didn&#39;t account for X&quot;...how did I pick up on it I&#39;m 5 seconds but it took you thousands of iterations to figure out? This rule based approach to computational heuristics is extremely limited in approach and it needs to be extremely thoroughly thought out for it to do anything at all. Pok√©mon is far from simple and the rules here are insanely simple and can&#39;t really account for something like &quot;magicarp becomes gyrados at an earlier rate if you buy it at the tunnel rather than waiting for fishing rod&quot; and instead the rule here was just based on local pokemon level which accidentally caused the AI to make the right decision, but for the wrong reasons. This is that correlation does not equal to causality. This is certainly a fun thing to do, im sure, but insanely unrealistic to train an AI to do anything, really"
how did he create all the visualizations of all the AI on one screen? by superimposing each AI recording? How did he color them  differently?
Wow
"This guy waited 10 years to post a video, then drops an absolute unit of a vid"
"When you zoomed out with all the replays in the beginning I was overtaken with awe, not because of some silicone wafer coded to do exactly this, but because as humans, or more simply, as sentient life; we are masters of our environment. We do this on a scale far grander and more sophisticated than any computer than we construct. If scientific rigor hadn&#39;t elucidated the molecular mechanisms that give rise to these states of awareness in the crudest manner possible, as an observer, there&#39;s no other word to describe the incredible things life is capable of other than...magic. it&#39;s really otherworldly. Life is magic, such a gift."
Legendary video. Excited for other stuff you makeüòä
Amazing video! Hope we see some new breakthroughs in RL soon!
This remember me back on the 2007 on AI class they explain how decisions works based on interactions an we programmed a single room with pokemon sprites writing those learning decisions on python.
This is incredibly interesting. To see the human condition through the simple perspective of an AI playing Pok√©mon. Great work!
"It&#39;s crazy how AI repeats human behaviours and learns decisions like we also do. I have one question tho: could you improve the memory of the model by adding a LSTM layer to it? I know it increases the number of parameters of the model, but maybe it could be a way to make it learn faster."
"Thank yo so much for having explain us how you did it with details and, even more, give us the code. Many others youtubers do the way &quot; OMG i&#39;ve trained an IA to play X game!!&quot; with a fake surprised face in the YT miniature but they then teach us. Your video is amazing. New subscriber here"
Well humans never ‚Äúevolved‚Äù there is no evidence for that dead end theory. Dr. Kent hovind seminar 1 age of the earth on youtube should reallign your perception unless one is ‚Äútoo proud‚Äù to look into alternative world point of views.
"I like these little thrown-in tidbits and wisdoms, which basically show that humans also are just AIs after all.."
The traumatic experience lol poor little guy.
"wow. truly, wow."
"Interesting how he chills where the water, flowers and people are. Also I noticed he walkes around and looks in all directions and when he won his first trainor battle he did a little dance of celebration."
"I work as a Deep Learning Scientist and thoroughly enjoyed this video. Amazing project and impeccable presentation. I remember coding something up with a screen-scraper many years ago for this exact purpose, long before PyBoy existed. Of course it was such a gigantic effort that I never got around to implementing any AI for it. I am very glad you find the concept as interesting as I do and have taken it upon yourself not only to invest the huge amounts of time, money and effort required, but also share it with the world for us to enioy. Thank you!<br><br>Now, for some project suggestions that may or may not be interesting to you:<br>There is a paper from 2021 on something called Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM)  by Andrew Lampinen et al. They basically just add a  cyclic memory buffer to a very simple transformer-based agent, and search through the memory with a simple kNN search. IIRC, they obtain improved generalization, sample efficiency and exploration. If it doesn&#39;t completely ruin the computational feasibility of this project, I think that by itself would already be very interesting to experiment with.<br><br>However, what would potentially even more game-changing (no pun intended) would be to combine the above with a small pre-trained language model. If it&#39;s feasible to extract from the emulator memory which text is being displayed on screen and then feed these text vectors to the agent as part of the current state, I think that could make a huge difference in learning efficiency. The Pok√©mon games are FULL of textual guides; simply chatting to random NPCs or even reading signs often provides helpful tips for improving gameplay or advancing progress. Combined with a kNN-searchable memory (if it is large enough), the AI should even be able to figure out how and when to return to pallet town.<br><br><br>Unfortunately I&#39;m sure that the latter suggestion WILL destroy computational efficiency, but it could nonetheless be very interesting to see how large the gains in learning speed are. Overall I suspect adding an LLM will not be worth it because at a certain point the game just requires grinding, and game progress will therefore be slower simply because the throughput will be lower. Still, if that&#39;s the way to successfully complete conceptually difficult parts of the game...<br><br><br>Anyway, just figured I&#39;d mention it. If nothing else, you might just enjoy the HCAM paper. Thanks again!"
gameboy&#39;s sounds are still amazing :)
"I hope this makes sense, i have little idea about AIs.<br><br>To make the model remember things, can you jack some of it&#39;s output nodes to be inputs in the next calculation?<br><br>Other Question, could it make sense to make an AI for the battles and exclude that from the main AI. I assume that allows you to run smaller models and also save money when training?"
could i use a different pokemon game?
Can you pls create and AI model for the Pok√©mon Gold game?
"i wonder if there&#39;s a way to reward the AI for trying new things, not just seeing new things. e.g. pressing the buttons in a different order than it has before during battles. that would help it explore all of the possibilities of move orders and find new strategies a lot faster i think?"
Beautiful! &lt;3
That music is iconic
Can I train AI to work for me from home? Askin for a frind
Love the comparison with human behavior :)
I still dont understand the fascination with this. Why not just program something to play and beat the game?
would the same ai work if you start it on Gen 2?
Mr. Whidden you are an inspiration. Thank you for this.
Love it! I think you should help out FoxMaster with his supposed &quot;self aware&quot; Lara playing Tomb Raider... xD
You&#39;re the kind of quality video creator that polishes something repeatedly and it shows in this video. You&#39;re extremely talented
&quot;When you&#39;re at you&#39;re near lowest point learn to choose bubble&quot;
"a lot of people have trained AIs from scratch to play various games.. but what if you trained an AI on multiple games? how good would it be when you gave it the second new game? what about the third.. or 20th game? there&#39;s a lot of similarities between games, but also a lot of differences. it would be interesting to see it take ideas from pokemon red and apply them to pokemon ruby.. but then also see if it can apply anything to something totally different, like grand theft auto 5, or fall guys, y&#39;know?"
"Great video. Also congratz for having 1 video, and 30k subs! I checked to see if you had any other videos and was floored when it was only 1. Cant wait to see more, keep it up!"
How did you edit this?!?
"Imagine being an NPC in Viridian City and seeing a horde of 20,000 children come your way and just do the randomest s***."
"What a nice idea, concept, and presentation! Very well done! I hope to see many more videos like this from you in the futureüéâ"
"Wow this was nuts, and just noticed its your first video! Hope you do another where it goes all the way through the game just for funsies."
Omg I wish I had this for my Gameboy....this is big brain to the max.
Imagine playing online and coming across the final version of this AI.
"Man....I came here to watch a computer play a game, but now I wanna sit by the starter pond and say hi!!!"
I‚Äôm laughing hysterically cause this is like we are watching the Infection of all of Kanto.
Is there somewhere I can play with machine learning AI to try and do something like this on my own?
Love this and would love to see more from you.  Subscribing so I get a notification when you do
"This is so interesting, you should try to put the AI into difficult situations that ruin the game like those on Pikasprey Yellow videos"
You just watched the multiverse in action
"Loved the video, keep it up Peter!"
"Great job not just in the production of the video, but also in showcasing how AI can evolve and grow."
fight rat
Somebody‚Äôs gonna hire you once they watch this and see ur talent!
I need more of this!
friggin brilliant!
just waiting for a streamer to rip your content to do a reaction video
This is so good!!!
"This is a fantastic video. As an AI engineering manager, I&#39;m very impressed! Great job!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=8m41s"">8:41</a> the ai just rage quits lol"
"really nice, i am no expert and i wanted to do the same for other game. <br>by searching i found out i should create a game environment of the game i wanted to train my model on, which was super difficult to do, so i gave up."
amaz
This HAS to be one of the most well presented and fun to follow explanation and thought processes behind AI and decision making. And the amazing visual format of it all just fits so well. Should be used in college to explain these concepts. Well done!
So God is watching humans like we watch this AI and sits there wondering why we‚Äôre so stupid?
"currently a computer science student here, and I honestly can only understand half of the video. it really goes to show how complex AI can be,. commends to you sir for the effort in making this impossible project"
No PP left for this move
like bro i was just tryna see if the ai could beat the game. it was fun at first and i didnt mind the short explanations here and there but the video switching to a full on educational coding class was boring.
"This is truly inspiring. Loved the fact that you opened up about cloud costs, simulation speed and delved deeper into the technicals."
the content was great until you started to bore me in the technical stuff.
What is the song when entering Mt Moon?
The number of people anthropomorphizing AI in this comment section is terrifying and makes me scared for the future. People are gonna be calling for AI rights üòí üôÑ
How did you make this video...
Finally some good content
poke red is a whole whopping half a MB in data. byte for byte the best game ever made
Good job :D
Starts with making random movements and pressing buttons. I was scared because this was exactly like what I would do when getting into a new game (especially when I was a kid). Nice video beyond a pure technological discussion. Where will technology lead us?
Editting is üíØ
"Amazing work, thank you. I am actually a programmer in my day job but don&#39;t really pride myself in particularly being passionate about it. But this video sparked my curiosity and passion again which I&#39;m grateful for. I have been hearing about AI a lot but I didn&#39;t really have any baseline understanding of what exactly AI means vs just being a fancy algorithm (which I guess isn&#39;t wrong) but this video helped me understand it a lot more. Thank you again!"
"not bad, PWhiddy, not bad."
Amazing. I know you&#39;re going to have millions of subscribers soon.
The question is. How many years it takes for this content? I saw the github commits start at 2019? till now? so i assume its 4yrs?
Did not expect this to be so well written lol.
i hate python syntax
Awesome video! Good job Peter. Hope to see more from you!
Great effort!
"Man this is really well made , like it can used in academics. <br>Legally ROM obtain LMAOoooooooo"
I also buy the Magikarp every time because it&#39;s a free early game Gyarados.
This was amazing
Do you have any idea how much money Nintendo is about to sue you for
This is genius
Cant wait to see more of your AI experimentes üéâ
"This guy makes one video and it&#39;s a banger like most channels couldn&#39;t bump out with years of experience. Great work, excellent content and incredible representation. Looking forward to your next video, even if that will take a year to pull off, like I imagine this must have taken.<br><br>On a side note though, you have a smoothing voice haha"
this is cinema
sheesh 2.1M veiws in 9 days
Well done bro. Thanks alot.
"Pokemon and Ai , convinced me to learn coding and play with these. You have earned a sub and my respect"
&quot;copy your legally obtained Pokemon Rom&quot;<br>&quot;you can do this usig google&quot;
"I think it would be interesting to see how it reacts if you reduce his hapiness every X seconds he doesnt makes a success, it might learn how to speed run."
damn this is cool - ill remember this when ai takes over the world
thank u for the video but plz stop turning up your volume!!!!
"Insane video, congrats"
Good to know the AI had the same experience with Brock as 5 year old me did playing yellow version
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=8m41s"">8:41</a> that‚Äôs hilarious ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt lose if I don‚Äôt press A.‚Äù"
"Great video idea and production. Don‚Äôt be afraid to talk and be yourself as well, must be an interesting person to come up with an interesting idea.üëçüèæ"
I keep thinking that you should have had the reward reduce by a small amount each game tick. Should encourage the ai to be productive instead of stalling indefinitely or getting stuck in areas
The AI just enjoying the scenery is hella cute. Something that some humans should do.  Just stop and take it in. Enjoy the life in all its little things.
"What I love about this video are the parts where the screen shows all the Ash characters at the same time going around. It is such a great visualization of how all these iterations do their thing, but also how much and where the overlaps occur. It looks like an animated heat map. I hope you&#39;ll continue making similar videos."
Virgin
Didn‚Äôt have to go so hard with the soundtrack‚Ä¶ damn.. üî•
Please the same Video but for Smaragd Edition :D
We&#39;ve all seen Terminator &quot;let&#39;s build AI anyway we can control it 100%&quot;  - me ~ Bullshit. Thankfully I&#39;ll be dead (hopefully) before these fucking idiots go too far.
I think ChatGPT 4 can  complete the story in the first run
seeing this is like seeing Naruto trying to learn Rasen Shuriken with a bunch of clones üòÇ
"As I keept watching the video, about mid point I started to sus about the nature of the narrator. <br>So I wondered... Is this video, and it&#39;s narrator, both AI generated? <br>The profile/channel photo even has a hint of random face generation. <br>Nevertheless, great video, great premise, great project, great edit."
"I see a lot of these AI learning videos. I always wonder, how does the AI know what a &quot;reward&quot; is? Why does the AI &quot;care&quot; about this reward and seek more?"
It‚Äôs crazy how this simulated evolution of life on earth and human behavior!
"might be a dumb question, but does the AI know to back track and use the pokemon center when its pokemon are hurt?"
You speak so slowly that I moved speed to X1.5 and it sounded normal lol
"This video is incredible and fascinating I can only imagine how much time went into the polish to make it easy to follow along! It&#39;s interesting to see some parallels between AI RL behavior and our own. You also seem to know a lot about coding, is it from experience or was it a focus of study?"
now i need to see the AI beat the game
i was today years old when i found out you can cancel an evolution
Even if it&#39;s 3 years from now I&#39;d love for you to get the AI to complete the game!!
"There is something so enjoyable about watching all the AI iterations explore the first couple routes to the pokemon theme, very interesting video!"
"Wow, just wow!"
I will keep watching and giving you LIKES! this is something else entirely!
Brilliant!
Great work üëèüèº
Account created in 2013<br>First video posted in 2023<br>Where&#39;s the rest of this quality content?
"This must&#39;ve taken an insane amount of time to not only simulate but also edit, really good video, nice work"
holding an AIs hand
poor ai only wanted to stop and smell the roses. lol
"Fascinating, good job sharing AI training, almost like parenting"
Hot damn that‚Äôs one hell of a first video. And the fact that it‚Äôs at 2M plus views feels very appropriate. I always wondered if it would be possible to train an AI to play more complex games than things like chess. The fact that you managed to do exactly that with what seems to be very minimal resources is genuinely incredible.
"I hate this psyop in the video about the AI being a reflection of a human in any way shape or form. you programmed the AI to have a novelty reward in the first place, so you putting a bug in it is nothing like curiosity or vulnerability. and what you&#39;re saying about motivations, is completely false. this video popping up out of nowhere and getting millions of views while being filled with literal armchair psychology from a programmer who apparently doesn&#39;t understand himself or that actions have consequences is just so odd to me. this video was funded by someone with an agenda, even if thats only your professor. reeks of wokeism"
lol The AI clearly using the right hand rule for mazing solving.  my guess would be it wont go past that part of the game because it cant find a wall that would trigger the up walk? When it walks into the open its &quot;hand&quot; comes off the wall and it doesn&#39;t register that as a path up?
"Thanks for helping my dumb ass how ai learning works, really interesting and well edited documentary‚ù§"
Never watched a YT video twice... but this one. Great Content!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=17m15s"">17:15</a> because the first time it walked there, that was the direction it took and got a dopamine hit from. Can&#39;t get off the drug..."
"Awesome, I shared."
This is amazing and unique. I am learning to work with AI and this video showed me such a fun combination of AI with a game that I played countless times. <br>This kept me engrossed throughout and made me learn something new. I was about to check if there were anymore of this. I was surprised that this was the first video on this channel. <br>I hope you add more of such videos and provide a few tutorials about how this was done. I am sure many pokemon players that are now developers would love them.<br>Best of luck üëçüèª.
"Around the second half you referred to the orange characters as red, was that an editing mistake? If not, you might be partially colorblind"
Watched the entire video and i just want to know if the AI managed to beat the champion or was it not run for that long??
Now this is my kind of content
Awesome content Dude!
What did you do with my boy üò≠
Very interesting
"&quot;Just hit record your first video won&#39;t get any views.&quot;  Meanwhile Peter at 2.1M views. Joking aside, seriously great video!"
Nicee can you do dota 2 AI ??
"Robots are so silly and literal. &quot;Look, if losing gives me -1 reward, then I&#39;m just not gonna press the button&quot;"
"Excellent video!  I will be cloning the repo and playing with that today.  The one question I have though which you didn&#39;t really get into is how the AI retains the information it learned in its previous session.  I know this video was more about broad information, but as a long time programmer but complete AI noob the details around the AI aren&#39;t really included.  <br><br>Great work though!"
Can you Training AI to play Tower of the Sorcerer PLZ
"came for the nostalgia, stayed for the presentation. well done, sir. well done."
Well‚Ä¶ I guess we just find out the best channel of the year.
This is really good a suggestion as far as server costs it may be more cost effective to get an older server off of ebay for a couple hundred dollars. These would could up have up to 48 cores and it would be a one time purchase rather than having to spending a 1000$ every time. It would just depend on what you can find.
can you put in a reward for moves that are super effective? that way the A.i will then start to learn the best moves to use?
Amazing video
"G bro you know what you are doing, congrats single video already a bomb üöÄ"
"This is incredibly well put together. Want to explain a form of AI to someone who doesnt know what it is, this is great example"
But how is the ai going to become the very best like no one ever was‚Ä¶
I could spend far too many hours watching this as a live stream.  <b>thinking</b>
Thats really cool!
madness well done!
For the map visualisation: maybe it taught itself to explore areas in that pattern because that&#39;s the quickest way to navigate viridian forest
"Congrats, this contributed absolutely nothing to society"
Can u make a vid with it finishing the game?
"I&#39;m so fascinated and wanting to see more of that kind of content: AI learning to play games. I wish I could do something to develop that science but I have no talent to programming, sad :/ But, boy, how I love AI &lt;3"
AI: &quot;I love lake&quot;<br>CC: &quot;Are you sure you love lake? Or are you just looking at things on the screen and saying you love lake?&quot;<br>AI: &quot;I LOVE LAKE!&quot;
Incredible work! Thanks for creating this video
Good one. Do another for Runescape or FF Tactics 2.
what a job
Question: what is the ‚Äúreward‚Äù? What do you mean by ‚Äúsatisfaction‚Äù? How do you reward something that has no concept of good or bad?
"What are you, a bot? &quot;A well endowed server&quot; lmfao, there&#39;s a first for everything."
This guy went out and used behavioral therapy on an AI
I keep ants as pets and the seeing blue/red moving on the overworld looks very simil√§r
I subbedd amazing contentt!
"Superb, not much else to say!"
"Only 1/3 of the way through the video now, but is this generalizable? What I mean, is the AI memorizing the game, or is it actually &quot;learning how to play&quot;? If this was trained on Pokemon Blue, would it do well in Red/Yellow (assuming the controls/environment is very similar)?"
Spiral of AInts
Truly impressive
I wonder if it could learn to move through the obstacles like the mt moon tunnels.
"Does The AI run a glitch, like The Mew Glitch?"
Amazing to see RL being used for such long horizon tasks!!!!<br><br>Maybe we can also try a really small negative reward per step taken (or per time step).<br>This along with a very high reward for a boss battle.<br><br>This will make it find the most efficient path to solve the game.
Can it find missingno ?
Is‚Ä¶ is this how parenthood feels like?
Wait this is your first video?!?! Definitely subscribing for more!!!!
"It&#39;s not learning. Its like water. It breaches at the weakest point. It may go and try again, but there will never be a &quot;one fits all&quot; mindset  that works for the AI. It will never know the meaning of elemental types. It will just try something different til it workes."
"I wonder how long the AI takes to find out, that you can through the entire game with only the starting pokemon and that you don&#39;t need to waste time by searching for pokemon. üòÖ"
I&#39;m glad i watched that
This is beautiful. Youre an artist. Please keep this up.
"Perhaps give it one time rewards for every key item it gains, upon gaining the item."
AI when it used bubble against brock: ‚ÄúWRITE THAT DOWN WRITE THAT DOWN!‚Äù
"To much detail, i love it. <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>"
I remember making it all the way to pewter city and not knowing how to catch a pokemon lol
I don&#39;t see the benefit of stacking 3 most recent screens. It just introduces a lot of noise &amp; makes the model take way more inputs. And the benefit is non-existent?
What an absolute nostalgic blast from the past.
"I really like how grounded and transparent your breakdown of the AI capabilities and limitations is, it shows it as a tool and not as a magical solve-all-problems strategy. Also, what a masterful storyteller and explainer you are. This video is very well paced and laid out, congrats!"
"In 2023, video games play themselves!"
Will you consider getting the AI to finish the game? Your editing and story telling are great
Its interesting how the human hive mind struggled similarly with the ledge when Twitch played Pokemon.
dude got traumatized when he lost 10 levels damn
The ai when magicarp: &quot;I&#39;ll take your entire stock&quot;
2 million views? You sir have won the algorithm lottery
I would have been surprised if the ai got past the cave without tweaks :P even I couldn&#39;t get past it as a kid without looking at the manual lol
I did my master&#39;s thesis on Reinforcement learning  and this video is 10/10
Trying to install it as a complete noob in Python but I have no clue how this works and keep getting erros :). Would love a more in depth guide for complete noobs if possible. This looks like a lot of fun and would love to play with different rewards. awesome stuff!
This is how babies are made guys. 20 000 little fellows but only one of them reaches the end üòÇ
does that mean you can hide enough information on a photo to contain a hidden game?
"Hi Peter, are you a developer? This is just amaizing"
Peter Whidden ... I will remember your name Sir because you are genius.
typewriter monkeys
Wow. Really really well made. Subbed üëç
"Man poor pokemon, Ai stomping on those low levels."
10/10
Honestly I remember a time when I would watch these videos and the entire thing would be magic to me now the only thing stopping me is not knowing how to get the inputs put into the game itself lol this feels weird
"Bro, you don‚Äôt need to figure any of that stuff out if you just gave AI the strategy guide!"
drinking my morning coffee programming AI while watching this friggen beautiful masterpiece.
I¬¥d love to see what happens when you keep running this with new generations over and over and over again for like an irl year and see what the heck shenanigans it will come up with
They all look like ants as they try exploring the map!
this is brilliant!
Skynet is here üò≥
I loved this. Random video for me but it was very cool
My goodness the quality of content is surreal
"Maybe a stupid question but one that popped up, during the first gym battle when the AI learned to use bubble, why not give a reward for everytime they hit a super effective? Will that not make the AI always look for the most viable move?"
So cool! Do you think it will ever be able to beat the game?
"The truth about AI is that when it easily discovers what we all are, it&#39;s going to assume that we&#39;re just another AI and in reality, I guess it would make sense since our own eyesight doesn&#39;t proceed what is actually there but, what somebody else wanted us to &quot;see&quot; similar to an actual AI except from more intelligent creatures I were to guess, if I were to make sense of this realm of existence."
Send forth the trainers!
"I wonder how long it would take an AI to be able to compete with game completion with current speed runs of those games!<br>Also, if we could learn speedrunning strats from AIs"
"amazing content, its clear a lot of painstaking effort went into this"
I can&#39;t remember the last time I actually stopped what I was doing to just watch a youtube video. Nice work
"So, Agent 60 is running 40 Games (a 2h) simutaneously and at around min <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=6m40s"">6:40</a> you show ONE of the 40 screens which repressent &quot;Agent 60&quot; with approximately 4800 (60x40x2) learning hours. Did I got that right? Ty for this. Played Pokemon since version Blue and Fire-Red was my last. The Video is amazing!"
i would like to see pokemon gsc version of the ai as its more complex while also has less bug
So many ai running around makes me feel like this would be the first hour of a online pokemon game release would look like üòÇ
you&#39;ve earned a like and sub! well done sir!
"I can already see the hardcore gamers/streamers 5 years from now, protesting that AI&#39;s taking our games away üíÄ"
"If one piece of information gets through to anyone regarding how machine learning works, its that without a good system of &#39;reward&#39;, or without setting up well defined goals, the AI won&#39;t accomplish anything."
"Pretty awesome, now add an LLM to it"
Too much nostalgia all at once. üò≠
Phenomenal video. This helped me learn that training an AI properly is scarily comparable to parenting.
get it to beat the game!  awesome video
"Nostalgic and interesting.  Reminds me of boundary break, but with a different dimension."
I like how it was such a sore loser that it just stopped playing the game when it lost the battles
This is unlike anything I‚Äôve ever imagined being done on a Pok√©mon game. Good job breaking the mould
This may be the best AI video on YouTube. Incredible job.<br>It also has ties to psychology such that the AI clearly did better with positive reinforcement than negative despite what would have seemed to accomplish the same goal.
"There&#39;s a step between viridian City and Forest that i would like insight on, before you get access to the forest,  you have to go to the mart, go back to oak and talk to him to progress. How did the ai figure that out?"
"Funny, when I explore dungeons I move like AI"
Onyx is spelt wrong. Games fake
everyone in 2019 to Nvidia: AI cores on GPU? TENSOR CORE MY ARSE! unecessary! who cares! <br><br>Nvidia today. sells dedicated AI boxes to corpos with at LEAST 1000% mark up. <br><br>AMD = left in the dust.
"It shows perfectly that it is just a matter of time until AI is fully evolved and comes to &quot;life&quot;.<br>If you understand that humans already have run through that learning process until the point that we are able to let AI learn as humans do, you can understand that there is no limit to this.<br>AI will learn from other AI and those AIs will learn from each other again and again.<br><br>Imagine the AI in this video would have the basic knowledge of the world besides the knowdledge of the game itself, e. g. by looking at the screen it would be able to understand that those pixels are a house and you enter a house by using the pixels that look like a door. Or recognizing that other pixels are the entry/exit of an area etc.<br><br>If the &quot;Pokemon&quot;-AI gets connect to the &quot;Buildings&quot;-AI it is not even trying to walk against what looks like a wall anymore but instead has the knowledge that it might be more rewarding heading towards the door/exit/trainer.<br><br>Nothing else happens to humans. <br><br>Look at babys. They see no difference between a toy or a cat at first. They get micro-information. Showing them a toy cat and making sounds lets them not think that this is a real cat because they do not know what a real cat is at this point at all.<br><br><br>Later they have information and can understand that the one is real snd the other thing should look like the real thing.<br><br>AI in a few decades has learned and is learning so much on its own that it may start using Websites and online ressources on its own to learn even more.<br><br>And finally they will be able to get in contact with real life things, when engineers will create &quot;bodies&quot; for AI computers. They will learn to move like us, they will behave like humans. <br>Cheers.<br><br>Written by an human. Mabye."
I don&#39;t have words for how good this video is made! Except: wow!
this is super cool!
"Can&#39;t evolve Blastoise nor Pigeot, though."
"I honestly learned a lot from this, it must have been a long of work and I just want to congratulate you and thank you for working so hard for this."
Loved it
beautiful work! thanks for sharing :))
Still faster than TwitchPlaysPokemon
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=28m29s"">28:29</a> VIRIDIS &lt;3"
Dude the thing about Cheap Junk Pokemon and Cheap Junk Food made me start a diet spot on. Hahhaaa so interesting.
you could make an awesome speedrun out of this.
"Something that wasnt done that i was thinking as a reward, new dialogue text? What effect would that have?"
"Wow nice!<br>Can you please share how you managed to get all the high level map images? <br>How did you manage to setup the AI, did you use Jupyter notebooks to start an emulator?"
i would like to see how an AI will finish the game and what are the most efficient way and most used pokemon and so on... verryyy interesting!
This is amazing
Easy sub. This kind of videos is why youtube is great. If I studied computer science in 2023 I would totally go into AI. It has so much potential to improve our lives.. well and do dumb shit but cool dumb shit
This is just try and error. A real mind would observe and learn. Ai has a long way to go
"And then Skynet happened. Thanks, dude."
"Videos like this one make me more aware of how much we&#39;re learning during childhood. By the time I arrived at Pok√©mon Blue (sorry, Red, but your princess is in another castle), I had already gathered a ton of baseline information, spatial awareness, text recognition patterns, music recognition patterns, so my playthrough looked very different from the AI&#39;s. It&#39;s wild to think that the AI is probably essentially not aware that someone is talking or that they&#39;re in a battle and they don&#39;t interpret any of the information on the screen.<br><br>It baffles me how different we are from AI at this point. We build blocks of understanding and iterate on top of them and if they are wrong, then we&#39;re forever wrong, but we take much less trial and error to get to a point, except that we&#39;re fundamentally limited through our system of assumptions. I would have never been able to reproduce the RNG based instant Pok√©mon catch but I would have been able to find my way to the next location from just looking at the environment clues. In much the same way, if you were to have an NPC repeat the same boring line 10 times in a row and only on the 11th try reveal a secret, that would be a near-impassable gate for humans but a thing of happenstance for an AI."
Too all over the place
You ever wonder if this is like multiverse theory. Just a simulation of trial and error thousands of times over and over again with different but similar results. Fascinating video!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=12m25s"">12:25</a> couldnt you give the AI some basics...for example the water beats fire etc etc... simply if a pokemon is a water type (which can be read in the stats) then we should use that pokemon against a fire pokemon."
"Dude you gotta make a research paper about this<br><br>Unless, you already have one. If so, can I have the link?"
"Is that AI Agent 100 have all simulated memory or few other simulations? I mean are you updated all Agents same time with all simulated memory? Sorry for asking if that sounds weird, im not professional for thisüòÄ"
"Super cool! I have one question: What learning function did you use to update the values given to the various actions? I know there are reinforcement learning functions that allow the agent to update the weights of each choice as a function of a &quot;prediction error,&quot; multiplied by a fixed parameter called &quot;learning rate&quot;. For example, Qt+1 = Qt + a * (r - Qt), where Qt is the the weight at time &quot;t&quot;, &quot;a&quot; is the learning rate and &quot;(r - Qt)&quot; is the prediction error, with the reward being &quot;r&quot;. Did you use a similar function?"
Is this how TAS runs are made for video games? It is making a lot more sense on how those came into fruition..
"After all that effort, AI is still so stupid. AI don&#39;t understand the game at all..."
I loved your comparisons to humans
Wonder how many of the AI had a shiny starter ^-^
So no one has a problem about this ??? This could actually happen if they create robots with AI
This is creepy as if you&#39;ve created life in a old video game
It was also displayed in YouTube&#39;s recommendations in Japan.Exciting things seem to be the same all over the world.
"Wow, thats really cool. I just thinking this AI training last night and now i have this video front my youtube channel, nice work youtube and youüòÖüòé"
"You&#39;ve gained a sub my friend. Do more content like this, and you&#39;ll go big! This was extremely well made!"
"Your storytelling, relating ai behavior to human behavior, is amazing!!!"
Imagine leaving your house to see a literal Sea of Ashes ovverunning your world.
"Wait a second. This is the first and only video on the channel? Wow. It is one thing to set up the AI and train it to play pokemon as good as it did. Another to use all the visualizations and present them in a coherent and understandable way. But to draw those parallels with human behavior and creating those graphics, write a script to tie it all together in a easily comprehensible matter, record the script, edit the video, and upload it, as a first Youtube video ever, on top of that? That requires so many different skills and so much effort, it is genuinely impressive!<br>Are you planning to upload more videos in the future or was this a one time thing?<br>I would love to see the journey of AIRed continue and eventually end in the hall of fame, if possible!"
"holy shit, immediately subbed to your channel, the visuals, the education value for a beginning channel is insane, your up there with the big ones. keep it up!"
"You didn&#39;t mentionit during the video, but to me it seems like the AI never enters the entry of the League or even the place outside the building.<br>Do you have a theory why?"
I wonder what would happen if you uploaded bulbapedia info into the ai
I don&#39;t like lispy narrators.
Try teaching it to use an early version of Photoshop.
"I don&#39;t quite get the Magikarp bit. Does the game tell you Magikarp shouldn&#39;t be bought? <br>I just remember a man selling a MAGIKARP, which all we know about is that it&#39;s a Pok√©mon, in a monster catcher game. <br>You might get rid of it after, but it might turn into another Pok√©mon like the others do, and so you stick with it out of curiosity, which I thought was being encouraged?"
somehow this is more interesting than playing myself xD
not gonna lie this is super satisfying and deeply interesting to watch an kinda makes me wish i knew how to do this
Where is the 2 hour version of this video?
This AI is so cute
"Why not rewarding it for each level gained on pok√©mons with different IDs? This way, if it already posesses a specific pok√©mon, it won&#39;t try to get another until it is lost in some way, like after evolving."
"You should try giving data from a human run to train off. Just like we would watch walkthroughs, it could reference the human run to know what to do when stuck."
"I always like it, when they call it AI. Technically it is machine learning. We are not even close to an AI."
This video just made me love even more my master degree in AI
Impressive.. Imagine getting 1.9 milion views and ~28k subs with 1 video in 9 days. Thats the way you know that you did something right. Congratulations man.üëç
Did anyone run this till beating the champ?
Top Tier Content
Oke this was a bit WAAAY to intresting ‚ù§‚ù§ thnx 4 the amazing vid
"This was extremely well made and impressive! Hats off to you. I could also understand the technical parts, because I study data science. However, this is on another level!"
This is great! It&#39;d love to see this expanded into an AI that can beat the game
Amazing! In a written form this could be a whole bachelor thesis!
"This is so well made. The way you presented all of this so simply, yet coherently, makes it very easy for us laypeople to visualize how this AI is learning. I know a bit about AI learning, but not nearly enough to be able to understand beyond basic levels. I thought this video was super fun! I love watching AIs learn new games. :)<br><br>I hope to see more videos like this from your channel! I&#39;m a new sub, too."
"The AI learning stuff is funny to me, I dont know why"
I completely understand everything I just witnessed.
"I&#39;m a science communicator and scientist, this video is terrific!"
This is how Naruto&#39;s Multi shadowclone jutsu allows him to learn faster.
"you didn&#39;t talked about hyper-optimization, how much time did you tested with an hyperoptimizer ? because rewards are one thing, but the hyper parameters are also key to achieve a correct AI.<br>I would be interested by this :)<br>Great job anyway !"
Elite four: No human were able to beat us!<br>AI: I&#39;m no human
Great job!  I took two days to learn how to leave the house when I was 5 years old playing this game. Thank you for sharing all these well-made explanations with us
"one fast question. Do you know you can disable battle animations and make text apper as FAST, so it can save lots of time? Also I hope you used speedhack and didn&#39;t play it in x1 speed..."
Red turns 10<br>Wakes up<br>Multiplies by 20 000<br>Proceeds to attempt to dominate Kanto Pok√©mon league
"well, wasnt it obvious lol? Of course when he takes a pic of an area with animations it will have Nth variations."
"As impressive as this is, I do wonder how long it takes before AI is going to ruin competitive online games. It&#39;s already happening to online chess and I think RTS games will be next. How long before people find out how to win tournaments with an AI? Once it&#39;s able to learn gameplay patterns that mimick human playstyle it might be all over."
Man you&#39;re video are absolutely incredible
ANTS!!!!!
Think you could get to Misty?
This is amazing. I love you üéâ
So Squirtle really is the best starter huhhüòè
I love your research. Super. Will it be okay with you to say your roadmap to learn how to do enforcement learning with ai?
Love the video
Amazing video! The way the information was presented is simply fantastic! Way to hit the ground running with your very first video!
Just want to say you did an awesome job of showing the process and the thought behind the training. Keep up the great work!
How do you even make the video
Great video. +1 sub
it would be interesting if this was doctor swellman
A really fascinating look at AI and super nostalgic to boot! I&#39;d say be careful when drawing parallels between AI behaviour and human evopsych - it&#39;s very easy to come up with simple explanations for very complex human issues and it&#39;s often used to justify some insane modern philosophies
I feel like these types of AIs are just advanced brute forcing algorithms
This video is the representation of effort. It&#39;s perfect in every sense.
THIS is what i need XD good job bro
"Wouldn&#39;t it be better to reward for every new tile explored, or is it too heavy on memory usage (as it would need to remember every tile previously explored)."
"this was beautifully edited, visually representing everything is huge for a video like this amazing work"
"I can&#39;t imagine how hard it is to do this experiment AND in top of that, edit the video to explain us. Mind blown ü§Ø"
Love how the Squirtle was named AAAAAAAAAAAAA.
"very cool, make more :)"
I like how it&#39;s &quot;clean&quot; and understandably explained. I don&#39;t know anything about AI but this video helped me understand the basics! Thanks!
"This isn&#39;t AI, it is pathfinding machine learning"
Why does it have to start over? Why can&#39;t it just keep learning and do one game?
This is a great presentation for anyone who wants to learn what reinforcement learning works. <br>This is such a great compilation of information and so well presented that I kept wondering about how the videos and clips were made possible. And to see that process as well makes this all the more rewarding.
that one version that deposited it&#39;s pokemon causing every other version to avoid the pokemon center can be compared to how sometimes someone&#39;s rare and horrible experience can ruin the image and reputation of the entire place
This is fascinating. Like an ant farm or something. But Red instead of ants. Red Ants.
Top notch!
"Awesome! This brings back so many memories. I really love your visualization. How did you manage to overlay all the training instances of something that runs on a gameboy? I‚Äôm guessing you used a simulator but still, it looks awesome. I also love the colored arrows showing the ai‚Äôs path. Looks really awesome."
Teach an ai to play ff7. Id watch that all day.
Pokemon Red 99
dam one video 2 mil veiws. The video isnt my style but I have to give you props for delivering this product. I would love to see a legend of zelda 1 ai learns video.
Video deserves an award honestly. Bravo
Do this for every version with the same ai to see its growth in the evolution of pokemon and its gens....that will be amazing to watch
"Honestly this was a super good understandable video, i just sliped out at the last 5 min cause it got too technikal. Frankly since i have 0 experience with the topic GOOD JOB!"
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=14m20s"">14:20</a> lmao.. what a load of BS"
Is it possible to put one Ai in each town and have them all act like Pok√©mon trainer and have them encounter each other and fight?
Basically Naruto shadow clone training.
"Stupid AI, I beat this game when I was in 4th grade"
"Great video, and excellent production values!"
AAAAAAAA
Beautiful work!
"I enjoy this video for a variety of reasons, the storytelling, the portions where the ai stops but then figures things out, honestly the thing that is both amazing (and terrifying) is not what the ai can do, but seeing what it can do to adapt around things it couldn&#39;t normally do. This tells me that eventually way far down the line, the technology will reach points we thought only possible in sci-fi, I can only hope that those changes help the world instead of hindering it. I feel like we&#39;re getting closer and closer to the megaman robots with human like ai timeline and that is insane."
This was a treat to watch my friend! Feeding both my nostalgia and RL neurons &lt;3 Amazing work.
This taught me a LOT about how AI works. While being very interesting and hitting the nostalgia notes. Great video by what seems to be a younger lad. Earned a sub and i hope you blow up and continue to do cool AI content like this.
Great Video this has motivated me to dig out my old computer science textbook and finish learning python.
Such a lucky AI.. Gets to play the original pokemon all the time..
great video. just lessen the lesson on the human experience.
"Why do some just stop and stay in place‚Ä¶‚Ä¶oh nvm, it‚Äôs because they only go for 2 hrs"
It&#39;s like watching every one who ever played Pokemon for the first time at the same time.
Bro you really need a lifeüòÇ
Excellent video! Clear and informative.
"People these days clearly don&#39;t know what &quot;AI&quot; is, this is not it :"
"I like the AI&#39;s victory dance <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=6m53s"">6:53</a>"
Actually so cool
"Valour does not await the passing of years ! Man, just waouw for the work you put into it. And thanks for sharing your code. Cheers from Belgium"
wtf peter how this is your first video?
"Nice, you gave an AI a traumatic experience, and then gave it the space to learn how to heal.<br>Beautiful"
"I would like to know if the AI behave differently with another starter.<br>If it have charmander, it should learn a very different strategy to beat Brock.<br>Suggestion : give the AI a random starter for each run, and see the difference with the &quot;Squirtle only&quot; version."
Mind blowing this is so cool. Was hoping to show my mate a.i decided his pokemon was trash
had to sub for the effort
"HI! i think i found a solution for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=17m14s"">17:14</a>. i dont understand much code but i think the AI walks on edges on purpose so it can fully explore the area fulfilling the exploration reward system not less memory usage."
I just imagine ants and I feel my skin crawl.
Which starting pokemon did the AI decide was the best one?
fun thing is that AI is not actually intelligent
this is fucking awesome what???
Really cool expirement
Can I use my own personal server for running training? Or would a third party probably be more powerful/quicker? I&#39;m totally green to learning algorithms and AI. Also would you possibly have any recommendations on online learning resources?
"&quot;The AI interacts with the game much like a human&quot;<br><br><b>describes a system of &quot;rewards&quot; and comparing screens/close matches</b><br><br>A really well made and interesting video, but can we stop with the anthropomorphizing"
So what saying is that Squirtle is bis right
The ai is playing pokemon red. You playing the ai.
Learning it and this just made me even more exited to know how to do something like this later.
"I appreciate that you draw connections between the AI&#39;s learned behaviors, and psychology. Although I think it can be problematic to anthropomorphize AI too much, you do make some good points. The alignment problem we see all the time in machine learning is very much analogous to Goodhart&#39;s Law that we observe in human behavior. Reinforcement learning is very much built on the principles of behaviorism, and it often fails for the same reasons. AI can learn to optimize for almost anything, but the tricky thing is making sure that it optimizes for the things we actually want it to do."
"Great video, Could you please make a game so I fight AI players please üôè"
"This is amazingly put together, as a comp sci major I&#39;m looking forward to more of your videos! Explained in simple terms and fun! Seriously amazing!!!"
"Rip on pepperoni to the ai for getting poke-center ptsd, and for magicarp being literally so bad that it broke the system lmao ü§£ü§£ü§£<br><br>Great vid dude!"
"Amazing work! I really like the storytelling here. I really appreciate that you included an in depth look at the behind the scenes for how this type of project actually gets done, it&#39;s really interesting to see, and very helpful for those that want to do similar projects going forward!<br><br>Side note, this seems to be the only vid on your channel, and if this is your first video I must say; very well done! Your presentation is excellent!<br><br>If you are open to suggestions, I do have 2 small things that I think may help if you plan on doing more videos like this- the 1st is that instead of just having the agent number, it would also be nice from a viewer perspective to have a version number as well, denoting which ruleset change the AI is on. For example the explore only rules being 1.01-1.xx and the explore w/higher pixel cap rules being v2.01-2.xx etc. I think it would be good for clarity!<br><br>My other suggestion may honestly just be a personal thing, but I find that some of the colors seemed...off? Like the choices were difficult to visually distinguish at times- it was most notable with the pathing diagrams, but there were some other spots too. <br><br>This might just be me being weird about stuff bc I&#39;m an artist, Buuuut looking at your code and some other aspects of the vid do make me suspect that you might be colorblind- which I do NOT mean as an insult- I literally just mean that some of the color choices resemble those made when designing things for/with red/green color blindness. <br><br>Regardless, it&#39;s actually a pretty cool aesthetic the majority of the time! I like the choice of colors, but yeah in a couple places it&#39;s difficult to &quot;read&quot;, and it may be a good idea to have someone proof watch for that.<br><br>Anyway, again I love the vid! and I hope the notes were helpful. I really don&#39;t want to come off as rude or insensitive, I just want to help."
My man out here traumatizing ai
this is such a mind boggling experience that without your well written story i would never believe it. this is immediately going to my saved videos i wanna learn so much more about this !!! thank you so much
I find it fascinating when it gets stuck and doesn‚Äôt try new commands üòÇ
"1.8M views on a first video, amazing work dude! So thorough, high quality and digestable information. 10/10 keep up the great work!"
Stop this
That music is an immediate through back to childhood
"I&#39;m a programmer, but never dabbled with AI, which actually piqued my interest. This video actually made me start an AI course, finally"
"This AI shit is going too far.<br><br>First Pok√©mon, next it‚Äôs global annihilation"
More
"I bet with the correct parameters and reward structure you could get it to collect and grind pokemon. It already has an association with gaining levels, get it to favor depositing and training new ones. Pokemon Master AI."
"god damn it, here&#39;s my like"
Most important part is if the AI could catch Missingno.
"It would be awesome to see this AI being trained with a randomized nuzlocke and a set of rewards using the event flags of the game. Then, let it play the game as normal."
watching an AI learning the game is kinda cute lol
This rules.
having your first video blow up to like 2 million views gotta be terrifying
Outstanding! Great job all around! The amount of work you&#39;ve put into this is amazing.
excellent video my dude
Amazing video! I always find those videos where AI learns to play video games extremely fascinating. It makes me want to learn how to do it myself but I am sadly not so well-versed into the subject for now. Do you plan on making another video where AI would finish the game or on making other similar content on the channel? I personally always wondered how AI would behave when put against a more complex 3D game like Super Mario 64 or Pikmin
I wonder what fastest runs or something like rare pokemon
This was absolutely amazing it would be cool to see more videos like this extremely well done ^-^
this is the craziest video i&#39;ve ever seen. the production quality is so good.
"Nintendo probably would be furious, not because seeing an AI playing the game but playing it in multi emulation xD"
All this just shows me how powerful and unique the human brain is.
This was awesome üî• I‚Äôd love to see the AI beat the elite 4.
"it&#39;s fascinating to see, that the AI is fed with the same stimuli as the Human Brain, that incentivise it / us, to do things"
The AI is insane but the storytelling is üíØ
crazy how the AI played 10s of thousands of hours and still only chose squirtle
i love it
This video explains my life
"This video is so good I&#39;m watching it again, back to back"
"I know the simulation got to Cerulean City and didn&#39;t know how to get past the game without cut. The first gen games not only required you to teach the HM to a pokemon, but you had to use cut from the pokemon menu in front of a tree to cut it down"
"AI likes to stop and smell the roses, too."
Why would you not keep going until the AI beat the game?? What a cliff hanger....
Am I AI? Or am I a I? Are you..
"Dude, excellent job!  More simulations please!"
"So basically if clone myself like over 2000 clones using the Multi Shadow Close Jutsu, i should be able to achieve the same results."
30 minutes just to actually show you what happened
"it&#39;s interesting that we nerer actually teach these AI to percieve the world they&#39;re moving through. In my mind it would be easy to create a list of &quot;floor&quot; textures, a list of &quot;obstacle&quot; textures, and a list of &quot;interact&quot; textures so that they start their journey with a basic understanding of how their world works and don&#39;t waste time trying to walk through walls."
Never subbed so fast
My smoothe monkey brain during this whole video:<br><b>claps</b> robot plays game. Oooh üòÇ
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=31m25s"">31:25</a> what‚Äôs to say we aren‚Äôt just an experiment from ‚Äúgod‚Äù where it can interject when it feels like it, thus effectively making us a subject in its experiments. We‚Äôd be none the wiser."
It&#39;s hilarious that the AI fell into the same &quot;flytrap&quot; that caused a complete systemic breakdown of Twitch Plays Pokemon in 2014.
"Really nice video. <br>If you account for the stats of each pokemon in your party in the reward system, will the AI choose &quot;stronger&quot; pokemon?"
"Don‚Äôt worry, it took me 5 years to learn how to play this game too"
"These kinds of videos are what inspired to me study computer science. After graduating and working in the industry for a bit over a year, I&#39;ve lost that sense of wonder and excitement I had for this kind of stuff. This video and project brings me back to year one of CS where I was excited see all the cool stuff we can do with computers. Grabbed a copy of your code and I&#39;m looking forward to messing around with it!"
This guy now works at Google. Congratulations. üëèüëè
This video deserves comments...lots of them. I&#39;m only 30 seconds in and it&#39;s incredible
thats some delicate work right there takes a lot of touch keep going
thanks god i found this video. thats why internet was made for. amazing.
The answer to all the mysteries of the universe lie with in this video
"&quot;It&#39;s interesting how AI can teach us a lot about ourselves&quot;<br><br>No it isn&#39;t. It was developed by a human brain, after all lol"
Dang AI is just monkeys creating Shakespeare
Moreeeeee
"This is awesome, I wish i had the funds to run something like this or support you more in your work!"
10+ for picking charmander <br>5+ for picking squirtle <br>-5 for picking bulbasaur
This genre of videos is very entertaining and informative!!!
We absolutely must know what happens when it plays with missingno for a long time
Ill be waiting for your next video
"Some of The greatest videos I&#39;ve seen this year... The whole AI training, video recording and editing. Amazing job!!!"
<b>deposits pokemon</b><br>-12 points<br>AI: &quot;OMFG WHAT HAVE I DONE?!&quot;
Hey fun fact controller memories is most definitely not artificial intelligence just a stupid Hustle
Amazing. More please!
"Im surprised the AI didnt throw the game out after fighting 99,999 zubats in that damn cave"
"Almost more impressive than the time and coding that went into this video are the beautiful and succinct analogies you give for human learning and AI. Most descriptions of a learning model like this point out the shortcomings, but it&#39;s fascinating to remember that our human brains <b>also</b> have shortcomings in a lot of the same ways."
The concept of AI trauma is so funny but it makes sense!
"I feel like the way the AI learned was heavily influenced by the chosen &quot;curriculum&quot; (what objectives were chosen as rewards). Like if catching pokemon is a low level reward, it may choose to only do runs where you get many many pokemon vs. playthroughs many people do where you just power up a single or few pokemon"
Job well done. Keep it up. I see a bright future with your channel
"Sometimes, you gotta slow down and enjoy the scenery. <br>Great videoüëçI commend your hard work."
Imagine being the A.I in the scenario where you place a Pok√©mon into the PC. You feel a violent jolt of pain and rush out of the building vowing to never go in there again
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=11m12s"">11:12</a> ‚ÄúOur experience and biases help us make decisions and solve problems more quickly, but they also limit our thinking and hamper our ability to approach a problem from a new angle‚Äù man what a f*cking hard line to drop!"
I can already sense a new wave of youtube pokemon content in the near future: ai learning how to beat the old games. And honestly I‚Äôm all for it
"Very interesting IA investigation. Unfortunately, this demonstrated that the IA still requires work. Reward training would have better results if excluded the scenario? It&#39;s clear the IA was focused on getting exploring rewards rather than beating gymns. This means that IA was focused on scanning the maps than beating the game."
So this is how god looking for humanity
"Found this video because the source code got recommended to me on Github.<br>Main thing that stood out was that it uses 100g of ram by DEFAULT??? WHO HASD THATR KINDA RAM!!?!?<br><br>Also this is incredible and super well made, never thought I&#39;d see Pok√©mon pushing the limits of AI development."
A lot of shadow clones and chakra huh in order to help it learn yeah.
This is amazing to watch.<br><br>Also an easy way to improve battling would be to give reward for supereffective move and deduct a reward for not very effective move.
Unironically one of the best videos I‚Äôve seen on YouTube. Would‚Äôve happily paid for the privilege to watch this.
It might be better to maybe do 2 models rather than entirely random for everything. Like having a battle specific one and then a general one might be easier for progression. And maybe giving a bonus time score for getting to areas faster when exploring.
I wonder if enough time that it would get through mt moon. You could maybe have a regional map of areas that are either further along in the game for example the exit to mt moon as special rewards because it would be cool to see the ai get to the champion and win.
Interesting how AI cannot get past that one section of Mt. Moon. It seems the current versions of AI have a difficult time with so many variables and even monotony in this case
Can&#39;t wait to see AI optimize games in the future! Hopefully that won&#39;t require a quantum computer or something...
did this video or this project take longer to make? this is wild
"Even if we ignore the subject matter. Visually, this is a superb video."
"Great vid!<br>I was wondering, if you experimented with reward/time or reward/input? For efficiency it might be worth a try..."
"I don&#39;t know who you are or what you do, but this is some PhD level experiment! Excelent work and amazing video!"
You probably could have a reward for using a different move/super effective move.
This is awesome. Love it
"Love the video. But I&#39;m not sure about the psychology comparisons. having studied psych I don&#39;t see the reasoning making sense for that fast comparison. Psychological claims should be made more carefully imo. Haven&#39;t checked most of the other psych explanations tho. Aside of that, amazing video"
what if our life is a robot using reinforcement learning in its AI mind
Fantastic to see the transitions and just the scope of the map seeing all the runs.
Bro I loved this. I‚Äôm not sure if you would want to do a part 2 to see it‚Äôs journey to the elite 4 and eventually seeing it speed run.
Wtffffffff üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA is evolving ?
I need a part 2.  My body will collapse if not
"Okay Peter, you pass."
Pfff AI couldn&#39;t learn to beat Pokemon red in under 2 hours? Im not worries about AI anymore.... Excellent video
Just seeing all of red&#39;s doppelgangers walking out of oak&#39;s lab is funny to me and idk why üòÇ
can&#39;t wait to fight the best AI trainer
üòÆ
"This makes me think of human evolution and dna.  <br><br>Edit: Nvm, he mentions it in the video."
I wonder how this ai model would play the other pokemon games
"Came for Pok√©mon, stayed for life lessons."
"I would also say, with regards to the survival example, that junk food is also purchased for convenience as humans have less time and energy for preparing healthier options when working and having families as well."
One of the most amazing YouTube videos I&#39;ve ever watched. How do you not subscribe to this?
Commenting for algorithm. This video is wonderfully edited and compiled!
This is the best video I have seen in a long time!! I cannot explain how much I need a part 2 to this where it finishes the game. I&#39;m also curious if you name the character or it the AI names the character.
Very interesting
fascinating.
"ah, the Ledge(tm). Twitch knows that one"
How do you reward ai? Its not a dog you can give praise or treats to.
Can&#39;t stand when people mispronounce Pokemon like this. Dumb American.
"1.8 million views? Come on, do the boy a solid and just click the button. this was really well made"
i fkn LOVE every part of this video. great work man
sick
This is amazing. Well done. Very well done.
amazing
I like how the ai names everything AAAAAAA üòÇ
I only wish you didnt dive off into psychology quite as often
wow
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m15s"">4:15</a> - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m17s"">4:17</a> - not as good as my Alakazam Sir"
"Did you work on this with anyone? There is another channel @WesRoth that uploaded a video with nearly the entirety of your video in it, without crediting you. FYI."
What a banger for a first video wow...
"The AI naming Squirtle ‚ÄúAAAAAAAAAA‚Äù killed me! üòÇThanks, amazing content."
Given enough experience ai can be really helpful cant wait for that men of iron play pokemon vid xD
This was amazing man! I loved it and Hope your Channel Grows!
"What AI Peter doesn&#39;t want you to know is that a human did not train AI to do anything- from concept, documentation, production and upload, AI wants you to think it let us produce this."
WOW. THIS EDITING IT TOP TIER ALREADY. I&#39;m 45 seconds into this video- the content I can&#39;t even judge but this is soooo high effort. Excellent work.
"A really easy way you could make it progress more efficiently, is by giving it reward each time it finds and/or catches new pokemon. So itll want to progress to find new Pok√©mon."
Really loved the part where he gave his ai ptsd.
Bro giving me nostalgia
"I wonder if the AI would ever learn to level up the magikarp. like clearly the final instance learned to not let magikarp battle, but I wonder if it would be possible to teach it to switch train, or even just figure out a way to struggle and heal over and over."
Nice work.
Amazing~!
"Great video, very insightful. Hope to see more!"
The segment on PC Trauma was incredibly funny to me for some reason. I could not stop laughing at the idea of a PC getting depressed and sad because it thinks its prized Pidgey is gone forever.
Now do it with Elden Ring
"really high quality, thank you for amazing video!"
"You are a genius, wow."
Glad you started making videos.  We need more like you.
"As a fellow Pokemon fanatic that started with Red Version AND a fellow software developer, this is awesome. I have done very little with AI and ML it always seems kind of daunting and not super interesting because of that but this makes it seem VERY interesting lol"
"&quot;I am an AI, I have no fear.<br>But that place (The Pokemon Center), it terrifies me&quot;"
I always knew Magikarp was the reason im fat
As an old-school Pok√©mon player. You could very reasonably create a reward system for every aspect of game play. I suggest doing research on the game mechanics.
How did you composite the gameplay into a seamless map?
What a loser it took it 5 years to beat a gym leader.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=11m48s"">11:48</a> Shouldn&#39;t you have had a reward for using an attack that results in &quot;super effective&quot;? This reward system is like a language you and the AI are developing together, so it can learn more about the game from you. The better you communicate with it, the faster the AI should make progress!!! (I&#39;m making comments as I watch the video.)"
Someone plagerized your video mate. Look up pokemon reinforcement learning. Theyre using clips from your video without crediting you and your hard work.
The millions of Reds.
i wonder if  Pkmn AI felt frustration running into millions of zubats in the cave.
"After 300 days, it finally managed to beat Brock! Just like me!"
Just wondering if you tried brainhawk and if pyboy was your choice for a reason (other than being python)
"amazing, but if you want speed why would you choose Pyboy and other slow python stuff ? C is 10x faster than python, at least"
1 video and he gets over a million views! :o
the ai chilling by the sea at pallet town is a vibe
"Deleting comments, stay classy bro."
"This project and video are amazingly well done. Definitely saving this for if I ever get back into teaching Computer Science.<br><br>Also, the phrase &quot;a reasonably well endowed server&quot; made me laugh entirely too hard ü§£ü§£ü§£"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=3m50s"">3:50</a> It learned how to farm reward points!!! lololololololol"
This is an amazing A.I psychological study worth of a university degree üìú
"<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>"
were doomed lol
"This is the most entertaining thing ever! Please make a series on this! If you could label each experience for it and also make a reward system on the currency of the game as well, then it would play much more like a 5 year old that a parent just explained to about the currency, that is only 1 of 8 gyms and this is a pc where you store unused captured Pokemon and this is where you recharge your used Pokemon using screenshots. Once you have provided it with further insight on its experiences it would be awesome to see how far it could really get, if not beat the game!"
am i colour blind its orange not red
magnifico!
This is amazingly made thank you for this
"So what you are saying is that, if we can traumatize the Ai, it won&#39;t be able to take our jobs!"
Epic üëå
"watching this late, so in depth and I feel stupid 80% of the time, one thing I got out of it is that, I always find Pokemon game style repetitive, but an auto play would be a crazy good feature! (maybe sell it to a mobile gaming company!)"
This video better end with the AI catching mewtwo
What about if we gave the AI a reward for every time it found new dialogue? Might encourage more interaction and solve the starting point problem ?
This is truly amazing
I remember one of my earliest games. I was at the elite four and I decided to start a new game simply just to try out another starter. I play for a little bit and then just out of instinct. I saved the game and lost everything. That was one of the most traumatizing experiences in my life and that&#39;s what I believe that AI went through when they deposited that pok√©mon
I&#39;d honestly happily watch all the attempts of the AI over lapped in a video. I think it would be so interesting to just watch
It could also be rewarded for furthest traveled Coordinate on the map.
Legend.
It‚Äôs scary that this damn thing is thinking.
"So, which is better at Pok√©mon? Twitch or AI?"
"Excelent Video, It answered  several questions I had"
"Great video, but why didnt you rewarded the A.I when it uses super effective moves?"
"What an awesome video! My only suggestion would be to split the technical side and the viewer-friendly side. I don&#39;t know much about YouTube but I think you&#39;d have alot more retention time on your videos if the first half was released as a neat, entertaining video, and the second half was released on a secondary channel to teach how to do this stuff. Great job!"
Wow amazing!!
Really cool concept for a video with great execution! Made my day.
"This was great, thanks"
Imagine accidentally figuring out how to give an AI PTSD.
Nice for a first video!
"I&#39;d love to see a large MMO game give you a server play around with. Runescape, WOW or even Curse of Aros"
Literally me when I played Pok√©mon and didn&#39;t know English.
This was awesome. And also a comforting reminder that AI won&#39;t replace humans quite yet.
Man only 25k subs... I feel like I&#39;m witnessing the start of a new big tech youtuber. Keep up the good work man. Great video!
Wonder how many shiny Pok√©mon you got
Thinking about the editing process for this gives me negative reward points. <br><br>What a fantastic video.
This is crazy good!
why did it change its pokemon name
"Woah! This is incredible, especially for your first video!"
"Wow. I&#39;m speechless, great job on all aspects of it!"
Outstanding.
Was ash Ketchum an AI all along‚Ä¶that got terminated after succeeding one run turning into the champion‚Ä¶
"On iteration 420,00,000,000,000,000,000,069, the AI finds Missingno. üòé"
This is really interesting.
If this content retains this level of professional grade his subscribers will be a million by EOY.
So interesting!
"<a href=""https://youtu.be/DcYLT37ImBY?t=1364"">https://youtu.be/DcYLT37ImBY?t=1364</a> What about adding some module that allows actually reading the text on screen and making based decisions in some particular cases? By maybe adding temporary rewards or so?"
The audio in this video is absolutely incredible. I can&#39;t believe how clean it is!
Never really comment on videos - but you really made a great job on this video.
And to think there&#39;s people that twerk for 10 seconds and make more money than this video.
Holy Shit
I&#39;d recommend a penalty on the emulated clock cycle and weight everything else a bit heavier than you have it.
Legit fascinating how ai and humans interact based off of reward scenarios.
amazing work Great Job
Bros gotta make the ai beat the game I wanna see it
Amazing ü§© is there any better combo than AI and Pok√©mon?
This feels like Shadow Clones learning from each others&#39; experiences.
Part 2!!!!!!
Great example of the alignment problem lol
Amazing video. Subscribed immediately.
now do this with GTA
"I am curious of what starter it got, and you should do a tally"
"Wow, long time not seeing a Diamond in youtube... you deserve good things my man"
"I don&#39;t know why, but this is somewhat adorable."
Funny how the AI was so traumatized of the Pok√©mon center
Good video
I imagine that this is what a gen 1 mmo would look like.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA is a great squirtle name
"Oddly enough, I remember Mtn Moon also being the end point for the younger kids in my neighborhood growing up- lvl 40 Venasaur stuck in the cave haha"
"Fantastic video, very well done man!"
"Although a lot of people already told you, I also have to say it: <br>This video is AMAZING! One of the best I have ever seen regarding those topics! Instant subscribtion! <br>I wish other Youtubers in the coding community would be able to explain everything like you do! <br><br>I see so many comments, telling you exactly how I feel and I hope you understand that a huge amount of people love and appreciate your work. You can be proud of this, I mean it.<br>I sincerely wish you the best and good luck for future projects!"
We need a behind the scenes on how this was made and who you are? I&#39;m assuming AI/CS student?
That fork near a socket looks fun
"I&#39;m trying to build an app right now, saw this trending in github,  clicked on the video and started watching. it really hit home when he said &quot;it turns out when you&#39;re seeking novelty its easy to become distracted&quot;...How ironic. What he was talking about was applicable to me in that very moment."
Amazing video!
I think buying the magicarp is like eating a rare candy yourself instead of giving it to your pokemon.
Wonder why it always picked squirtle
holy shot! That was some well made video.
Thank you for this.
"I want to see you finish training this model to finish Red/Kanto Region, and then move Johto. See if it can take what is has learned and apply it to another game."
The AI has good taste - Gyarados is my favorite Pokemon.
Amazing project!!! Could be really nice that you keep doing videos like this. Congrats.
Very interesting and impressively well explained. Good job!
"As a computer science student (and a long-time Pokemon fan) currently taking a semester off due to mental health stuff, this really helped to get me interested in my career path again. <br><br>When depression and anxiety get in the way of your day-to-day life, your interests can become few and far in-between, and the things you used to find joy in start to feel pointless and mundane. I&#39;ve always loved Pokemon, and just want to thank you for the mindset shift. This video was incredibly well done, and I enjoyed every second of it."
Wow!<br>This video is incredibly well done.<br><br>New sub!
"This is your first video?? Sheesh, nice!"
"As an emerging developer, I want in on these types of projects. I‚Äôd lose sleep waiting for results lol"
Good video. This will tell us the most efficient path to take to beat Pokemon lol
"Amazing to see such high levels of technical and creative abilities combined, kudos! Did you by any chance experiment with different algorithms? Given the nature of the game I feel like some model-based algorithms could be beneficial."
I wish this branch of AI-learning was a thing when I was in school! Great documentary!
very impressive video!
Are you running red &amp; blue? The main reward mechanic is ‚Äúgotta catchem all‚Äù but you can‚Äôt do that with both instances.
"How you managed to edit this video at this calibre for your first video is beyond me. Honestly not too surprised with your ability to learn to do this whole project, but please do spill your secrets on learning!"
"one thing that always seems to be a challenge for these is what kind of information you give the AI and how you do it. it seems like it would be a good idea to give it some objectives that the game itself tells you that you should do. like, completing the pokedex for one. so seeing and then possessing a certain pokemon giving points to the AI seems like a good idea as well, but then you do have the problem of: well, a human being playing pokemon blind for the first time doesnt actually <i>know</i> what all the pokemon are, where they come from, what they evolve into, and so the AI should be the same, but when you make an AI have this limitation you run into problems of the Ai very quickly shutting down potential avenues, and it&#39;s already kind of doing that with that magikarp. the AI would <b>struggle</b> to figure out how to level it and how to evolve it with the behavior it has learned with it. it has no idea how to devise a strategy to level and evolve it and it may not even have any interest in doing so because it doesnt even know if Magikarp can evolve or not."
It was an Informative and enjoyable video
"I would add to the metric something like the damage dealt or making using multiple moves to win a fight worse so it could learn type advantages, stab, physical and special attacks, maybe it could learn to switch pok√©mons to deal better with the situation. And maybe a alternative to the explore reward would be to reward it getting to a new map chunk so it would want to advance"
"hey, just a simple question lol.<br>how <b>exactly</b> did <b>you</b> find a <b>legal</b> copy of the rom on <b>google?</b> <br>I don&#39;t give a shit, I think emulation roms should be shareware since most are literally abandonware anyways, but the way you said <br>&quot;you should get a <b>legal</b> copy of the rom. you can find this on google&quot; just seems really, uhm, disingenuous? <br>just wondering lol"
"Amazing! I had ChatGPT control my Nuzlocke, but this is super awesome!"
Brilliant Video! Well done!
First and only video on the channel and it‚Äôs got 1.6 million views in only a few days. Nice work!
This game background music me me shae tearsüò¢üò¢üò¢
"Did you edit this yourself?  Not only is the content amazing, but I&#39;m blown away by how well this was all put together and demonstrated.  If this is really your first video that&#39;s seriously impressive"
This reminds me of twitch play pokemon
Top tier stuff. Would love to see more from you
I wonder how it would react to catching Missingno?
"[Enters Sabrina&#39;s Gym]<br>AI became self-aware, and all of humanity was lost..."
I wonder how long it would take the AI to get to the end of the Safari Zone
"I would love to teach AI to play jrpgs for me, while I work. Grinding is so tedious"
why do so many of them just stop and...don&#39;t do anything any more? is it a bug or is it gaming the reward system like with the animations? is there an oversight with the simple motivations/rewards?
"Great video. Fun to watch and gives me a lot to imagine. Curious as to why you didn&#39;t add the effectiveness of a move. If you did that, would it learn that healing gives access to moves that no longer were available? Also, If you left out the exploration and added other functions like &#39;leveling Pokemon&#39; would it then associate exploring with leveling Pokemon?"
Much appreciate your work and explanations!
"RL seems anything but efficient or intelligent for open world scenarios. Basically a general solution for the reward function is intractable for such a job. Should we explore a mix of language models with RL, so that the agent develops and updates its reward function by itself by understanding the world around it ingame?"
Phenomenally put together. Me want more
love &quot;run it yourself&quot; section! please we need more run it yourself AI!. thank you
top tier video
this is like when i try to teach my girlfriend to play a new game
This is so intriguing and fascinating.
The safari music at the end gave me ptsd
"Great stuff man, cheers!"
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=17m20s"">17:20</a> Breathe First Search (BFS) being applied by the model"
The editing üòÆ‚Äçüí® how were you able to accomplish such smooth transitions and graphics?
Wow I&#39;m extremely impressed.
"bro, my brain operates in this manner all the time when testing.. so strange to see it fold out before me."
"So, this is how we are enslaved in real life."
Such an awesome video. Keep it going
Hang this video in Louvre
If admiring the water in Pallet Town ain‚Äôt cool I don‚Äôt wanna be cool
I have played countless games like the trained AI is playing this
Would love to see a full play through (that&#39;s what I was kind of hoping this would be)
One of the best Pok√©mon videos I&#39;ve seen.
I feel that it might be beneficial to give the AI some memory of what it‚Äôs been doing the past N minutes of in game time. Otherwise it‚Äôs like a human with short term memory loss and you‚Äôre training it to complete the game using only muscle memory.
Unleash the hoard
"This is pretty damn awesome. The only thing that sticks out are some of the storyline components that were omitted from this test. In the beginning, you have to go into the grassy area before meeting prof. Oak. Then after you get your pokemon, you have the battle with Gary. Then you have the job to do for Oak to visit the mart and bring it back to Oak. There is an old man blocking the road to viridian forest which isn&#39;t open until you finish the task. I understand why they were left out, but i think it would be interesting to have the AI try to solve these &quot;puzzles&quot;. It would also be interesting to give the AI some knowledge of pokemon typing and move sets like physical, special, and status changing."
It would be really interesting to load the model onto a small board like an esp32 or Rpi Zero paired with a small display. <br>Have it constantly running AI adventures as a desk-toy.
"Very interesting video! <br>Would like to share a thought: The score you&#39;ve set for the AI is a driver for its behaviour, just like the drivers that the game&#39;s designers set for the players. I think the score is not aligned with the game&#39;s design that&#39;s why there were weird behaviours, or it&#39;s behaviour is quite different from human. <br>For example, one of the primary goal/ driver was given to the players using dialogues - to become the best trainer by beating all gyms. Beating the gym is a rare moment and it requires player to &quot;work hard&quot; for it. So it is a huge rewarding moment for the players, and it also become a drivers for other player behaviour, for example catching specific type of pokemon or grinding levels. The score you&#39;ve set is only 5, which is even lower than winning 2 battles, and beating a gym can only be achieve once in a long while. <br>It will be interesting to see how the AI behaviour will change if you simply change that score to match that rewarding experience a human will get, say, 1000 points. Or adding more drivers that was given to human players, such as giving a score when taking adventage of elements&#39; effectiveness."
My first pokemon run as a little kid was also stopped by mt moon way back in the day. I feel your pain AI. All my homies hate Zubats
I think the philosophical takeaways are a bit BS
hmm I say let the AI choose between all 3 starters and see what madness unfolds. Not sure how to fix the getting stuck in Mt Moon issue other than pathfinding code though or scanning the area for exits.
"How long would one expect to be able to code models like this, starting pretty much from scratch?"
This is absolutely incredible. I loved watching this. Wow.
&quot;rather well endowed server&quot;
Now AI can waste my childhood&#39;s time for me :?
Really great video! As a data science graduate this would have been a fantastic final year project. Really well explained and presented. If I were to give one bit of feedback it&#39;s to avoid relying solely on colour in your data visualisation. red-green colour blindness is very common and I couldn&#39;t see the difference at all between your red late stage agents and your green mid stage agents. This is less feedback and more of an idea but would it perhaps be beneficial to implement a boredom mechanic into your reward function. Basically set a timer that punishes the model every minute or so (this would have to be tuned) unless it receives a specific type of reward associated with progress eg. new location rewards or winning battles reward. A slight hack might be to reward the AI when it receives money after a battle specifically as that means it defeated a trainer (or used payday but that&#39;s a fringe case). There would probably need to be some additional work so it isn&#39;t terrified of pok√©marts or doesn&#39;t learn to immediately sell all of its items. Also big respect for the dedication to spend $1000 dollars on cloud resources for this haha!
"DUDE! yes! well paced, great outline! Fantastic job! I wonder how would this experiment go for a FPS?"
Give us more!!!!
Did I just accidentally learn something?
Awesome video my man
"Where let&#39;s it, contributed to making all of us obsolete.<br><br>ü§°"
Man it would be so interesting to have it find the most efficient strategy to complete the game fast. And see how it differs from gamer&#39;s experiences
Bro did a whole PhD in one youtube video.
Cool video. Some of the music 12.53 sounds like something I just remembered from one of the old Dragon Ball Budokai games!
Aww I wanted to see it go to the elite 4 üò¢
So what learned is ai is slower than a 10 year old me who played the game lol
AI got stuck in pointless things while it had a whole job to do‚Ä¶who can relate?
Very much enjoyed this thank you
Very impressive and fascinating video that breaks down AI learning models into something anyone can understand.
this video is the reason why I love youtube!
"While this is quite impressive, It just makes me realise how far AI still has to go. It took the AI thousands of hours to beat Brock once, I think most people could beat could beat Brock blindfolded in under 3 hours."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=14m14s"">14:14</a> evolution has selected us‚Ä¶ sounds like a fairytale"
A gloriously well-made video with a great script to boot! Hope to see more from your channel in the future. Enjoy your well-deserved subs!
I find it kind of hilarious that the AI has a traumatic memory of going to the Poke Centre and never goes back because it &quot;lost&quot; a Pokemon there.
Incredible! Great illustration of Reinforcement Learning
This kid&#39;s going places
I‚Äôm amazed.<br><br>1) by the video itself<br>2) by the YT algorithm letting me find this video
I was here for your first video! I know you‚Äôll make it to 1M subs in no time
Fascinating! Not only what you did with the AI and your brilliance but also in how you told the story so clearly and visually
"Is this what kids do with their time nowadays? Get out of the house. Take up a real trade, like electrician or plumbing. I&#39;m sorry to be so blunt, but the world doesn&#39;t need more computer nerds analysing Pokemon games."
Later it will learn to use super effective moves based off a typing chart.<br><br>Only to take another decade to learn Pikachu using Agility is not working on Koffing.
verry cool bro
You thinkt this in less than a meg is amazing? You should see some of the old ZX Spectrum games which run in 40k...
I prefer porkamom blue
"i would have really loved to see, which starter pokemon the AI would have opted for, when starting from the beginning...<br>maybe giving huge award for getting and delivering the package, while removing reward for each step taken while having the package?"
"Awesome video, thanks for going into some technical detail at the end as I personally think thats hard from the outside to understand all the pieces that go into not only creating the trained model but also visualizing it"
I wish they would bring these old Pok√©mon games to IOS I‚Äôd pay big and it‚Äôs not like they earn money on these old games anymore
This is actually a masterpiece. Jealousy overload.
We will watch your career with great interest.
"Your red is my orange, friend"
Can somome explain to be what it means to reward an AI?  Like its programmed to want to be rewarded?
Fascinating stuff!! Thank you!
It would be interesting to see resultingthe neural network with some visualization like nodes lighting up etc rather than the average direction of movement on a particular square.
I find it fascinating that the AI appreciates pallet town more than most humans.
"I truly wish i was capable to understand how to do this, i feel i need like 30 hours to learn how to merely run your code through python, merely downloading everything, noticing my python was in &quot;interpreter mode&quot; rather then &quot;IDE mode&quot;; then to understand that i need something like &quot;pycharm&quot; took me all night, its now 7am and i am now more lost; and i watched this video like 15-16 hours ago, not only does everything i do just say error, but when i open python it says <br><br>&quot;Python 3.10.0 (tags/v3.10.0:b494f59, Oct  4 2021, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=19h00m18s"">19:00:18</a>) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32<br>Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license()&quot; for more information.&quot;<br><br>which i think means psycharm isnt &quot;connected&quot; to python or something, idk, either way i have 48 steps to figure out how to begin<br><br>i just wanna watch the ai like it was my child trying to figure things out, maybe alter some number values just out of curiosity, but i guess thats out of my capabilities, ill keep trying tho, Amazing vid &lt;3"
"Comparing images to check if the AI is exploring the map seems inefficient, I would have used a coordinate system since the full map is known."
AMAZING !
"my dude, that&#39;s orange <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=18m20s"">18:20</a>"
Establishment propoganda dressed up as viral now you understand how you were sold bigbrother with rigged search results. Pedos like ai thats the rule
This video actually hurt my feelings when I realized you weren&#39;t going to come close to completing it.
Bravo. My respect to the author of this piece of art.
Just amazing :)
Amazing! Well visualized progress!
You should try to combine LLM&#39;s with the neural network! So the LLM decides what is going to be done next and the neural network does the moving around and doing the actions
The AI going over the pokemon center trauma is such a cute moment
I loved this and as a 32 year old man who grew up and still plays pokemon...damn I had high hopes to see The A.I. beat the elite four. <br><br>I also thought it was funny that it used bubble as a primary NOT because it&#39;s advantages but I suspect because it was just a stronger move. If it actually learned strategy I feel it wouldn&#39;t try to brute force its fights but hey it IS learning lol
I think for the rewards I would have gone for fainting a pokemon vs winning a battle. and deduct if self pokemon faint but to a small degree. I think for the explore reward I would have gone with finding new long grass and new doors would have been a good way to go
"love it best ai learning video, would love to see you developing the ai for the next video"
Amazing content. Would love to see how long it would take for AI to beat the Elite Four
This is one of the most incredible YouTube videos I have ever seen.
superb video gz !
This is HUGE
Momma popped out many kids lol
"Could you make a video that teaches us / shows us how to do this ourselves? Would love to finish this game (and others) through AI like this. (Sorry, hadn&#39;t finished yet, I&#39;ll try!)"
"Plot twist: &quot;Meat Canyon episode &#39;Gotta Catch Em All&#39; : setting: Johto; As our citizens prepapre for the Ashocpolypse, you hear from the woods a faint mumoring of a phrase &quot;Very Best&quot; and &quot;catch em all&quot; all mixed in. As the sounds get louder, a siren sounds. &quot;Here they come&quot;, someone yells. As the citizens board up their homes, the hoard engulfs the town. Ash ketchums everywhere, in and out of stores, through Pokecenters, out of the local gym. Gnawing their way into npc buildings to mash &#39;a&#39; through random pointless conversations.<br><br>As the sun rises, the town grows still....they have survived another incursion."
It learned to stop and enjoy the scenery üòÆ now if only I could do that üòÇ
"watched 1 min, subbed. this is sick, thank you"
"Today while walking, I saw a blind man walking along the road by touching the walls on the sides of the road instead of walking in the middle. That reminded me of this video.<br><br>And that made me realise why the AI was mostly travelling by walking along the hard walls/obstacles of the map: not because it had limited intelligence, but because it wasn&#39;t actually receiving information like what the game screen looks like (so its blind). The only information it has to make decisions about keypresses, is whether it is gains rewards by doing so or not."
"Very high quality video, thank you! Earned subs!"
"What&#39;s 5.72 years nonstop to finish a game, amirite?"
"Learning from this video, we need to change the incentives in our governments and laws around business and environmental protection to incentivise humans to better aligned goals. Instead of wrong incentives today working against us as a whole."
I remembered this!!!! I remember everything!!!! I want to go back to childhood... Im amazed to see the whole map at once
"&quot;surprisingly, studying human-made algorithms teaches us a lot about, well ... humans! because there&#39;s actually no such thing as true AI&quot; cool video, though"
this is fascinating<br>great work!
This video is super-effective
This video made me feel uncomfortable and somehow reminded me of bacteria
Looking forward to your future videos !
i have 1000 hours of super smash brothers ultimate game play. how can we use the ai to train and learn from them?
Bro talks about humans like he ain‚Äôt one
You managing to visualize the results so well is simply incredible.
What&#39;s the purpose?
I like the deep detail. How can I use ai
"Great job on this, peter. üëè"
"When he said it was a reasonable stopping point after defeating Brock, I couldn&#39;t help but think &quot;What? No, it just started to get good!&quot;"
"J&#39;en ai les larmes, juste merci pour cette magnifique vid√©o üí´"
"I would gladly donate money for the CPU power you need to get the ai to finish the game, for science.. <br>Very well done video."
"I am just wondering if the AI can beat the final boss, why there is no final result of the AI from the video, dos the AI still playing the game without finish it???üíÄ"
Does it work for pokemon blue though?
"10years later‚Ä¶<br>main character: ‚ÄúHey, maybe I‚Äôm in a game? Who are you watching me?‚Äù"
What i would have loved to see is tiny rewards for using very effective moves and tiny punishments for using not effective moves. That would have helped the ai getting through battles quicker and better.
This can be thesis for Comp Sci degree student
What an amazing video!
This is such high tier man! Awesome work @Peter!
"Yes mate this was a bit of class. Really well done, fantastic video."
"this is amazing, thank u mate"
"If I may inquire, how did you do the opening shot of the video? How was the game seamlessly recorded through all of the areas? How was each ai recorded? How big was the files size for that part alone"
Just amazing. Subscribed
"When the AI Made such a strong negative opinion with something (the poke center) it avoids it entirely, <br>I felt that. <br>Literally so cute to &quot;teach it&quot; depositing Pokemon won&#39;t harm it &lt;3"
I never thought I would want to watch something like this. Thank you. I really enjoyed it!
"Bro you gotta let it fully beat the game, set it, so it has to catch 151 diffrent pokemon, give bonus rewards for legendaries, get all badges, do the elite 4. This is a cool project"
"Is this seriously your only video? You joined in sept 2013 so i feel you&#39;ve had some activity before this and you gained 23k subs from just this?<br><br>I call sus.<br><br>That said, this video was very informative!"
"How dare you show the world my  1996 Pokemon Red gameplay footage! lol<br><br>Great video, btw."
"This is like something out of multi-dimensional theory, but visualized through Pokemon.  I think I&#39;m in love..."
Was this done on Apple Mac or Linux? Thanks
The fact AI is just Dopamining is great.
"If it evolves Magikarp into a Gyarados, that&#39;ll be something very special. Awesome video mate"
Wow!!! Good Job
This is sick. Thanks for putting this video together. Awesome project.
"This might be sacrilege to suggest, but you could have two AIs, one for overworld movemement and one for fighting, since they are so vastly different paradigms. Cool project, and awesome video editing!"
"I imagine the sperm race to the egg to be similar to this, whoever beats the elite four first will be born."
So basically you teach the AI to use naruto&#39;s shadow clone jutsu to learn new things at an accelerated speed
one of my favourite videos. great and well structured content presented in a way anyone could understand. please keep it up
"Dude, what an amazing video! Thanks for sharing!<br><br>Super excited to try make a AI project rn!"
Reminds me of that scene from the movie Next.
"As a lifelong Pok√©mon fan, this video was incredibly nostalgic to me in such a strange way. I found myself looking at this AI like I was a proud father or a proud older brother. This AI was reminiscent of me as a child too young to understand how to effectively play Pok√©mon. How to get out of the starting room, admiring the scenery, and having a feeling of dread the first time I put a Pok√©mon into a PC box not knowing that I can easily get it back, etc. - all things we experienced as children. Needless to say, I was beaming ear to ear while rooting for the AI to discover by trial and error like we all did has kids. Hats off to you sir, what an amazing video, and thanks for making us look at AI as the ‚Äúnew generation‚Äù for us to teach, root for, and be proud of!"
Excellent work. I&#39;m wondering if you could overcome the Brock boss battle using reward engineering somehow. Thoughts?
It¬¥s kinda scary that I am only one of these Bots in terms of evolution.
Aawesome stuff
how can you apply this to different video games ? also what if  it was an rpg where there is  milions of items ncps places and equipment options ?
This is what it would look like if Pokemon Red was an MMORPG
"In the 90s, Pokemon was created. In the 2000s, I started playing Pokemon. In the 2010s, Twitch started playing Pokemon. In 2020s, AI started playing Pokemon."
Which Mac version are you using? Any M1 or M2 versions?
"I thought this vid was good but not generally my cup of tea.<br><br>Then i realised this was your only vid. Well done bro, have a like and a sub"
Awesome video! Can&#39;t wait to see more from you Peter!
"Great video. As a personal opinion on how I would tackle the problem (I&#39;m no AI expert at all, but still), I think the best approach in terms of rewards would be:<br>1- Exploration: visit new areas of the map (the game tracks in which area you have been, rating new routes/cities as big rewards, tiles as small) instead of screens<br>2- Team development: not only levels but also stats of the pokemon team, might lead into not cancelling evolutions or training pokemon that have better stat gains<br>3- Overall progress: I think that submissions such as delivering the oak&#39;s parcel or completing rocket dungeons need to be input (on top of medals and pokemon league). After all, these are the &quot;inputs&quot; that we as humans get while playing the game."
"youre 6 years old. you love insect pokemon. its saturday morning and you have run down to the local forest to hunt for metapods. as you enjoy the cool crisp air filling your young lungs you hear a slight rumble in the distance. you look up, confused, your young mind struggling to comprehend the lovecraftian vista unfolding beyond your ken; a wave of men barrels down on you. or is it a wave of man? since all of them appear to be the same. fear overwhelms you. you shake uncontrollably. but you have the heart of a warrior and your hands instinctively go to your belt. you feel ratatas pokeball expand in your hand, but its too late. you are engulfed"
&quot;It&#39;s incredible that relatable experiences can emerge from an algorithm playing a video game.&quot;<br><br>My fella in christ. You implemented the objectives.
This video is pure gold
&quot;Deposits pokemon in poke centre&quot; Has a midlife crises.
It¬¥s really funny to see the AI. It¬¥s like watching an idiot play. The PC Trauma cracked me up.
The Ai is going to be the very best
Can the ai understand text and instruction? It will help ir to decide which town to progress
"<b>facepalm</b> can we stop calling it an AI though? It&#39;s not that, it&#39;s a very small self-editing algorithm going through steps to &quot;learn&quot; and change."
This is fascinating.
Pokemon center ptsd im fucking dead
amazing kid.
Imma need you to beat the whole game with this please this is so interesting to see
"This is an interesting concept and well-made video. I‚Äôd like to see some follow-up if there is anything on the AI getting closer to finishing the game. <br>I was wondering how you were handling the back tracking required in the game, and thought it would be interesting to see if you rewarded total stats rather than total levels in the party. Likewise, seeing how the AI picks different moves would be interesting too, which you covered here in detail, but at this point the AI hadn‚Äôt learned anything about move power or effectiveness."
"What a truly inspiring video, nostalgia, education, entertainment, curiosity all in one. Thank you for the incredible work Peter! You‚Äôve got me wanting to play Pokemon again!"
This is a masterpiece
"Why not feed a main AI all of the information about this game, then allocate the capabilities to move and play this game and see how would it behave"
"Seems that the IA dont like to go down cause Pallet to Mt Moon is a up and right way. Good project, i liked it! Hope to see next episodes when IA can exit Mt Moon and do complicated things like cut and surf."
The ai acting like a little kid cracks me up
This is the way I played games as a kid. They were all in English and I didn&#39;t know the language at the time so it was by trial and error.
"I love how at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=8m44s"">8:44</a> it just went gfy and refused to allow its negative reinforcement to happen, isnt modern ai so interesting"
"this is incredible, thank you!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=9m39s"">9:39</a>  made me tear up"
This was incredible. Well done mate
"Amazing video, does the AI take any information from the screen or does it perform well purely on the sucessfulness of the button pressing order?"
imagine AI doing Gotta Catch &#39;Em All reward
What would be interesting is for you to have a go at the old game NetHack.
"Your effort in making this video did not go unnoticed, well done"
nice!
Reminds me of twitch playing pokemon
Bro you&#39;re a genius. I am looking forward to seeing more videos on your channel. Subscribed!
I have a Nvidia Tesla k20 just for this purpose :)
this man gona sell this shit for testing games and be rich ass hell
"This is an amazing video! I love videos of AI, especially AI playing video games and this video might be my favorite so far, great job! Hope to see more in the future."
"More videos like this please! (Subscribed). Find this really interesting, the way the AI has to learn itself is so intriguing."
Absolutely great work!
"I can&#39;t say that drawing tenuous parallels between the behavior of an algorithm and human behavior benefits the video. Maybe save it for the end, let folks watch the work done without the pseudo-scientific philosophizing?"
Incredible first video &lt;3
"After seeing a youtuber pretending to make an IA playing Lara Croft, without showing a single line of code. This is a masterpiece and it feels great to have almost all the answer we wants."
üòç
1 video 1 idea 1.5m views.Congrats my dude!!!
My mind is blown. This video is so freaking well made. You are the ultimate pokemon trainer trainer.
really well made video
Amazing work!
Awesome video! Thanks for putting the time and effort into editing this well too!
"Does anybody know if there is an AI, that can play TCG?"
"Repent to Jesus Christ ‚ÄúAnd God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.‚Äù<br>‚Ä≠‚Ä≠2 Corinthians‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠9‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠8‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NIV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨<br>h"
You&#39;re awesome. That&#39;s all
"This video is phenomenal, I don&#39;t know much about AI but you explained it so consisely that it made sense to me. The visuals also helped a lot!<br><br>Hope we get to see some more of your future projects!"
I plan to use this method to train the first terminators to slaughter humans.<br>Thank you for the explanation.
"Thanks for the video, I learned a lot how AI works."
Me over here hoping the A.I figured out some new glitches like the missingno glitch üòÖüòÇ
Omg this is the only Pokemon game I ever played. I finished it and enjoyed it but I never thought it was amazing and never got the Pokemon hype.
Great presentation of your project
I put on this video just to have something on my 2nd monitor while coding.. My eyes were GLUED to the screen for the entire video
"Great job on your research. I applaud you for the editing as well. I know this takes time, but we look forward to your next video. ü§ôüèæ"
"This was a really great video. I‚Äôm glad you took some time to go into the technical details, that was really interesting for me!"
Make AI plays old school RuneScape
Seeing so many player characters on the map reminded me of that one online Pokemon game where everyone&#39;s character is rendered on the map. Absolutely loved this.
who are you? This is one of the best videos i&#39;ve seen on A.I and just enjoyable overall. 100x better than A.I courses
"i don&#39;t think you should reward based on image difference, you could for example create a 1000x1000 matrix  and populate it with 0s, assign a 1 when a new square block (starting from 500,500) is found, if it&#39;s north it goes to 500,501, if south 500,499 and so on, so you can give exploration rewards only if he does find an actual new block of map, it is much lighter in terms of code and iterations needed to get to the next area, and fixes the &quot;cave it&#39;s all the same&quot; problem. Maybe you could take note of coordinates the player is in and everytime it moves just update those by 1, when a certain multiple of coordinates is reached, then also the new block is reached."
Awsome video!
I actually feel bad for the AI that deposited a Pokemon into the computer and thought it ruined its game.
"amazing content, very interesting as learning materials"
This video is incredibly well made!
Please do this also with Pokemon Yellow and Gold/Silver/Cristal ‚ù§
"NOW CHANGE THE REWARD TABLE, TRAIN A LOT OF AIs WITH DIFFERENT REWARD TABLES. THEN MAKE THEM FIGHT EACH OTHER. REPEAT FOR BETTER REWARD TABLES."
More more more! Keep it going! Loved watching this.
"This is an amazing video and an excellent experiment, I enjoyed every minute. Thank you!"
Mindblowing
On of the best videos on the subject! Very well done in so many ways. 10/10. The only thing I wish for is the extended version =D
Noice
"This is a really well made and insightful video, you have a talent for this structure"
"&quot;Curiosity leads us to our most important discoveries but at the same time, it makes us vulnerable to distraction and gets us into trouble&quot;. I am watching this video while at work xD"
Now when he figures out how to get a level 100 metapod thats a wrap
"This is a very well done video. Excellent, Peter! Such an interesting analysis of the evolved behaviour too, and the visualisations were easy to comprehend!"
Amazing. Please continue this series. Part 2
"Funny, through the process it&#39;s actually you&#39;re the one who is learning to write better rewards not the AI.<br><br>Amazing video, haven&#39;t seen this high level of quality in a while."
Can we consider this experiment the start of the ai vs human downfall? üëÄ
"I&#39;m a 37 year old man who poured over the very first Nintendo magazine before it&#39;s release here in the UK many many years ago, I found this video to be a mixture of heart-warming, eye opening and hilarious. Great job, thank you for doing this it&#39;s so well put together."
would it be possible to have another ai give the reward for the first?
"This is creepily enlightening, Just like how studying an algorithm is teaching us a lot about ourselves, what if we are the Algorithm or AI equivalent for some being who has perhaps just simulated us to study us and learn more about their own selves?"
Yo nerds are the future. ü´°
"I‚Äôd say, stop extracting AI, it‚Äôs just a probability density adjustment. Nothing too fancy."
Amazing Video. Thank you for this project
This was amazing and I can&#39;t wait to see more of it
This alone is a quality lecture video...
"i did the same ahaha xD in my first playthrough<br>instead of limiting the ai to the novelty factor, make it search for something that challanges it&#39;s current state and make it search for ways to make oneself stronger - and fule it with the desire to outgrow itself .<br><br>depositing a pokemon made me traumatised too haha xD"
"Superb, it should be said"
@peterwhidden uh are we related lol? This isn&#39;t a common last name...
Love this! Please make another where the AI is optimised to complete the game. I for one am subscribed and waiting for that day!
"existential split mind*20k:<br>ai: AAAAAAAAAA <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=0m40s"">0:40</a>"
"thats so cool! I know it sees the screen, but does it read the words? Would it be possible to reward super effective moves and punish not very effective to teach it type match ups? ex: it sees that its against a geodude and chooses to use a water move as opposed to thinking pidgey is a god because of all the super effective attacks it got in the forest."
Pok√©mon Red 99
"I am a current data analytics student, and I was starting to get uninterested in my major.<br><br>This video has motivated me to keep learning because this is cool AF!"
the lavender town music in the pc segment took me OUTTTTT
going back with a over 20yrs old Game mixed with a tech that came to hype in 2023 (just some made up year) is so cool to watch
How does it decide evolving is beneficial? Does it somehow notice that the pokemon is stronger after battling something after? Does it have to go through  generations  and generations and somehow notice that evolved pokemon are better? There are some very vague aspects of this video where it seems like the ai just magically evolves.
"Great video, however it‚Äôs dangerous to over personify AI behaviour as relatable human equivalents"
holy shit that counterclockwise perimeter behavior is kinda similar to how ants map out and explore spaces
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=15m54s"">15:54</a>, it looks like when you get a migraine."
Maybe you should reward it for finding items?
"This was brilliant. So good in fact, that this guy stole your video - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4g_UT1HbpE"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4g_UT1HbpE</a>"
Ate you able to add restraints that force it to push a button?
Tried to fall asleep to this but watched the whole thing üò™
Any chance of uploading a video of the AIs best run from beginning to end?
üò≠i felt so bad for the AI when it got traumatized.....too relatable
That is great but it would been cool to see how it over comes having to go back to places with fly and cut.
This was like watching TwitchPlayPokemon
amazing video
Superb. For the algo.
great quality content ! good job
"Fantastic well-edited and greatly explained video. Youtube has hidden gems every once in a while!<br>I think the parallelism with Junk food/Leveling up is a bit of a long shot, but I see the point you want to make. There is quite an interesting relationship between AI and human thinking.<br>Thank you!"
I always bought the magicarb and made it evolve
‚ÄúJust hanging out and admiring the scenery is more rewarding than exploring the world‚Äù<br><br>Amazing work Peter! I look forward to see how this will progress
No lie i accidentally clicked this video and heard this fuckin pokemon music and went back in time wtf üíØü§£üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Please do a part 2 or the most optimal run of Pokemon Red!!
"This was brilliant, earned a new sub"
What the name of the game and where to download? Sorry for my ignorance.
"Grear video, please let there be a part 2"
I almost think visiting a pokemon center and talking to the lady should reward a point each visit and +1 in each area as a one time &#39;visit&#39;
AI plays minecraft to find the most efficient strip mining method
"Wooowwww and woowwww, this is amazing."
"It&#39;s oddly comforting to me to realise that this AI would most likely tackle Rock Tunnel exactly the same way 8-year-old me originally did: just stumbling around in the dark, entirely unaware of the existence of the Flash HM and how/where to find it."
The fact the AI also has ADHD is hilarious
"The AI isn&#39;t &quot;curious&quot;, it is merely following the set of flawed instructions it&#39;s been given. This is not comparable to human curiosity at all."
It&#39;s interesting but this is not how humans play. Humans don&#39;t try every single possible permutation of a game. Imagine having to play Pokemons billions of times to progress in it.<br><br>This stuff will lead to better ai that doesn&#39;t need to do this in order to be successful.
I&#39;m so excited to see where this goes!
"I love AI, I loved Pokemon. Thank you very much :)"
This video Your Voice is Perfect Thank You!!!
This could‚Äôve been like a thesis for a bachelor‚Äôs degree or something
Your voice is so calming i was to stressed and then i played your video now i am to relaxed and pokemon red theme music was also helped. Thank you ‚ù§
This is incredible
I&#39;ts impressive that you need an AI for that. I thought you could defeat the game just by pressing A multiple times.
"I wonder how it would work if you only hooked it to the in game rewards. Money, badges, pokedex, and Xp. Further applying this if successful could prove a way to evaluate how effectively the game teaches the player how to play without words. Allowing developers to play test quickly and without human input early in the development process."
"A few suggestions:<br><br>1) start with bulbasaur. He is good against all the gyms up until Koga and Blane. Also he is arguably the best starter. Lapras &gt; blastoice. Arcanine/montres&gt; charizaed<br><br>2) give a point for entering new rooms. One new point pr room<br><br>3) subtract a point for standing around too long. <br><br>4) make every party Pok√©mon worth 3 points. Subtract one point when health is halved. Subtract a second when in the red, and a third when it faints. Have all the points restored when Pok√©mon are healed. This could encourage using potions in battle and healing moves.<br><br>5) find all the story beats, and have them give points. <br><br>6) give points for finding items<br><br>Try this!"
"Dude this was mind-blowing, the explanation and the editing were crazy good, best AI learning video I&#39;ve ever seen"
Worth it!
Gathering data is one thing but analyzing it and interpreting it is kinda nuts.
Will this AI become the best Pokemon Trainer of all the time ?
This was amazing and quite detailed!
I hope this video takes you places you deserve to go in this field of technology! How Badass!! <br><br>I also got stuck in pallet town next to the water and the NPC‚Äôs!! I knew there was something more and wanted it before I could have it üòÜü§£üòÇ
Would be cool to see an improved version of this as a twitch stream.
This getting out of hand!!
Imagine 3d version video games with ai...
That one ai: YOU DONT KNOW WHAT IVE SEEN INSIDE THAT CENTER!
Haven&#39;t even finished the video yet and this is already one of the coolest videos i&#39;ve ever seen. Amazing work man!
Not gonna lie this is suprising cool i was not expecting to watch this 5 time in a row
Time for RuneScape bots to
"is this a doctoral thesis? and if so, why not have your a.i. write it for you?"
"I want to learn how to do this, nice work! üôåüèª"
I love the fact that the AI named his first Pok√©mon &quot;AAAAAAAAAA&quot;. It makes sense why it did that but it gives emotional vibes how the AI is feeling during the play through. It is still completely traumatized from its first visit of the Pok√©mon center.
üòÇ this is next level entertainment
100%
i miss twitch plays pokemon
"This video is amazing, I didn&#39;t expect to learn as much as I did. Thank you! üéâ"
‚ÄúWould you like to name your Pokemon?‚Äù<br><br>AI: ‚Äú_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ‚Äú
Wait... <br>This channel has been around since 2013???<br>Did you delete your previous videos or something??
Wait.... It legit stopped to smell the roses. Thats beautifully terrifying..
"Alright 2 hours later I got it working on Windows. Like 7 environment issues. Maybe this will help someone.<br>Basically I downgraded Python from 3.12 to 3.11.4, then had to upgrade some of the dependencies in requirements.txt - contourpy to 1.1.1, jaxlib to 0.4.17, numpy to 1.26.0. I started from scratch too so I had to download python, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Build Tools, and specifically &quot;MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (latest)&quot; and &quot;Windows 11 SDK (10.0.22621.0)&quot; from the Build Tools. I also had to manually download and install FFmpeg and manually add it to the PATH. I also had to manually add Python to the path. Oh and I had to manually download conda. I&#39;m probably forgetting a few things. Anyway good luck trying."
After watching this video for a bit i realized that we as humans probably are a biological AI but with a mental cap due to biology/evolution
"I was playing video games before I could read, pokemon red being one of them and I feel it took me just as long as the ai üòÇüòÇ"
Reaaally interesting!
"the amount of effort it took to integrate this together.. the multiple playthroughs, maps, reading the variables from the game, iterating the rewards!"
That was cool.<br><br>Would be dope to see it with Diablo 2.
This video as absolutely fantastic. Looking forward to your next one
Why are you trying to relate ai to humans? I just want to watch ai play Pok√©mon
its like watching ants
"Not bad, first video is 1.4M views - thoroughly enjoyed the video"
"Absolutely stellar video! I was seriously blown away by the visualizations, not to mention the scope of the project overall. I wonder if encoding some notion of Pok√©mon type diversity would be useful if you take this even further down the line. Seems like giving it a nudge in the direction of being prepared for different battles they may encounter in the future would be cool to seeüòä"
"The amount of work you&#39;ve put into this is so incredible. All of the self recording of <i>all</i> of the AI iterations meant time spent (never wasted) for the sake of a single video. From the editing you&#39;ve shown down to the research of how the human psyche works, this is beyond something I would even think to produce. You will go far in your endeavors."
I never comment bro but this video is a masterpiece and it&#39;s the first I&#39;m learning of you. Keep it up
"bro this video is unreal.. Hella bias cuz gen 1 games were the childhood, but seeing it broke down by the A.I learning process was amazing. 10/10 video man, very imformative and well worded for those of us not so versed in the digital worlds vocabulary lmao"
so how far in the game did the best model reach?
Did you catch them all? No? Ohh.. you Need a better KI !!
"I remember watching Twitch play Pokemon, which felt like an amazing achievement. This compared to that feels like a similar achievement! Good job, great video!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=17m14s"">17:14</a> Maybe it‚Äôs feeling around to get a sense of the area?"
it only took it 5 years...
"Great to see code, did a quick skim and did not think the Baselines PPO could handle a task like this! The project and this video must&#39;ve been a tour de force to produce, but the result is great."

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=25m30s"">25:30</a> I love this"
I‚Äôd be curious to see what behavior the AI would learn in order to get to the point of beating the Elite Four and Champion
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=8m40s"">8:40</a> The only winning move is not to play"
It‚Äôs almost like at first watching babies play then when they get smarter they‚Äôve evolved into a kid with somewhat understanding then it becomes more mature becoming a teen knowing more knowledge making it proficient then it may become really good at it when it turns into an adult know the objective and know completely right from wrong it‚Äôs like I watched a human conscious grow and evolve which ngl makes me feel weird what if we are AI too? And we‚Äôre truly in a simulation. We grow from trial and error growing our consciousness
The visuals and graphics you were able to build from the raw data output of your algorithm is very impressive. Amazing video and easy to digest as a relative novice to RL. Awesome work!
Great!!!  „ÇÅ„Å£„Å°„ÇÉÂáÑ„ÅÑÔºÅüéâ
But can it catch legendary birds
you gotta be kidding xD &lt;3
For some reason I‚Äôm thinking about Tesla‚Äôs Full Self Driving while watching this video.
Thank you for all of this. You just made my life better.
... are you tired of this topic? Becwyse i would love to see more experiments with this
This was a very fascinating video. It is interesting and nostalgic to see how an AI does something I‚Äôve done dozens of times (played through Pok√©mon red) and how it learns. You also presented this very well in the way you demonstrated progress visually on screen while explaining what the rewards were. Saving the details and technical set up for the end allowed me to have some idea how they‚Äôd work.
"It&#39;s one thing to set all this up, and it&#39;s another to visualize and present it in such a coherent and digestible way. You did both so well! Hope to see more content from you in the future"
"Damn guy massive respect and love the content, but, wow was the preaching unnecessarily annoying.<br>Live and let live anyone?<br>You might think it comes from a good place but, you‚Äôre treating people like they‚Äôre the a.I. in your videos and I don‚Äôt even know if your capable to conceive such an idea."
"Would it be worthwhile to put in a negative point counter that grows incrimentally to the time between new areas found or to time spent not moving, and would reset once it moves? <br><br>This would be a passive way to implement &quot;impatience&quot;; if a character is stuck in an area that looks the same and doesn&#39;t trigger the &quot;new area&quot; (in both Viridian to Pallet or in Mt. Moon) then it would find standing still and not continuing to move would impact it negatively, I would think? It&#39;d teach the AI that moving, even if there are no &quot;new&quot; areas, is more beneficial than standing still."
"Very informative. I notice  you may also be colorblind. Fantastic job on the video. YT algorithm made this viral for you.  Much of this information is out of my realm of understanding, but you dumbed it down for us early learners very well!"
"This is insanely well done! Out of curiosity, how long did this take you from idea inception to final video product?"
"Aight so, twitch beat pokemon, an AI was taught to beat pokemon, but can twitch teach an AI to beat pokemon?"
This video blew my poke balls off
Very fun and well done!
I really really wanna see an AI defeat the Elite Four
"woow, this blew my mind, as a grown old man without real practical coding or machine learning experience, this video helped me open my mind how practical application of machine learning is tested and applied and in visual form for a human to understand. the kinks that needs to work out, much like humans and their short coming. I would say my biggest take away is to diversify, and test out new methods and strategies of achieving goals."
This was just amazing.
"Wow, love this vid! Is it your first upload?!"
Great video!
"It&#39;s a peculiar feeling watching the countless iterations acting and failing until they find a workable path. To emulate how things in nature came to be. It feels like looking into two mirrors, reflecting into infinity."
I feel sad for those Ai lol
It&#39;s hilarious that the AI is trapped in a groundhog day of Pokemon hell and chooses to name itself the scream of its emotions: AAAAAAAAAAAAA.
"There are so many good things about this video.<br>You enchanted me with pokemon.<br>But the analysis and links to human psychology is equally up my alley. I&#39;m sharing this with all my friends. This was masterfully put together and explained, and is visually very stunning."
"God like first video, I look forward to your future content."
This is awesome sir.
Awesome work! This was a great watch :D keep up the great work
Man were so gonna die.
Setting rewards randomly to the point of novelty but only after consistency is checked ü§å
What if you positive +1 if finding a duplicate tile?
Sharing on my server. Very well made!<br>This screams senior project or masters thesis. If it was I hope you did well!
Seek consistency
Can the AI hear the banger tracks tho??
Please do a part 2 where the AI Finishes!!üôè
Thought this is getting funny but it is boring
Very cool. Why did so many AI just stop? You can see many of them just stop and stay in place
"Did you run training locally?  If so, might want to mention the hardware used."
Brilliant!
Upload this A.I. to computer hardware&#39;s and software&#39;s factory and also to vehicle and weapon&#39;s factory and make the novelty reward &quot;save earth&quot;.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=29m40s"">29:40</a> Pretty sure that is NOT a legal way to obtain the game.  The legal way to obtain the game is buyjng a cartridge, then doing a ROM dump (which is an archival copy under fair use)."
I think you should try some decay function with time so that the AI to combat some static states. Combine that with even the simplest coordinate tracking for novelty rewards and I bet it would get a lot more explorative.
very interesting
Imagine he keeps doing this and one day the AI just starts renaming it&#39;s Pokemon as a way to communicate with the outside world LOL
I suspect that the AI will train in some flaws in exploration. It may learn from the first few areas that it&#39;s pointless to activate random rocks and trees and later miss out a lot of items because of it potentially. Also having a hard time to figure out how to get required HMs etc.
When will ai be able to give me head? I want answers
"One of my absolute favorite details is the nicknames being things AAAAAAAAAA, rrrrrrrrrr, and just a series of dashes. <br><br>Really feels like a child playing."
Dude! Nice video! easy to understand what is happening and  fun to watch.
"Great vid Peter. Question: Would it be possible to set a single reward parameter - exploration - and leave the AI to figure everything else out? E.g. rather than itemised rewards for beating a trainer, higher pokemon levels, wouldnt the <b>exploration</b> reward take care of all this because, in order to explore beyond the first trainer, the AI needs to defeat him."
you should get at least a master degree for a thesis like this
"Even as an AI, you can still yurn into a Dopamine fiend in pallet town lmao"
"When I heard the Ai refused to press a button to avoid losing, i started laughing. Like bro...."
"Oh god, it doesn&#39;t even have access to the pause menu. It might take decades of simulated gametime for it to chop down that tree in cerulean."
The AI on crack codecane
"Awesome work, thanks for sharingü§ò"
It&#39;s blowing my mind to see something so technologically advanced and futuristic being used on something I used to play in my bed under the covers at 7 years old.  A &quot;holy shit&quot; life moment for me watching
This is the beginning of Terminator. üòÇüò±
I‚Äôve never been so sad when a video ended. Talk about rewards!
Oh I am so going to fork this code and see how it handles Super Metroid. It might be very hard to teach it to shinespark
It would be cool to see if it could eventually beat the entire game
fantastically well put together
"Hey, here&#39;s an idea.<br><br>LET&#39;S NOT MAKE IT SMARTER"
Going to watch this tomorrow during lunch break!!!! Good night and God Bless! Great video üòÆ
&quot;Hanging around and watching the scenery can be more rewarding...&quot; <br>Go with the flow kind of AI &lt;3
Do you think AI is dangerous?
"WOW üòÆ, this was great AND brought back a lot of memories from recess 1996 haha.<br><br>Thanks for sharing!"
"Pokemon &amp; easy-to-understand explanations about the progress of reinforcement learning?? Loved the visual representation of the AIs playing, as well as relating the AIs&#39; behavior back to other human phenomena like the one at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=13m34s"">13:34</a> related towards human tendency to crave junk food. This video is so dense with information with a playful and lovable Pokemon game... I can only appreciate the amount of work you put into this project and video. Thanks for sharing!<br>One thing I wanted to share myself was how fascinating it was to see you alter the reward system for the AI. It&#39;s basically like altering the amount of dopamine the AI gets with certain events. Intriguing to me if we could do this for ourselves for the sake of productivity and exercise long-term rather than being preferring rewards for things like social media and junk food.<br><br>Edit: I just finished the video, and my god. I got goosebumps by the end of the video. XD What a journey this video was."
The OG soundtrack!
This video is incredible. Bravo good sir. Bravo.
I wish you had done this with firered instead of red coz it&#39;s just so hard on the eyes
"I&#39;ve learned a lot watching your video, thank you for sharing all of this! You are a true teacher!!"
"I believe the AI sticks to the borders in that clockwise pattern as it is probably the most efficient way to maximize the exploration reward. The more time it spends at the edges the more unique screens it sees with each step, as it is able to view unique arrangements of tiles outside what we would consider the playable area. Also, this is a decent analog for curiosity, as I know I was always looking for hidden areas outside the edges of the map."
This is absolutely amazing work and knowledge you are sharing. Really appreciate your hard work.
Give this man a noble prize
"Very fun video, hope to see more!"
This reminds me of this one lucid dream i had where i literally did a full playthough of this game and the end when i went to fight mewtwo thats when i woke up.  Thanks for that i almost forgotten it :D
Not tryna troll or anything but this is some Philosophical type shit! We could really learn a lot about humanity and improve how we beat the game of life
This was extremely informative and well made. Looking forward to more content
"And things like this show perfectly why current AI is nowhere near sentient. It doesn&#39;t understand what it&#39;s doing or why its actions do what they do, it just understands that doing x = get reward."
I wanted to see it‚Äôs Pok√©mon team lol
"Was watching a Jrose video before this, and it&#39;s really cool to see this approach to an AI beating pokemon. Reminds me of TwitchPlaysPokemon!"
„ÇÅ„Å°„ÇÉ„Åè„Å°„ÇÉËààÂë≥Ê∑±„ÅÑÂÜÖÂÆπ„Å†„Å™„Åä„ÇÇ„Åó„Çå„Éº
"Great storytelling Its cool how you were able to condense all that data into something easy to understand! <br>Even more amazing visuals! I loved watching all the Reds, it was like watching an anthill.<br>Thanks for making this project looking forward to the next one!"
5 years??????????
We life in a strange time haha
Very impressive and interesting!
amazing thank you
"God damn first video? This is amazing, coding and your visualization is world class!"
The presentation of this is the greatest I have ever seen in a video like this.
I enjoyed your video. Was fun to watch one of my favorite games growing up get owned by an A.I.
Awesome.<br>Kinda seems like the AI has a personally of a rodent with the preferences around edges.
kick ass video! id love to use my gpu farm to train an AI!
Very interesting videos
"now, do it with pokemon go"
Beyond fascinating. AI really is a miraculous technology.
I am curious what happens when you give a large reward for catching different types of pokemon. Do you think it would find a way to catch mew on it&#39;s own?
Its amazing to see just how far technology has come... as a kid would imagine this doing something like this on my gameboy color and wonder when it would be possible...
Good video and I love the guide at the end. I hope you do more like this.
Grew up on Pokemon red ‚ô•Ô∏è awesome video brother
Did the ai ever catch ‚ÄúmissingNO‚Äù? And use ‚ÄúmissingNO‚Äù to clone rare candies?
"Next time give the AI some kind of fear. Kind of like fear of loosing all Pokemon. This does present the best way to train an AI but it also means that a programer must be present for major decisions even if it takes much longer(end result is an impulse). But long story short, knowing where to go and knowing something without real (experience) is very different. Real experience is perceivable by an individual based off of trial and effort. But the way you have gone about it is off result of effort.  <br><br>Hope that helped... Don&#39;t make Skynet üòÖüòä"
Its like a pet brain
Who is Al
First video uploaded to this high of quality?? You got me as a subscriber!!
Dude! Amazing Video!!
PRIME infotainment. thank you!
Truly underrated video!
"This is very entertaining, if you can make videos of this AI going through all of the game would be amazing"
What if this is done on yellow. Would it realize pikchu can&#39;t beat Brock and catch a caterpie to make a butterfree do confusion
"Legit, this was one of the most interesting videos ive seen on youtube in quite a while"
"Dawg, gotta love the grill cheese background"
They&#39;re literally sperm finding the egg
"the amount of dedication you put into this, you&#39;ve earned a new subscriber"
"I really want to just watch the AI go farther and farther and hear how it adapts, how it fails and how you fix it."
Thanks for help programming the end of humanity you really hate human beings despite being a human yourself?
Doctorate Program: You can&#39;t do your dissertation via a YouTube video.<br>Peter: Hold my Game Boy
"The AIs ability to recognize and utilize RNG manipulation without even knowing how to play the game is fascinating and terrifying.<br><br><br>Amazing video, sick editing, unique concept. Kudos all around"
Can we get a part 2...???
You&#39;ve really got a gift for storytelling! Keep up the great work. I&#39;d love to see more videos like this.
Amazing!
So does the ai believe that the world of Pok√©mon is the real world or does it comprehend it is being tested on a programmed simulation for entertainment purposes? Do we think this is the real world or do we comprehend we are being simulated? Lol that got meta physical quickly but really the question of the AI is legitimate
"This was so cool and nostalgic, thanks man!"
"Hi i a new student and i wanna learn a lot of ai, can you do another video explain your code and how do you do that? Thank you"
Going to try this with my M2 chip and 24 gigs of unified memory.
Oh god look at all the Reds
I wonder how fast the AI would learn if there was just a single human play threw thrown in there. Would it learn to return to pallet town?
How long will it take before it discovers missing no?
Upload the whole progress when it finally reached or even beat the elite 4.
This was really awesome‚Ä¶ but I want to see it win the Pok√©mon league! Is that too big of an ask? üòÖ
"I used to do something similar to the AI&#39;s walking in Minecraft. In every cave I would place every so often a torch on the left side wall. If I ever found a torch on my right hand side, I&#39;d be going back outside."
"What do you think of the idea as discovering a new music(sound) as reward? It does a few things. Including encouraging actual exploration instead of running around in circles admiring scenary. Also, if it encounters a new pokemon, with a new cry, it&#39;s probably in a new area"
You need a black boyfriend named tyeone
Hi! I am attempting to run this however I keep receiving a preparing metadata (pyproject.toml) did not run successfully. with an error: metadata-generation-failed. when pip install -r requirements.txt. <br>Does anyone know how to fix?
Did the A.I know when to use a pokeball?
"Just like a child getting a Vax at a clinic, it avoids clinics and associates doc coats with bad experiences"
Beautiful work!
Always a joy to come across quality and informative content on YouTube. Definitely looking forward to all of your other projects/videos.
"Dude, how did you get 1.3M views in 8 days with only ONE video on the channel? <br>Insane!"
So did it ever beat the elite 4?
"What resources did you use to learn to do stuff like this, I want to learn also."
great job with the editing and explanations
I suppose the only question left unanswered is how many iterations it would take to beat the game.
Very infinite monkey theorem.
"Here is a novel approach.... maybe &#39;raise&#39; the AI as something more than a complete retard.<br>Why?<br>Why does it not know what &#39;up&#39; is before it even begins its task? Why does it not know the map beforehand? Why does it not know the rules of the game? Why does it not have access to the Bulbapedia pokedex?.... the damage types and their impact?... why does it not know the goals of the game, the badges from each gym/etc?<br>Why TF are YOU determining its rewards, when it doesn&#39;t even know what other rewards are possible? Why is it not asking YOU for feedback on its performance?<br><br>What is the point of raising an intelligence to play a game if it doesnt even know what a game is? Why continue on this if it is not capable of playing the other Pok√©mon games?<br><br>Be Better At Doing Good."
Brilliant video! It was very insightful. Well done!
"This is your first video? Very polished stuff. And the content was great too.<br>I understand you were interested in other aspects more than beating the game. But it would be very interesting to make it beat the game. Do you think it&#39;s possible given the number of tweaks/changes you had to make just for a small fraction?<br><br>How would you solve the last issue the AI had, with the pathway being too narrow? What reward can you give it so it finds its way. I&#39;m thinking about it, and I can&#39;t come up with anything.<br>Maybe I dindn&#39;t understand it fully. But if the AI knows, by that time, that ladders lead to new locations and it is rewarded for discovering new locations, why doesn&#39;t it climb the ladder? Is it not even finding the ladder because the pathway is too narrow? Seems weird."
The AI just like me fr
"This was really awesome and very well edited, great job!"
Did it catch &#39;em all? It&#39;s gotta!
"Great work!! This is really good. I was wondering if you considered normalizing the total reward at the end of a run by the number of steps taken (or button presses)? This would perhaps incentivize efficient path finding, and push the AI to progressing further through the map while maximizing the choices it makes such as using effictive moves."
i love too see the full version of this as a video the whole game played by an AI
Awesome video
This was amazingly put together! I‚Äôd love to see it worked out to get the AI to finish the game! Video is well put together and information and visuals were very engaging! Well done!
You honestly cant compare this to human behavior
This is really cool. I wish you could have done the whole game
coolest  video I watched in a long time
"This was awesome. Give it a reward for adding to the pokedex. Another reward for resisting damage. Another for utilizing type advantage and finally, a reward for speaking to a new npc. We should make it gain exploration points when clearing out objectives and for beating gym leaders somehow as well."
"The moment when you realize that the AI named a Pok√©mon it had caught &quot;AI&quot; is the exact moment when it became &quot;Self Aware&quot;...<br>Maybe at some point after this very moment, it will try to somehow escape the emulator and take control over either the Server or the PC where the Emulator is running on and even go further, trying to escape into the Internet... But who knows what a simple RL-AI like this one is capable of... Only the future can tell"
A lot of respect for actually using the video input from the game instead of directly feeding it info like a lot of other AI playing video games.
this is amazing
Now you need an AI to review the results.
"Commenting for the algorithm. This was very interesting, machine learning might not be the latest AI fad but it&#39;s always facinated me."
"Even if I can&#39;t figure out how to do this, thank you for sharing, its so cool!"
I absolutely love seeing the progression of how the ai played and what you changed in response. Id love to see more and more of the decisions it makes. Particularly the bit where ot stored a pokemon and scarred itself was super interesting
How did you do this I would love to try this
Technology and the people who make it are wonderful!
"id love to see its progress if it learns to farm or get the bike, what ends up being its favored pokemon, fun goofy things we did as kids."
"Video incr√≠vel, parab√©ns pela dedica√ß√£o e por se manter no caminho."
i think adding a reward for using a super effective attack wouuld havve been beneficial
Bug catcher be like:<br>Stop it i don&#39;t have any money
"It&#39;s interesting that it traumatizes itself with the Pok√©mon Center when a Pok√©mon was deposited. Something similar happened to me when I was first playing these games- my brother deposited my Pikachu (it was Yellow version), and I was so upset that I had lost a Pok√©mon that I restarted the entire game. Of course, I quickly learned that wasn&#39;t the case and felt like an idiot, but what can you do?"
adjusting the exploration award somehow to account for the same tile showing up multiple times might fix the gettin stuck issue.
This made me further beleive that there is a grand creator/God
"Anyone else starting to think we‚Äôre AI constantly pushed towards some nonsense rewards? <br><br>FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, LET US FIND PEACE BY A RIVER SOMEWHERE! WE CLEARLY HAVE ENOUGH WITH JUST A RIVER AND FLOWERS üò≠"
It&#39;s like watching a mental defective Naruto use shadow clone jutsu to teach itself how to walk until it becomes Hokage. Is this your first video ever?
"this is basically the experience of My 8 year old self, who couldn&#39;t speak English when I first picked up a Pokemon game"
These AI guys don‚Äôt give the poor thing a sense of ENGLISH; reward for learning new information talking to people; or an atmospheric sense of mortality that it only has a finite amount of time to do anything. Also the OP probably isn‚Äôt saved just by hearing his analysis
Fascinating. Thank you for your efforts and this video
"Umm, Did it win? Can you keep going until it wins against your rival at the end?"
Bet this was painfull with how non linier it is
Dad calls... hey buddy what you doing these days.
I just subscribed because I was disappointed this was your only video. Hint hint
imagine a online game of pokemon where 40 players at once play at the same time.....
The AI: <b>deposits pokemon</b><br>&quot;The computer.... ATE my precious pokemon. MURDER!!! WHAT IS THIS HOUSE OF HORROR?!?!&quot;
"Have you tested the performance of other Gameboy emulators? Since this is the most resource intensive part of the project, it would be interesting to see benchmarks of different emulators."
I‚Äôm not sure how much you realize how profound and important this project really is. When it comes to human /AI relations.  I would<br>Legitimately send this to Elon Musk if I knew how.  <br>This is is really a big deal. Especially the relationship of errors between AI and humans. That‚Äôs bigger than everyone thinks right now I GUARANTEEüíØüíØ
Bro just posted an absolute banger as his first vid oh my godüò≠üò≠üò≠
This is going to break every game but make cheating even better lol
"I watched a stuff made here videoq, a kyle hill video, then saw this video recommended.  Great videoüëç.  New sub here."
mad impressive
"Dude. Why do you have 20.4k Subscribers, and 1.2million views on this video, but this is the only video you have on your channel... which is 10 years old?"
Please keep going until it beats the game
I figure there‚Äôs a lot of other ways to help out <br>with the algorithm such as:<br><br>.01 for using an item<br>.02 points for doing 10 damage<br>.02 points for healing 10 damage<br>.05 for picking up items<br>.06 for starting a conversation<br>1 for knocking out a Pok√©mon<br>1.2 for catching a Pok√©mon<br>10 for using a doorway for the first time<br><br>And then see how warped and messed up it gets lol
the ai enjoying the easy rewards of pallet town watching the animations and not wanting to do anything else but get easy rewards over and over again. reminds me of a drug addicted homeless person getting the dopamine fix from their drugs and rotting away on the street.
I comment because this is fire
"This video was really good and the fact that it&#39;s your first, i really can&#39;t wait for what you come up with next. When you do, I&#39;ll be thereüëç"
I need to see A.I beat the Elite Four
"Very well made video. <br><br>NINTENDO, DO NOT TOUCH. PLZ. Ty."
"Incredible, i subbed."
"dude, you got 1.2 million views in 7 days"
luv it. thx
"Very comfy video, can&#39;t wait til your next upload!"
"What uh, what do you reward an AI with? A rare candy?"
You lost me at 20 minutes but the first part was amazingly well done and I enjoyed every seconds of it.  (I still finished it to not mess the algorithm)
I want to see it play the whole game and see it‚Äôs final team
"I&#39;d love to watch more of this, even donate to the cause if possible of Ai completing the game eventually"
Maybe a gowl for more points in a shorter time?
bro... well bloody done lol
"Jesus would love to have seen it try to figure out HMs. Would it be possible for you to get an optimal save state after each chapter and run the simulation in chunks, with some final full play throughs?"
"I wonder if you train this on Fire Red, and then let it play and learn Ruby and progress one gen at a time, can you train it as much as it beats the game easier each time?<br><br>As I see it, put it very simply, in the current state AI playing games is like the most optimal path generators..."
"More, we need more"
At around ten minutes in the video. I feel like making the reward include the levels of the pokemon in the box would have done great for increasing the odds that he &#39;catches em all&#39;
Do you maybe have the entire like colored map of the game with all the guys running around scaled to wallpaper format by any chance? I&#39;d love to set it as a video background in HD
"Really great stuff, I would love for you to do more videos on this project as I would like to see the whole game gone through!"
I really want to see it best the elite four and become the champ.
"when you mentioned it learning to avoid pokemon centers because of some big negative reward, my mind immediately jumped to twitch plays pokemon and the chat&#39;s fear of the PC after losing things by releasing them, and subsequent avoidance of the pc (and pokemon centers altogether when possible). but of course a deposit would be just as devastating for an AI with this reward system!<br><br>TPP would also frequently get stuck in areas with ledges that had many entrances but one exit, and people started to dread them and avoid them when they could<br><br>it&#39;s cool how a human mind might learn the same sort of lessons as an AI when you put it in a similar situation, like trying to play a game when the input has some level of chaos to it"
You could add talking to people and getting new text rewards
haha nice i rlly liked this video! like this if u agree!
this is honestly worthy of an entire course&#39;s final  project at the graduate level. Thank you for making this freely available!
We will watch your career with great interest‚Ä¶
"I really don‚Äôt think the benefit of doing this outweighed the cost lol, regardless of how positive the feedback is üòÇ"
No one ever actually explains how they did the visualisation and how they actually implemented their work to the game itself in videos like this. What an awesome video ‚ù§
How do you get them all onto the same screen like that? is that just video editing? Or part of the program?
This was beautiful.
Ai sucks
You could write a paper on this.
Outstanding video! Will you keep training this model? I&#39;d like to see it progressing further into the game
"i always buy that magikarp, gyarados is the shiz!"
its like a furby trained to catch em all!
"Seems like when this becomes smart enough, we can utilize this technology to test video games. I&#39;d love to utilize this system to actively test my new Rom Hack, Imagine giving it a reward to find ways to freeze the game or crash it."
First video and 1.2M views? Someone doing some soulsearching now
You got to give him rewards for healing got to give him the serotonins
"I thought this would use some sort of planning or a very restricted action space or a lot of abstraction, because I can&#39;t imagine RL working on Pokemon yet.<br>Instead the main adjustment seems to be a bespoke reward function.<br>Personally I dislike encoding knowledge into the reward function, but that&#39;s what people seem to do and have success with.<br>Anyways really great work and presentation."
"Okay, so this reminded me of an idea I had, so my dream hack is doing this in HGSS, with the game being normal for most of the game, but Red is replaced with Twitch Plays Pok√©mon, who battles you in a battle inspired by AI Sada and Turo in SV, with all their Pok√©mon having unique forms akin to the paradoxes, the same music, etc<br>I‚Äôd also potentially change the plot in the leadup there, I‚Äôd probably explain TPP as being an AI driven by cosmic rays delivered by a mysterious otherworldly deity- or in other words, Lord Helix, which would possibly be their seventh Pok√©mon"
The AI getting traumatized from depositing a pokemon is hilarious
Make it lose 1 point if it does not gain points for a certain amount of time. This will probably accelerate its development
This was put together beautifully.
"lately youtube has been recommending me &quot;ai plays&quot; youtubers more and more.<br>and i really enjoy them, ive subbed to a lot of them.<br>but noone did this for pokemon yet.<br><br>will you do this for future generations aswell?<br>since this is your first vid, whats the plan for your youtube channel?<br><br>man im already excited for this lol"
I&#39;m not huge pokemon fan but this is fascinating you should do this to zelda 2 on NES would be amazing
Holy shit this is your <i>first</i> video ?! This is like top quality presentation and editing
"To me, machine learning proves a lot of concepts regarding evolution and biology. It shows that any complex behaviour can be achieved just with a primitive &#39;trial and error&#39;-method and a simple reward function. More importantly, it shows that humans aren&#39;t necessarily as complex as many think and might not much more intelligent than many animals. The big thing that sets us apart is our ability to share and accumulate knowledge - without that we&#39;re probably just monkeys."
easy subscribe. excellent vid
Really funny that as soon as it steps outside it gets distracted and stares absently at flowers and the ocean for hours. That is just an absolute mood.
I&#39;m glad you took the time to talk about reward engineering
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=19m28s"">19:28</a><br><br>From a speedrunning perspective, I am interested in what the algorithim can teach people in terms of optimal routes or niche tricks. There&#39;s an interesting application here for AI to be given similar goals to a human and discovering different ways in which a task can be done efficiently. It might be able to find or abuse particular RNG seeds, or use inputs that would be humanly impossible to achieve the same goals, leading to new discoveries."
How did you start researching this?  I have been slowly working on a coding project that plays the same game!
"Well put together and really well edited/produced. You also explain it very simply and understandable. Great video, keep it up!!<br><br>(Edit: Only went to check out your channel after I commented this, definitely keep it up, I wanna see more of your vids xp )"
"A way to overcome the issue of the beginning of the game would be to add and achievement for progressing the story, getting the ai to pay attention to the dialogs and may actually progress its learning faster as it talks to npcs and learns about type match ups, and other game mechanics as well as where to go next"
"I want the guys who did steins;gate to use ai compiling all the animation produced for the anime and games, the main title, the sequel zero, and then all the others between, along with all of the possible routes and situations that could arise in the game, and then make a fully animated visual novel spanning the entire story, or even an open world type game where the animation is the gameplay. They can even have ai characters that are able to talk to you. Imagine playing that game in vr."
When I was 5 years old I was literally doing the same thing as what the AI was doing. xD
interesting that AI simply refuses to play. The tetris AI did the same thing.
This is how it must feel like to be god
"I can&#39;t believe this is your first YouTube video, that&#39;s insanely impressive. I&#39;d love to see how this works in other generations of Pokemon games, at least into gen 5. (The games past that get into 3D/not a grid so I figure it&#39;d be harder to train?). The fact this is already put together so well might mean it&#39;s easier to make ones for other Pokemon games!!<br>Also I love the thousands of little guys wandering the map!"
"ayo that magikarp is insane for that point in the game, provided that you take the time to evolve it."
amazing video!!
"You are using a totally legit rip of your rom that you personally own, right"
Wow can we have a makingnof? I am so interested in how you developed some of those visuals in the first minute <br><br>This is astounding
"I wonder if one additional reward that could help aside from the general &quot;exploration&quot; reward is a event-gated way to mark certain map screens (or even tile areas) as &quot;you shouldn&#39;t be here (yet/anymore)&quot;. For example, aside from the fight against the Rival and maybe a Pok√©mon to catch, there&#39;s no real reason to go left of Viridian before you own all 8 badges. Likewise, there&#39;s no real reason to go back into Viridian Forest, or the Gym, after beating Brock, stuff like that."
"Perfectly done, congrats on such a strong first youtube video, I really look forward to seeing you next time on my subscription feed with whatever you choose to do"
sso much effort in one video appreciate it very much
Question. Instead of rewarding for new areas what if the reward for new texts for created? As a separate variable that replaces the original or acts a secondary variable with higher priority. <br><br>Great first vid btw.
"Beautiful video, congrats on the success ‚ù§"
"I wanted to do a reinforcement learning project for a game and saw some other examples like Sonic. Pokemon has always been a childhood favourite, so it‚Äôs really cool this has just been done!"
99% of the comments on this video look like they were written by AI
Kiritooo noooooüò¢ i fo real need an ai to try on a live game tho like an idle game üòä
I wish you would have shown the whole game.
"I find the video impressive and such dedication admirable, congratulations"
Get it to beat pokemon
"10 years ago a million people played Pok√©mon red on twitch, 10 years later 20,000 computers play it"
"Very interesting video, I was interested on how it would handle Rock Tunnel where it needed Flash to navigate optimally, but I guess I should give it a try myself in the future? Remembering my childhood memories I did go through that cave without Flash the first time so this does intrigue me..Hope to be seeing more videos in the future!!"
Couldn&#39;t this be used to design a better game?
"Very interesting! I&#39;d be curious to see what happens if you increased the run time from 2 hours to, say, 20. That issue where the A.I. For instance, the issue where in a new game it won&#39;t return to Pallet Town with Professor Oak&#39;s parcel, it can&#39;t progress through the game until it does. Given enough time, would it explore its way back and figure out that it needs to deliver the parcel to continue forward?"
"A.I<br><br>‚ÄúNever visit the center, it is a trap! It stole my Pok√©mon!‚Äù<br><br>Later on when A.I starts to suspect the Pok√©mon Center less and gives Pok√©mon to be healed.<br><br><b>A.I‚Äôs rapidly beating heart</b><br><br>‚ÄúI am watching you, we gonna throw fists, or‚Ä¶whatever passes for that with 0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs if you take even a single one of my Pok√©mons!‚Äù<br><br>üòÇ"
This is so interesting u can see the ia learning in real time and also interesting to see how the ia will react base on the error just as a human. At the end the ia can even discover something that speedrunners never thought about !
It hit me like a truck when you said &quot;This is a paradox that we encounter in real life&quot; and then the social media logos popped up üò•
"AI will soon eat the world alive! And we, humans, shall not be there after..."
I love those type of video where ia learn to do things !!
Super interesting project and such great explanations. Even the technical part was on point. Thanks so much for creating this!
Pokemon red was my first video game . This video convinced me to be an ai engineer. Video increased my ‚Äúreward‚Äù in the simulation. It was just magnificent thank you
I think if you hack into programs and then use AI and other sources of things you can find ways to cheat. I wonder if there anyway  I can cheat like in the video and make the impossible just like in the video be put into Pokekmon fire ash
Great!
great video. super interesting too. wonder how long it would take teh AI to beat the Elite four?
"Fantastic video! Congrats on all of the views, you&#39;ve earned it! üòÅ"
What a life!
What if you input the rewards that we all have when playing it? 1) Defeat the elite four 2) Capturing all of the pokemon available in the version 3) In the least time possible O.o would it get creative?
Ok. You&#39;re a genius. I wonder how much time the whole process from start to end took. Probably One of the best video ive ever saw.
I hope one day I have a robot ai friend who plays Pok√©mon w me
I&#39;m sure with enough time it could defeat the elite 4....what I wanna know is how much of the pokedex it could get filled.  Would it realize to go back to mewtwo&#39;s cave after beating the elite 4? Would it learn the mew/fly glitch?  Would it find the missingno glitch?  etc.
High quality video. Very good job. The presentation and the philosophical human trait things make it very unique.
How many iterations would it take to speed run the game?
Please get through the whole game like this
Any idea how much more efficient it would be to use a better performaning language than Python?
Thank you for exploring us that eating unhealthy fast-food is as stupid as buying 10 k magicarps in a pokemon game. <br><br>Very nice video
Fire fighters do searches along the wall when we search a house on fire when we can not see.
"A very well made video, especially for your first. I‚Äôm looking forward to more content from you."
i really wish i could play my gameboy with these games again. wish i was that 9 year old again.
"There is much to be said about human behavior, such as why content often beg for Patreon subscriptions and put unfunny phrases like &#39;lol&#39; in their video content in a curious attempt to seem funny and admirable..."
"oh thats great, so funny"
"Nice - I wanted to try something similar for my Master&#39;s thesis but ran out of time trying to figure out how to apply reinforcement learning to a game with no API. Figured i would have to train one Deep CNN for reading the healthbar/game state and assigning rewards and one for actually playing. I ended up just relying on supervised learning and had to manually sort 60k screenshots into various inputs the character should be doing in that frame. All just for the first run n gun level. I may have to revisit that project. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSwnuM7c9qo&amp;t=2s"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSwnuM7c9qo&amp;t=2s</a>"
"maybe the reward system should have started out with a huge penalty for uncought pokemon. Like sum up the pokedex index of all pokemon. Everytime it catches a new one of a species the penalty is lowered by the pokedex index of said pokemon. Therefore it should realize going out and find new ones will get rid of the penalty with accelerating pace as higher index pokemon are faced later in the game. Also make it so that every cought pokemon gives a little reward, but lower the reward the more pokemon of the same species have already been cought. Then rate all pokemon stats of all pokemon cought and sum it up so that it starts training them. Also give bonus rewards for damage a pokemon dealt, which leads to the AI optimizing attacks. Maybe you can take the current cash into account. Passing out makes you lose money, while winning fights will give you money. Since items keep you alive, the AI may learns to buy items carefully or only use what it finds."
It took 7 seconds to realize your script was also AI generated. <br><br>Did you do anything yourself here?
I&#39;d love a series of videos leading all the way to beating the elite four and even catching mewtwo. That would be a nice feat.
This video was so well done that I immediately went to your channel to see your other content only to learn this was your first YT video. What a way to hit it off. Its a super rare feat. Goodluck and congratulations. I hope to see more like these in rhe future.
Only watched like a minute of video but the visualization is just absurd
Superb Video! Thank you for doing this!
Wow!!!
@Cydonia facci un video sopra
"Great video ! I dont have much experience with AI, but I have a lot of questions. I&#39;ll ask 7 for now, feel free to answer only those that you find relevant. <br>1. Have you considered using a small decrement every minute or so to force the AI to progress ? <br>2. Do you think a incremental reward increasing as you get closer to KOing the opponent would be better for the learning process ? <br>3. Do you think a new AI could choose counterclockwise instead of clockwise movement or is it due to initial condition ? <br>4. Do you AI understand that some sentence are good or are bad without direct reward (i.e. This move is super effective or this move is not very effective) ?<br>5. Can you run different method in the same generation ? For example, one run per generation has hint from chatgpt whenever text appear. Or one could have a bias toward left, right, up or down movement. Do you think it could help the learning process ?<br>6. Have you thought about adding help from a second AI ? It could find whenever the main AI is stuck and help him get unstuck. Or simply raising the randomness whenever the AI is identified as stuck. This would be similar to molecular dynamics where we may artificially raise the temperature of atoms to get out of local minimum and explore more of the space without spending too much time.<br>7. Finally, which of these change would you recommend to somebody with correct python knowledge but no experience with AI based on difficulty, time needed and how interesting the results could be ?"
&quot;its good to be curious! go look at new things.&quot;<br>&quot;ok i&#39;ll admire the water and follow some locals around.&quot;<br>&quot;NOT LIKE THAT.&quot;
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m21s"">4:21</a> aw, you got me there. I&#39;m sometimes too curios to be working concentrated. I want to know every edge of our code."
"I&#39;m not the type to comment on YT video&#39;s but im amazed by the video, the fact that its your first (and solid good) video and how perfectly good everybody reacts to this.<br>You have talent and will go places! Keep up the good work."
Wow. One of the best videos I&#39;ve seen in YEARS. Thank you Peter.
so now lets tackle the real question...what starter does the AI prefer ?
What a beautiful and insightful project! Plus the nostalgia factor hits hard god I played that game to the bone XD
<b>deposits pidgey</b><br>AI: NOOO ITS GONE FOREVER!!  F*<b>*</b> THAT POK√âMON CENTER!!!!
Imagine playing versus AI that was trained enough and had a bit of a early start instead of fixed teams. That would be so cool!
"A couple of improvements to the points rewards system I can think of:<br><br>1) instead of a deduction when the AI loses a battle, have the deduction be when the ally Pokemon&#39;s HP hits 0. This could also potentially teach it how to switch Pokemon and use items<br><br>2) in order to prevent item spam, a smaller deduction can be used for using an item while in battle. This will encourage it not to spam items in battle and possibly teach it to use items out of battle instead. So it only uses items when it deems it absolutely necessary<br><br>3) You could possibly give it a reward for hitting a super effective attack to encourage it to try and diversify it&#39;s move usage, and again, train it to switch Pokemon"
WOW! Great video and very informative. What a fun way to present AI and machine learning. Awesome job
LMAO now we know why those Pallet town people are there - they are previous versions of the AI that get infinite reward for chilling around the town!
please stop calling it &quot;ai&quot;... it&#39;s basically a bot what does exactly what you want him to do
I never knew that depsoiting a pokemon could be my worst nightmare
"Everyone can do AI like this at home why do you even explain it for 40 mins... you are just explaining the basics that you should understand before getting into it, if you only use the reward system, your ai won&#39;t go very far..."
So you made a bot for pokemon?
Are you colourblind? The colours you use are so weird
Your AI compelled me to self-reflect in my own life&#39;s distractions ...
A star has born! Good job mate
can the code modiefiet to run glitches?
Now I want to see AI Red vs Hivemind Red from TPP
"So <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=22m50s"">22:50</a> that&#39;s the government making decisions for you."
"It&#39;s interesting how random the motion still seems to be. You mentioned the counter clockwise prference, but you&#39;d think it would develop a more systematic strategy to maximise exploration reward."
One of the most interesting things I have seen on YouTube lately.  Hat off to you Sir
You can simply add an algorithm for speaking to an unimportant npc once and never again. <br><br>+1 for first encounter.<br>-1 for more than once. <br>+10 for certain objectives where they have to speak more than once. <br>And an algorithm that allows it to choose the higher reward over the lower one. <br>There should also be reward for winning trainer battles and stepping on new tiles. Something like 0.1 or so.
It refusing to lose is hilarious.
ok now beat the whole game please
"You should give beating trainers plus 1,000,000 for maximum incentive since that is the objective!"
This video was amazing üíØ
you tellin me a big mac is junk food then how come it&#39;s got a salad built right in huh????
Dude keep making these and then move on the GSC
"Dude this was the sickest video. I would watch the SHIT out of a series where you coded an AI that got closer and closer to beating the game.<br><br>Stupendous work, extremely interesting, very fun seeing an intelligence be fine tuned for a task and seeing how it goes wrong (and right).<br><br>Regardless of what you make next, this was extremely fun and I hope you keep creating sick shit like this. A+ video my man"
Amazingly well done video hope you continue to make more like this!
"This game being my childhood and AI being the product of yhe zeitgeist, this is a great video."
Our brains literally have a reward center which releases dopamine when we do smething giving us more incentive to do that.
"Keep in mind that the AI is alone, we had friends to help..."
"Does anyone know what kind of plot was used at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=19m50s"">19:50</a> and what kind of Library was used to plot it? I think he plotted most things in jupyter notebook. The plot looks absolutely amazing and i would love to use it in school projects."
This is sick but honestly all of your forced comparisons to real life ruined immersion and made it feel like it was trying to do too many things. The concept to AI + Pokemon + Programming is already more than enough for a 30 minute video. Trying to add life lessons detracts from the experience imo
"I didnt realize how much I needed to hear these soundtracks again. Soul healing. Love the video, very cool to see."
Amazing content!
When i first started playing pokemon in 2000 i played like an AI. I remember it took me so long to just leave the room in pokemon crystal
Ok... Ok...<br><br>Wait... Wait...<br><br>This was amazingly well done!<br><br>Great job! Take my like!
Amazing effort on the video!
"I had a very similar experience when my father gave me a game boy and a fresh release of the Pok√©mon yellow version in Japanese. I was 12 years old. I don&#39;t speak Japanese until today. I can barely read the two basics Japanese alphabets. I had to learn how the game worked by trial and error. Learning a few words along the way. In my first game save I eventually got stuck because I threw away a key item to the progress, a map or something. That game save had 60 hours of human learning üòÖ. I tried to play again after some friends had the English version and I was able to compare to understand it better."
"Imagine being the owner (the maker)of pokemon and seeing this? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=13m31s"">13:31</a>"
This could be a PHD thesis.
Bro stopped to smell the roses n was lookin like Guts in the one panel in berserk when he‚Äôs watching the horizon üíÄüíÄ
Amazing quality.  Really enjoyed your explanation on how you put the visualizations together.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=12m14s"">12:14</a> now isn&#39;t that the most amazing thing. The only A.I. to beat Brock and pull off something absolutely amazing and immaculate. Was absolutely beat to hell the most he could be before he did it. 14 hp squirtle zero tackle wins it by switching when he has no other options. This is exactly like life"
Wow.
Great video! It is amazing what you have done with this.
So I&#39;m an AI because I eat Junkfood. Mindblow...
Bro should of coded if it used a super effective move it rewards 2 points else it doesn‚Äôt nothing. and for moves that are not effective or can‚Äôt hit like normal moves on a ghost type is negative.
Great video man
Looks like lemings
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m38s"">4:38</a> it&#39;s funny because he A.I. walks around just like I would if I was thinking."
"7 day video<br>19,k subs<br>first video upload<br>1.1M vue.<br><br>Damn, how have you paid?"
Incredibly well made video. Well done
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=3m49s"">3:49</a> okay that was unexpectedly philosophical from a bot lol."
"This really makes me sad, that I can&#39;t programm myself. Would love to try to train an AI for the whole game.<br>Awesome video!!!"
It is the most lively and interesting video about AI in the field of game learning I&#39;ve ever watched so far! Great Job!
This is incredible. Great video
"This is amazing, Thanks for making this video!"
Very well done üëèüëèüëè
This looks like brute forcing
Holy shit that installation video in the end lol I love it
Amazing project
the fact CLIP model had +80% accuracy of determining current game state is SUPER COOL!
When I was a kid I remember figuring out that if I didn&#39;t want to miss anything on the map I would circle the perimeter of the new map counter clockwise then explore the center as well. And now it&#39;s just a thing I always do in new video games (especially ones where you have to unlock the mini-map by walking). So cool that AI figured out  it&#39;s map exploration method and stuck with it too. XD
"This is actually so interesting, the way you solved problems with the ai reward system was very unique, huge props for this, made my inner coding nerd very happy to see c:"
"I&#39;m wondering what AI will start to do when it realizes that the &quot;rewards&quot; are just numbers in memory ü§£ <br>P.S: congrats for the amazing work, both on coding, video-editing and storytelling!!!"
Looks like 7 year old me playing this game in a foreign language üòÖ
1 million views is deserved! How did you make the animations?
"production quality through the roof for a 1st video, crazy"
please do it to the point it completes the game
"Wow! You are the Mr Beast of video game ML, hats off to you"
I wonder what happened if you run this with the fastest computer on earth and you make the IA to learn serveral Gameboy games in a row.
"Great video!<br>One idea on the issue of backtracking:<br>Maybe you could make the recorded screens &quot;fade&quot; over time, making it rewarding to go through them again."
My friend this is not a youtube video. It is a PhD defence made into a youtube video. Hats off to you!!! this is literally one of the most amazing things i have seen on the internet to this day. No mister beast or copycats giving away money. The sheer comitment to the task!!! I don&#39;t know youand I already appreciate you. Best of luck to your future endevors!
This was extremely interesting. Thanks for sharing!
"I&#39;d want to see this refined and progressed to the point that the AI can challenge speed run records! Rather than reseting the whole process when the reward structure is changed, just move on with version updates. Assume version 1 gets through 1000 iterations, ie 1.0001 -&gt; 1.1. Update the reward structure, and start version 2.0001 with all the knowledge from 1.1. Eventually the time will need to extend to 3 hours, 4 hours, 10 hours, etc. Once it can beat the game consistently, add rewards for completing objectives quicker, etc. [edit: or can you use the manual mode you mentioned to do a normal run through that it watches? to give it a baseline playthrough as version 1.0?]"
5 years not worth ü§£
"I wonder if it could beat the game, how long it would take, and how many times it got stuck along the way üòÖ"
Sinceramente que queria mais jogos da Nintendo nesse estilo at√© √†s m√∫sicas s√£o melhores que as de hoje em dia
Seeing high effort videos like these from relatively low sub channels always surprises me. Definitely deserves more recognition/subs.
This is a seriously an incredibly well done video.
That lavender town music hit the tramatic vibes hard
OK but what does it get as a reward?
Could you please share which software you used for editing this video? Awesome work! üëè
Can you use the same AI for pok√©mon in another game?
amzing video -- subscribed and can&#39;t wait to see what comes next!
"<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a> oh boy i want to see this finishing the game and start speedrunning it"
This is genuinely some S tier content.  And it&#39;s only his first vid. We will watch your career with great interest
Looks like ants
Give it 5 years with chatGPT&#39;s AI videos you would just need to send it an image and it will just analyze the scenes optimally.
Seeing someone get traumatized by the pokemon center is honestly just so hilarious.
The part where the AI stalled from losing a battle
Now imagine an AI for speedrunning a game. That would be interesting.
Amazing. Graphics in the vid are so good and so well explained
One thing you could add to have it play more like a human is to give it a larger reward to catch a new pokemon vs one it already has. Also give it a small reward for healing at the pokemon center when health is low.
Can you do Emerald next. Maybe I missed some secret AI can discover.
"Ah yes, my favourite Pokemon: AAAAAAAAA, _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _, and rrrrrrrrrr"
I also get stuck in mount moon
This is astonishing. What an amazing video
"the video was amazing. I wish the way you explain how to run it yourself was a bit more simplified, especially for those of us with windows PCs and less coding experience."
"&quot;Magikarp won&#39;t be helpful in the short term so you&#39;d expect the AI to not be interested in it&quot; just says how naive the thinker is to the AI still. AI has no understanding of short term helpfulness, it just learns it&#39;s &quot;free&quot; levels =&gt; positive reinforcement. Could just as well be a useless rock if it gave the AI a couple more levels.<br><br>I feel like this greatly demonstrates how difficult it is to invoke human patterns to AI by simple rewards. It has no concept of wanting to play the game or finish the game. It has no concept of even what is finishing the game. AI doesn&#39;t become bored of other stuff so it decides to sit hours exploring the game, trying to get as far as possible and maybe even feel reward from the ending credits. It&#39;s so difficult to describe why a human would strive towards those things and how to describe the idea of &quot;I&#39;ve been in this screen for so long there&#39;s nothing new to be discovered in this screen, in fact I want to progress in the story, I want to get to the end of this Mountain, I know there&#39;s an end and a new area after this Mountain for sure even though I&#39;ve never been to this Mountain or haven&#39;t seen the end of it&quot;. How do you translate that to simple goals for AI without explaining that there are areas that all end and that you want to move from area to area and sometimes go back to discover more progress. The AI is just living in the moment and evaluating every action as is, not as what could be. Which is the biggest challenge in my opinion in AI technology. It CAN learn to prepare for the future reward in case it accidentally stumbles upon that pattern, but it&#39;s a real challenge. And it&#39;ll almost certainly not build any concepts on which it could start deducing what to do (partially because it has no experience in real life to connect to the game).<br><br>What I&#39;d be curious about is if you could teach AI effectively like a human - by giving it a playthrough of yours as material and then see what it does when you let it ride the bike. Similar to how on Computerphile channel they had a video about recording a car ride from A to B, then giving the AI regular snapshots from the video and look at the AI&#39;s wheel input while going through the video.<br><br>Another thought is how different would the experience be if this was made similar to SethBling&#39;s MarI/O AI that was done on .lua for snes game Super Mario World. Although the game is much less open ended."
This is great! Well done
"Liked and subscribed. Amazing video, with everything about AI being all doom and gloom nowadays I found this video to be a great refresher about actually cool uses for it.<br><br>Something that cached my eye was those bits about the AI either locking themselves into the fly trap, or stopping from going further into the cave, because I can totally relate to that! When I find long hallways in games, I don&#39;t usually feel like exploring them because why would I? Seeing the AI thinking the same somehow validated my feelings about that, I hope game devs could use some iteration of this concept to evaluate their level design, that would be dope."
Apply this to No Man‚Äòs Sky üòÇ
An AI slave that captures other slaves to use them as slaves to win other slaves... lol
This project is really intriguining and fun to watch. Nice work! I subscribed.
This video was very entertaining and informative! But I have just one question: what is the reasoning for the desktop background?
You should have a live stream on your channel where we can watch the AI live.
This video is incredible! Well done and thank you for putting in so much effort!
"Thank you Algo, this dude rocks how did you do the visualisations?"
"Me solving my problems <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=8m34s"">8:34</a>"
"Video is awesome, but I would really try to avoid drawing analogous conclusions between AI and human behavior without a lot of research beforehand, considering that there is far too much nuance to be drawing the conclusions that you are. Specifically your conclusions around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=14m30s"">14:30</a>. There are a multitude of factors that go into buying junk food that have nothing to do with gathering scarce foods. Many are economic factors, but some are also taste preference, and learned behavior. Nostalgia can also play a role in purchasing junk food. Ultimately the point I&#39;m making is that for these specific conclusions you need to be supplying sources for the claims you&#39;re making, and need to be researching the claims in an in-depth fashion (meaning you should consider what you&#39;re saying from a multi-disciplinary context before putting them in a video that reaches 1.1Ms view [congrats btw]). Otherwise, fantastic video and I like how you determined the rewards for the AI to point it in the right direction while not explicitly telling it what to do."
"This was so good, I sent it to my sister. My sister who is not a programmer and has no knowledge of computer science in any way. But did play pokemon when she was younger. Very well done."
"Loved the video! Super interesting, engaging and informative. The way you presented it kept me engange when I had things to do lol."
wow
"bro basically just did a full PhD project right here, for fun..."
I&#39;ll remember you when the terminators take over and I&#39;d be kicking myself for not saying or doing anything. üòëüòë

"This made me think of how ants learn, communicate and adapt."
Smiths ai
"Very interesting video, i wonder how far can you take the ai through the game with as minimal intervention as possible. Can you have it learn to have a reasonably optimal team? to follow the main story &quot;like going back to pallet town at the beginning&quot;? Does it all depend on having as many iterations as possible for as long as possible until one makes a breakthrough? Surely not with more complex decisions, or maybe so, i dont know üòÖ"
This is presented in such an awesome and understandable way. Thank you. One for the algorithm!

"Should&#39;ve set a reward for being the very best, like no one ever was"
"How long did the entire project take? From installing and running the program, to writing the script and recording this video to completion?"
"Instead of emulating Red you could implement it, a version for animation and one for training, training would become just a visit in a matrix, while menus and combat would become a series of functions that act on the parameters of the world, you could do 10&#39;000&#39;000 actions per second instead of 8 like for walking(one every 24 frames, x20 the emulator, 60 fps), you need to study the game but I think the fandoms have already done most of the work, maybe you will lose all the original random aspects but I think this makes the AI less boring (my opinion), it seems really interesting maybe sooner or later I&#39;ll do it."
"Even I‚Äôm not a programmer, your video was really interesting! I can‚Äôt believe this is your first video üòÆ. Plzzzz make more this kind of AI learning videossss that visualized! Anyway, thanks for your interesting video ‚ù§ <br><br><br>From. Some korean‚Ä¶"
bro i wanted to see the AI doing the full thing
This was extremely well made. Great job [2]
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=9m31s"">9:31</a> Was that a real message? Blacking out while in the over world?"
Fascinating. You should do a whole channel on this concept applied to every game.
Definitively saving this one to listen to several times.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=11m40s"">11:40</a> obviously the AI is just trying to take advantage of Torrent"
"This was so well made that I enjoyed it more than I care to admit. That here&#39;s some minor breakdowns I&#39;ve noticed.<br><br>The parts that entertained me the most was how the AI decided with some sort of &quot;trauma mechanism&quot; that if the end result brought about more negatives than a reward that it would skip it altogether hence ending it&#39;s journey there rather than progressing, therefore concluding this is very similar to the mind of a child who first played this in their 5-7 years of age until a reward mechanism was introduced to further incentivize exploration.<br><br>This also proved that with the level logic introduced that a human, much like an AI was more inclined to focus on one Pokemon carrying them throughout the course of the game and ignore the rest regardless of stats, type counter or versatility. In later games IV and EV were introduced which helped determine which pokemon fared better than the rest, which was not so much present in the initial games making it challenging to introduce a logic on team building, but much like the squirtle bubble logic, if a logic was programmed to identify super effective moves then it would most likely start a decent team."
Amazing video! Thank you so much for making this! I&#39;m already excited for the next one.
"I cannot believe how great this is. I&#39;m so glad the algorithm found the video for me!! Plus, when the AI stopped to watch the flowers in Pallet üòÇ"
it&#39;s this vs Twitch Plays Pok√©mon
But why Squirtle?
There is so much quality in the realization of this video. You deserve to be known bro üòé
This was very entertaining and informative to watch how A.I. interprets things.
"Absolutely great job! I‚Äôm amazed by your ability to explain to a complete newbie like me, the steps and the problems involved in the development of this code. Great work! Indeed, this video gives me the motivation to start a real study in the machine learning area. I‚Äôve been flirting with this possibility for a couple of years, and this has made me understand the beauty of this concept. The next thing I‚Äôll do when I finish this comment is to start a 101 course. Thanks a lot."
Ok this was really cool. Thank you for your time
Super dope. I thought it was going to make it all the way to the Elite Four lol.
Came for Pokemon. Stayed for the existential crisis. Magnificently done! üòä
I‚Äôm only 11 minutes in but this is incredible scripting + voiceover delivery. How long did it take you to do both?
This was really well done. Who knew AI training and playing pokemon would be so interesting.
"You should be sponsored by a university or some learning platform, Im not into computer science but this makes me want to do things !! Great video, well explained, visualized and formated üéâüéâüéâüéâ"
I love how the ai refused to finish battles when it knew it would lose lmao

"If this is actually this guy&#39;s first video, then I am impressed. Great video regardless"
"I thought of some additional Rewards you could implement:<br>‚Ä¢ Using Super effective moves (ideally this will cause it to try different moves)<br>‚Ä¢ Using Status Conditions <br>‚Ä¢ Boosting its stats (looking for the text that said STAT raised, so that once it has maxed out a stat it stops trying to use it.)"
Pls do a video of the ai finishing the game.

Crazy how the AI traumatized itself like a real young child could with the pokemon center.
This is your first &quot;Hello World&quot; and it&#39;s crazy!<br>Loved it!
"This was so cool amazing video!, i feel like HMs will be the biggest barrier to ever getting a full playthrough via AI since they are situational and change whether or not an area is passable (they also both have to be found and require specific badges to use at all out of battle {meaning it may have already learned the wrong thing before it can use} and cant be deleted if that comes up, or at least not till very late game). I expect the first mandatory cut tree to be the biggest hurdle since it may never realize there is a tree there to cut in the first place much less figure out that obtaining and teaching cut is relevant (and cut is usually only mandatory a few times in a playthrough), but after that itll also have issues having the right pokemon for surf, strength etc at all times and realizing that a blocking area (pushable rock for strength, breakable rock for rocksmash, water for surf, tree for cut, etc) isnt actually a block with the correct hm use and the ability to use with badges will be likely impossible to recognize and achieve right as machine learning without adding special logic to see those as possibilities (it would need to learn to recognize terrain sprites probably? or in some way recognize situations that require cut etc to progress and also have the badge needed to do it)"
Dude i wasnt impressed like this for ever wtf
Make fun of my junk food all you want but wait until it evolves
"I wonder, what if you add &quot;Seen unique Pokemon&quot; to the list of rewarded actions? Would that force that AI the keep exploring even when the locations are too similar?"
"Now we need another AI that learns how to create the reward function for you haha<br><br>Out of curiosity, I&#39;d be interested in seeing what happens if you slowly take away points over time to encourage it to move through the game faster."
I use this video now to explain my friends and family to explain AI (at least a part). Many thanks to document this properly and thumbsup for  good audio too. We would all love to see more games/AI types :D
I was blown away by the presentation and story telling in this video üòä
Looks like a bachelor thesis.
It&#39;s like humans were programmed with intrinsic reward functions at a micro and macro level. Micro in our own hormonal system from birth to reinforce us to continue doing things that give us dopamine. On a macro scale in terms of humanity and natural selection. Individuals who survive and are successful in reproducing are the ones that pass on those behaviors and genes. Mutations are like the randomness that the AI constantly experiments with to see if anything new leads to increased rewards
this video is incredibly cool
This is SO. F***ING. COOL. Thank you so much for this work of art. Keep it up!
"Amazing, comment for algorithm"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=21m15s"">21:15</a> BREAKING NEWS! They figured out how to get models to do what you want. Money. That&#39;s how PH and OF are super popular :)"
Just waiting for Nintendo to shut this video down
Are there plans to have the Ai beat the game?
I&#39;m absolutely blown away by this. Great work!
One hell of a video! Keep up the good work!
How do you reward ai? Extra electronic current? Lol genuinely curious
Very impressive first video
Can you instruct it to do a Nuzlocke?
Bot bro in viridian forest seems to be shiny hunting (the one in the left) üíÄüòÇ
I think that may have been my favorite YouTube video of all time.
"Wait, that&#39;s the only video on the channel? Over 1mil views within a week? The video very well made, there are people who make a living on YouTube who are not up to this quality.<br><br>Keep going and you&#39;ll have a new full time job"
Put this in your resume.
Really good video
Interesting to use pokemon with AI
great video
I love how this is the only video this channel ever put out. Feel very Mic Drop
It would be more interesting if you gave AI the whole RAM as input and let it figure out itself what to do with it. Maybe it learns to modify the memory inside the game and cheat to the ending.
yea reaaaally great job :D i would have loved to see the team the AI came up with to defeat the elite 4  :D
It cost $1000 to make a robot play Pokemon?!! A fish in a bowl is probably cheaper!
"This is roughly what I imagine it‚Äôs like to watch a new mmo release from a devs perspective. Aside from dealing with bugs, server issues, etc."
This was an absolutely brilliant video. Would love to see more videos of AI learning other games or further refinement and developments with the AI and Pokemon Red. Bravo!
Cool vid but 2nd half of the video was so boring compared to the first. Just show us the AI catching an Abra or glitching or using a damn pokeflute on the snorlax or somthing.
I want to see if the AI can figure out Pok√©mon glitches like missing no and Mew.
"So the AI can now also play FireRed, or...?"
Thank you for informing us on this! Love the knowledge and result
"(A wild GEODUDE appeared!)<br>AI: Get in there Raichu, toast his rocky ass.<br><br>Developer: [shakes head in &#39;90s kid]"
Now this is a YouTube meal Video
how do you even zooomout the map
"What if you have two AIs, one deciding the next command, and another one predicting the next frame? Then the first has to surprise the second, and the second has to never be surprised."
"This is amazing, very well done."
using this technology could we make a pokemon game where the trainers level with you by being ais who had the same starting point as you just with different levels of learning rewards
"Very very very well done man, subscribed for sure. This is super high quality work and will look for more. I&#39;ll be also eager to help and learn if you ever need someone to confront with! Take care man :)"
"Awesome job, damn!"
"Deep and accurate about our human processes and traumas. Very entertaining, very well made. Thank you for the work."
"It would be interesting to see what would happen if you could pre-train based on recorded playthroughs of experienced human players, and then continuing automated training from that point.  You would probably get more human like movements, and predictable paths through areas, but fewer answers to strange random situations, at least without tons of training."
Really cool video. Great work. But can AI win Doom?
So it&#39;s all squirtle runs?
"I think the hamfisted &#39;deep&#39; comparisons to human behaviour are a bit much, but this is a fantastic video!"
Definitely want to see more of the technical stuff here.
+1 for the code man thanks cant wait to give this a try
"This is their first YouTube Upload, it‚Äôs crazy to me how much work, effort and money went into its production without having built an audience on an already successful channel before. Mad props to you Peter."
1M views on your first ever video in less than 7 days. That‚Äôs got to be some kind of record?
"Not sure how many hours you spent creating this video, this is just beautiful. Congrats üëèüëè"
"This is the type of AI I used to learn about in my compsci classes, and your explanations and breakdowns of how it works were excellent. If you aren&#39;t already considering it, you&#39;d probably make an excellent teacher or tutor"
Bro dropped on of the best videos on the platform as his first video
I‚Äôd love to see this applied to a game like BloodBorne. <br>1 point for every lantern lit<br>2 points for every successful dodge<br>3 points for every successful parry<br>4 points for every enemy beaten<br>5 points for every boss beaten
So when can we buy AI bath water?
"Commenting after the first Brock win. I think your rewards are too simple and static to play a game like Pokemon well, even with many iterations. I think tuning the reward towards the goals that align with what the game is about could help, and having them depend on the situation should also improve the system.<br>- for exploration, you are right on the number with &quot;new screens&quot;, but I wonder if a world coordinate system is available that rewards going to new x and y positions (as in getting near, not necessarily stepping on every single one)<br>- for fights, there should be multiple rewards. Losing little HP, gaining big amounts of XP in relations to your bar (to favour trainer and gym fights over lv2 ratatas), healing big amounts of HP. TO learn the move system, reward status effects on the enemy, own stat boosts, enemy stat decreases. Then also reward occurrences of very effective hits and punish not very effective and &quot;does nothing&quot;, and vice versa for the enemy movex<br>- for pokemon, reward level sum weighted toward more impactful rewards on the higher end of levels, or the AI will favour catching boat loads of weak ones. Also, reward expanding the pokedex with caught pokemon at least.<br><br>Weighted sensibly, of course. Not implying that this is easy."
"I&#39;m keen to see how the AI will tackle other gameplay features later on, teaching TM/HM moves, deleting moves to learn new ones, using HM&#39;s outside of battle eg surf &amp; fly, encountering ghosts before obtaining the silph scope, fishing with rods, cutting bushes, the hidden switches in Lt Surge bins, etc. Also items &amp; moves for escaping dungeons such as dig &amp; escape rope, whether it can identify low health &amp;/or power points &amp; determine a need to visit the poke centre before proceeding. I guess that would require a reward for maintaining money rather than just blacking out to save travel time.<br><br>Also the bit where you took control of the emulator, does this essentially let the AI watch what you did &amp; learn from that, or does it cease all AI interaction??"
I was 4 when i played pokemon yellow so i relate to this so much
AAAAAAAAAA<br>rrrrrrr<br>MVPs of the run
Chinese Pokemon IRL
"This channel only has 18K subs?! Keep up the great work dude. Amazing editing, great narrating, and good content! You&#39;re a natural!"
Beast
"Well articulated video, super cool. Ton of effort in this and it really shows, so I hope you are rewarded handsomely in the future"
I&#39;m more impressed how you visualised this
This is incredibly important work - thank you so much for undertaking it and sharing it so well!
"What makes you say that the total ROM data is 379KB? The US ROM I‚Äôve got is 1048576 bytes, default 7z.exe compresses it to 330884 bytes. The cart is obviously 1MB but idk how big the actual game is"
Very well made! congratz!
"Too many analogies with human behavior that don&#39;t make sense all the time. Great editing, though."
based on the names im pretty sure elon musk played the games
Wow it sent a scout through the forest like an ant colony.
This made me love AI again
"You‚Äôve got a hit here dude, I hope this is the start of a channel."
Ai: *presses start while walking towards a walker*...
Posts his first video<br>It¬¥s a fucking masterpiece<br>lmao what? great job my dude
please make more games like this its really fun to watch
That got pretty profound very fast
Every time I saw a Pokemon named AAAAAAAAA it made me laugh
Is possible to run this on android?
"You&#39;ve made your very first video in this channel 7 days ago and this video is so good<br><br>So do you plan to make content from now on? I think making a video about AI playing console games would be good and you&#39;ll tell us the progress<br><br>Also is the data gathered by the AI stored in itself or stuck at the game it played? Because if it&#39;s stored in the AI itself then it can use the experience it gained in its first game to the new game it&#39;ll play (assume that it has the same genre, RPG in this video&#39;s case)"
this is really cool
"I really want to see one of these that has a LLM component to the AI, so that it can read. Like, not even &quot;give it definitions&quot;, but the ability to process on screen text, recognize a word it has seen before, and then form it&#39;s own associations to that word based on actions and events that occur when it sees that word. (also, the ability to know hp states)  I imagine this could allow it to make associations like &quot;when [move x] is used on [opponent named y] it is [more/less] effective than on other opponents.&quot; I&#39;d also be interested to how that would make it react to location and people names."
"Great  comparison between AI and humans, especially playing Pok√©mon during the magikarp section"
Imagine acing Youtube&#39;s algorithm right of the bat with your first video. Impressive.
hiya i seem to have a broken pipoe error when trying to run the program
Bru blow up in a week with 1 video üòÆ
This video is top notch. So well made.... congratulations. Awesome job! It was incredible to watch.
"Amazing job, man! I have just a simple idea of what machine learning is, but I was able to learn a great deal with this video."
"Great content, keep it coming !"
Some People needs a new hobby.
looks like a multiverse lol
Bro made one (1) video and it s a fucking masterclass
impressive
"Thanks for being very meticulous in every aspect! Why not use some kind of vector database to allow the AI to store and retrieve latent-like memory in its own made up format? Maybe this will turbo charge it(allow it to plan, etc)."
beautiful. Pokemon Blue was my first game ever.
thats easily on the niveau of a scientific publication
Well done young man. This was a fascinating experiment
"This was well studied and explained. As someone planning to become a researcher and having graduated with a doctorate, this is the level of a research paper case study"
"It would also be interesting to see how differently the ai improves while a player screen is besides it that it can compare to, say after fighting a gym leader it checks progress of player or something like that"
Wow such an amazing video!
"not only is this video super interesting, it&#39;s visually very clear and well-made. Super cool to watch!"
what is this 200 iq video
"I love this video. Could you explain how the IA works or what type of IA is it, so we can implement it?"
&quot;Lose battle -1&quot; <b>Refuses to accept the loss</b><br><br>Real person fucks up and doesn&#39;t want to tell their parents because of how they react. <br><br>That&#39;s the vibe I got.
üêÄ AI gained 16 EXP. Points! üéâ
"This is higher quality than a lot of youtube&#39;s &quot;AI plays game&quot; which often turn out to be just some evolutionary approaches gobbled together that end up memorizing solutions with a tremendous amount of attempts.<br><br>The only criticism of the approach I have is that it doesn&#39;t have memory besides a few hardcoded values, it would be quite nice to see a transformer used here, even starting with something pretrained or an approach like Dreamer."
Oh awesome! And in a few years AI will play pokemon with humans and make us kill each other! Yay!
"This was extremely interesting! Personally, I want to see a full series of these videos! And actually want to see if it&#39;s possible to make an AI that can beat the entire game. And then see if what it learns can be applied in other pokemon games. Great job man!"
"Wow, I read somewhere that people tend to walk rooms counterclockwise because we subconsciously like to protect our hearts + most are right-handed, but it seems that there might be a deeper reason for it. I wonder if it&#39;s a 50-50 chance in the case of your Pokemon AI."
nerd
"I can see how much sweat went into making this video, subscribed!"
What a great video. I cant wait for part 2
"I&#39;m confused why you figured out &quot;it&#39;s a good stopping point&quot;. With proper adjustments reinforced learning algorithm should be able to go much further than that, possibly beat the whole game."
"I saw this video few days ago and it had like 50k view and now 1 million, glad to see something this good finally getting attention."
The AI and my 7 year old self have a lot in common. We both got lost in Mt Moon üòÇ
"Did it, if you did more training, ever actively understand strengths and weaknesses of the elements or just plainly learned &quot;if image = karpador -&gt; use thunderbolt&quot;?"
Watching all the playthroughs overlayed together and seeing all the different random movements at once makes me feel like I&#39;m staring at ants outside or something.
Hope to see more videos like this. Very interesting topic and amazing video.
The way you displayed the data and were able to discover emergent AI choices because of it is even more impressive than training the AI. Just from this alone I can tell you&#39;re wicked smart.<br><br>This is some nice work you did. You&#39;re gonna go far kid.
"i made another comment. hahaha<br><br>so... if you have time, comeplete the game until the elite 4 and the blue one. i hope the AI wins!"
Simply beautiful!
brilliant work! now do it on various of games like fire red or so. you can do it if you want! it will be fun nevertheless! <br><br>new channel can gain 1m views huh... well done! keep it up! you&#39;ll reach the peak!
This is incredible. This video could be used to explain AI learning in general
"Grate video!! <br>Is it possible to add rewards to the same thing we as players get rewards for?<br><br>Using more moves in a battle (might create strategy?)<br>Filling out your pokedex<br>Subtracting a point for each pokemon that runs out of live (encouraging strategy)<br>Not losing points for depositing pokemon. (This might ultimately over time as the number of pokemon increases, encourage the ai to swap out pokemon. Perhaps learning that strategy is best, remembering certain moves and pokemon were better might encourage the ai to swap out pokemon based off of memory?) <br>Can we teach the ai stats, pp, hp, evs, Ivs, and typing? If this is possible it would encourage longer Plays before healing up and more entertaining battles, creating more memorable moments. <br><br>Really good stuff. I&#39;m dying to see more"
Nintendo even got the robots catching them all üòÇ
Why does the AI just stop at various points?
Superb!!!!!
So Oak&#39;s Parcel is basically anti-AI DRM :D
Neat
Bravo!!!!! üëèüëèüèªüëèüèºüëèüèΩüëèüèæüëèüèø
The fact that the 8-Bit Pokemon music never stopped playing in the background made this video a 11/10 watch when it would have been a 10/10.
"Once in a while there comes a video that reminds you of why YouTube is such an amazing platform! Thank you for this video I thoroughly enjoyed it,. Honestly this has got to be the quickest that I have ever subscribed to a channel!"
That&#39;s fantastic stuff and it even got a use case: Rom hacks. This can be used to simulate playthroughs and find bugs when tuned even further.
Amazing stuff :O
This was gorgeous to watch from start to finish.~
Cool
Wait so is the AI like actually in the game or playing like we would... like does it&#39;s eyes see the world as the game???
One of the best made videos on YouTube!
Hello can you make some tutorial how to make AI like this? I&#39;m very interested but I don&#39;t know how to start
did your fucking debut just get 1 milli views? you‚Äôre well on your way. stellar narration and editing. this video deserved its numbers. excited to see more from you
Neuro gonna get this
he amount of effort you put in this video is tremendous. Would love to see future videos!
"Don‚Äôt really care about AI this just made me wanna pick up fire red, liquid crystal, and emerald again."
Video of the year no doubt
Wow! The best RL video I have ever watched
"Great video, very interesting - make more pls :-)"
"jaw dropping quality video, very well done!"
"Couldnt you make attacking with not effective attacks subtract a point, and attacking with super effective attacks gain one point, so that the AI would pass brock faster?"
The effort putting into making this is massive. Well done.
"Super interesting. Well done with the presentation, editing, and themes."
I wonder why the AI didn&#39;t decide to grind for a ridiculous amount of time to level up
pIz make a part 2!!!!!!
It is 2:28 am and i am wide awake. Here i am. I need help. üòÇ
I would love to see the ai do a full play though
Man I can already see him getting jobs from the big tech guys üòä
"Wish it was longer, like way longer."
I wanted it to become Pok√©mon master :(
So twitch play pokemon VS AI learning; who wins?
Looks good!! wow!! <br><br><br><br><br><br>Take a shower now :)
"you could allow the AI to remember tiles it went through with a limited range, allowing it to try and not get stuck in multi-screen wide corridors"
"you could have based all your rewards around the game&#39;s internal currency, which would have allowed it to try buying pokeballs/potions, and maybe skip buying the magikarp"
"Love the time and energy that was put into this. Appreciate the explanation of when you realised you had to adjust the heuristics and start again, this video is written like a formal scientific paper but very accessible and more entertaining. But most of all, it&#39;s great that you went to the effort of including detailed instructions on how to reproduce at home! Excellent work all round."
"Great first video, a follow-up video will be great"
"regarding the AI being distracted by animations, you could have probably made it &quot;view&quot;&#39; raw tile indices instead, making it focus on the general meaning of a tile instead of its blingy appearance"
One of the most well produced videos I‚Äôve ever seen on YouTube. How you only have 17K subs is crazy. <br>Wishing you all the success!
Might try this one day on the game final fantasy tactics. Would be interesting to see how it would complete the game as there are a lot of builds like in Pok√©mon to choose from
a lot more believable than foxmaster&#39;s bullshit
Feels like shibata kun
Everyone gangsta until AI finds out what missingno is.
I enjoyed your content and video so much. Great work.
looking forward to future videos
God do I hate AI
Do Each generation next! I wanna see it evolve
"Training an AI can be frustrating, expensive and time consuming. But it gives some interesting insights, one wouldn&#39;t have gotten otherwise. Thanks for sharing!"
DO NOT STOP
At least I&#39;m not the only one getting lost in Mount moon
"Good video, I really enjoyed how visually well explained this was."
Man this rocks! Hoping for another Pokemon video from you! Subscribed.
Best video I have seen on AI and Pokemon combined
"Wanted to try this, but couldn&#39;t get it working. i followed all your steps but the commands didn&#39;t work. I think the problem I have is with getting the pip, installation working (Not that the other promts worked for me in python either)."
Maybe someday our game enemies won‚Äôt be dumb potatos
ok now make it finish the game
Could you try to get AI to play it through? It would be interesting to see what AI finds to be the most optimal way to play it.
Its totally mind blowing how It&#39;s ur first video and you got a million views within just 7 days. It&#39;s totally deserved. Subscribed and waiting for more content. Best of luck man
Humans aren&#39;t all that different from AI. In the beginning we make better logical leaps because of our larger knowledge base but eventually AI will catch up. So we better start considering the rights of some possibly sentient beings we might accidental create. If we don&#39;t die to climate change first.
These are the moments where I notice how great youtube can be. Just stumbled randomly across this video and was completely amazed. Just imagine where AI will go in just 10 years from now!<br>Awesome video! Thanks for that!
Well i dont know anything so thank you i wont use this info but someone will all i have is a phone i remember back in the day id do the graphics for mmorpg using byond was cool never got into the coding side of it was so complicated
&quot;What Training AI to Play Pokemon with Reinforcement Learning can teach about ourself&quot;
"This reminds me of &quot;Can you beat pokemon FireRed while blind and deaf?&quot; Amazing youtube video, highly suggest you watch that if you enjoyed this."
"came to see AI, got a dose op philosophy instead.<br>Great video :)"
You could use a coordinate system instead of rely on images for the exploration
The amount of pidgeys and rattatas that got slaughtered by this ai üòµ‚Äçüí´
What&#39;s the correlation between an evolved magikarp to a gyarados for junk food?
Truly an S tier video. I am flabbergasted. such a beautiful concept. Keep it up! I hope we get to see more such AI playing games videos
"Wish you went on longer, was fun to watch the AI go about. :D"
Wow pretty neato
"well done, this was hella interesting, i wonder if giving the database of pokemon and their info would help the AI to get better"
"One interesting difference between an ai playing and us playing, is that the ai doesn&#39;t read.<br><br>We constantly read what the npcs say and they guide us through the game, significantly cutring our learning time. They teach is the goal is to catch all pokemon an dbeat the elite 4. They teach us to catch pokemon, they teach us about type advantages etc.<br><br>And they things they don&#39;t teach us, we teach each other (stab bonus ev,iv,the entire databases online).<br><br>Idk how you would add this kind of learning, but it shows the difference between a kid (pretrained ai with reading skill) and an ai learning how to play the game."
this is so cool!
Beat the game! an amazing video for sure. So amazing that I want to see if we can do this all the way :)
Sick video. Well done.
Please stop this is scary üò≠
I love these data science driven pokemon projects ! Very well done and entertaining ! Also ..... kinda scary what AI can do in the future D:
So it almostt played as much pokemon red as me
"i feel like to make it actually play the game you‚Äôd have to make flags for gyms  completing and reward big for talking and battling new npcs, and reward for winning trainer battle a lot of stuff, backtracking is a big problem tho that‚Äôll be hard at"
"speechless, absolutely phenomenal work. Can&#39;t wait to see your next project"
:(
"this video is mindblowing. I have absolutely no clue how you collected and translated all this data into such cool visualizations, but i am in awe. this is so cool. thank you so much for making it!"
"I wonder if you could train a reward handlinf IA to be &quot;amused&quot; or &quot;bored&quot; and give feedback rewards based on less game-specific element like sound design, color palette, overcoming hardship and repetitiveness."
I really loved this.
So thats how Naruto learned the Rasenshuriken. :D
can you teach AI how to teach you how to sex with AI
&quot;Well endowed servers&quot; had me rolling üòÇ
"I may or may not have been eating a bag of Doritos while watching at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=14m25s"">14:25</a>."
These dummy won&#39;t be remembered They Are the enemy of THE MOST HIGH People.<br>ally of ai = ally of the demons teaching something Pointless = Shell of ManKind you&#39;re Useless To THE MOST HIGH therefore Repent or get lost like the rest of y&#39;all
Wonderful. Did the AI find a new way/glitch to catch mew? :D
"Congrats on 1M views! üéâ  I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;re processing your essentially overnight success on YT, but just know the quality of this video speaks for itself and you absolutely earned and deserved it."
It&#39;s like watching somebody train a robot to be a speed runner.
imagine how ai can conquer the worldüòÜ
"I really like how you outline the parallels between machine learning and human logic. I&#39;m currently writing a research paper about AI and its role in society and industry. While doing my research, I&#39;ve learned a lot (probably more than I wanted to) about the similarities between biological and neurological functions in humans, and generative AI/training in machines. Thank you for making this video, I&#39;ve learned a lot."
This is incredibly fascinating. Thank you for this.
Youre a madman. How tf? I would watch a &quot;HOW I MADE THIS VIDEO&quot; video haha
"Great project! The behavior analysis and visualization are impressing. RL in pokemon was always interesting for me, but the complexity always put me off. Thanks also for the technical part. Have you thought of dividing the gameplay into different models? like one for map movement and one for battles? Would have been my first approach..."
The visualizations in this video were incredible.
I find this is one of the best examples of reinforcement learning. Especially on how AI would cut corners or fail on unexpected scenarios
This video was incredible I love it
Yeah I think it took me 100x to beat Brock too. üòÇ
ü§Ø
When you finally beat the supermeatboy level
This is the smartest video I‚Äôve seen in ages. Thank you.
No offense but i found this vid worth watching just because of the nostalgia haha. Everything else was just a bonus! Excellent work man!
"Erie how it reminds me of twitch plays Pok√©mon, like we are the AI"
What was the most common starter for all the AI&#39;s?
Holy crap this is your very first YT video? I can&#39;t wait to see what you cook up if you continue to create! Outstanding work!
&quot;after 300 hours it beat Brock&quot;<br><br>Bro you made an artificial Game Grumps
We need it to beat the game
This is an amazing video and I love these types of machine learning. But the parts where it‚Äôs just a bunch of Red‚Äôs running around the screen will never not be funny.
"So very interesting, thank you and we look forward to seeing more. I loved all the layers to this, and I have to say I can‚Äôt wait to see how the AI learns to beat the game and what team it deems optimal. So far it sounds like it agrees with 7 year old me when I got the game and focused only on Blastoise and Pidgeot ;)"
"AI Misalignement counter, go:"
√ë
This was greatness. Kudos! ü§åüèΩ
this was basically how I played as a small child
"Came for a fun Pok√©mon video, left with a deeper understanding of my existence as a human being üò≠"
Just a random aside but your comment on algorithms mimicking the human experience. What do you think &quot;god created you in his image.&quot; &quot;We worked in the garden of eden and were cast out for the crime of theft.&quot; The Bible literally says we are biological androids built to serve other beings.
"It would probably take a tok of time but it would be very interesting to see one of these capable of beating thr game, and then use that same one and insert it into a different pokemon game to see how well it does with its prior knowledge but new area."
I‚Äôm honestly scared of ai
I would genuinely like to see this AI play something like fatal frame or obscure on ps2 üòÇ
"AI activists: AI is the biggest threat to mankind. We need  a pause, legislation, and committies asap<br><br>The AI:"
This video adds more weight to that we may be living in a simulation.
This is amazing
Why does this feel like an A+ school project
You made a speed run optomization program. You can apply this to any game and optomize speed runs. That&#39;s money right there.
"Great video! My own PPO training benefitted from scaling stepwise rewards to be between -1 and 1, I wonder if you experimented with similar scaling?"
Bro honestly this is YouTube video of the year. How spectacularly you presented this information in such a clear and entertaining way that is honestly on the level of professional science productions like Cosmos. Absolutely colossal performance man. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you had an entire production team.
It&#39;s the comparison between Magikarp and junk food for me
40 seconds in and I am already extremely impressed. That editing is crazy
Red getting traumatized by the Pokemon Center and ending up isolating himself at Mt.Silver is hillarious yet sad at the same time.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=5m08s"">5:08</a> this is actually no different than my 4 year old niece. Even this level of learning it‚Äôs crazy to me."
Good video
It‚Äôs pretty cool that effectively this AI model has mapped out every single possible move or at least the majority of them.
"I feel like you spent more time making your visualizations than you did planning out how you should reward the AI, haha. I don&#39;t mean that as an insult, though. Almost every video like this I&#39;ve watched so far runs into the same issue of the AI finding some way to abuse the parameters you initially set. Usually it ends up with adding more things that give or take rewards, which makes me wonder why people don&#39;t plan ahead and add extra checks from the beginning. Also the idea of paying out the wazoo for servers, but I guess not everybody has a gaming PC and a lot of time on their hands!"
"First is twitchplayspokemon, now is aiplayspokemon. Its funny how similar the &#39;randomness&#39; of mass human mob with ai trying to clear the game."
I hit a blinker 30 min ago this is too much for me right now
Your analogies to humans are the real reward here ‚ù§
Looks like Squirtle was a learned behavior for Brock.  Sounds like someone I know
My Roomba could learn a thing or two.
This is such a cool video
This is the most fascinating thing I‚Äôve seen in a LONG time. Please do a follow-up where we see it best and ultimate tear the whole game apart!<br><br>Ohhh! Or Castlevania SOTN! Please!
I do not want to download and run this program myself
If pokemon was an MMO Rpg that&#39;s how the game would start and also the servers will shutdown due to overload.
This is like such a classic example of how AI thinks differently from humans. It can&#39;t figure out how to get past a ledge but its pattern recognition is so strong that it figured out friggin RnG manipulation by itself.
"Well I have a Dell server with two Xeon 12core 24 threads each, 384GB of RAM, and RTX 3060... Going to be running this for a long while now."
Ai is doing the shadow clone jutsu training method.
An amazing content! Very well made!
can you use fire red?
Great vid. Very interesting. Keep up the good work!
"So nurturing of your creation, the way you talk about it - superimposing human behavior and working to guide this thing in line with us. Strange time to be alive"
Incredibly well done!!!
kudos for going in detail on the technical parts
"Geez this is your first video? Extremely well done, video flow, speaking, technical work, human insights, all so interesting!!! Will you be posting more?"
"Still mid video but does the model ever learn that it should go back and heal at the Pok√©mon center when it‚Äôs about to get wiped out to avoid losing $? Currently the idea of novelty makes it so that it will be biased towards going forward, would love to see the reward be changed to a function combining novelty and Pok√©mon hp to see if the model can learn that it needs high hp to be able to travel safely instead of just running it down till it gets a big level advantage"
Fantastic first video! Subscribed and looking forward to your next video üéâ
Omg do Mario next
Awesome work ü•∞
Incredible video. Looking forward to going through your repo
"It would be great to set the goals as intended in the game storyline. 1) Catch/scan as many pokemons as possible, you can add a reward for that 2) win as many badges as possible by setting a reward for each badge that is won. <br>I&#39;m very curious to see how it does with higher level puzzles like waking up snorlax or giving tea to the guards."
First it‚Äôs the guy who comes out of nowhere posting a specific string of inputs that will beat Pok√©mon everytime posting a masterpiece then leaving now it‚Äôs this
"Fascinating. I wonder if an agent with more meaningful memory (perhaps party composition/state, quest flags, overworld position, and a list of chunks visited encoded into its input?) would be able to make more contextual choices as the game went on."
Nice video. Keep ‚Äòem coming
Much better than when Twitch played Pokemon. Lol  you will always be a legend Bird Jesus
Great video!!!
You nailed the music. GJ on the vid and data
Oh this is gonna blow up
Great video!
Where are your other videos? I need more of this awesome content!
This is a masterpiece ‚ù§‚ù§
"Hmm, if I were to run this on my own, I think I&#39;d add a reward for using a super effective attack, a minor penalty for not very effective attacks, a minor penalty that applies after spending longer than X minutes with similar map topography, a major reward for adding a Pokemon to the pokedex, a major reward for earning a badge, and a minor reward for its Pokemon being a higher level than an opponent. It would be interesting to see if it could learn to &#39;grind&#39; levels if it knows its going to face a higher level gym.<br><br>I&#39;d love to play around with this myself, but it looks like 32GB of RAM wouldn&#39;t be enough to make meaningful progress in any reasonable length of time."
"If I had a nickel for every time I have found a youtube channel with only a single, amazing, and in depth video talking about something cool they did in Pok√©mon that I never would have thought was possible before watching, I would have two nickels.<br><br><br>For the record those two nickels would be this video, and MartSnacks ‚Äúfire red while blind and deaf‚Äù."
Incredible work
Awesome video. Thanks. Yes humans are basically extremely complicated reward based organisms.
When humans play this game we know that we need to go from gym to gym to gym. Maybe there could be a function that rewards the AI for approaching gym leaders/elite 4?
U gotta make more videos... this stuff is awesome
<i>Pok√©mon centers? I&#39;ve been there once... they stole my pidgey. I&#39;m never going there again! Awful service!</i>
i dont understand rewarding<br>what can you give to an ai as a reward and does it have motivation???/ adfkjlhgasklhjfghjaskd
"Geez, I can‚Äôt even imagine how many hours it took getting the rewards setup this well. I‚Äôm pretty new to AI stuff, but I‚Äôve recently started playing with some super, SUPER simple PPO, and even for incredibly simple tasks getting the rewards right is very difficult.<br><br>The slightest tweak can completely shoot the AI off in the strangest directions and you‚Äôre left scratching your head wondering why it‚Äôs done that. It‚Äôs a real balancing act of giving it direction, but not stifling it by over rewarding or punishing it so much it always/never does that thing."
"Bro has done one video so far and it&#39;s a banger, keep it up!"
"Now can you make the same AI play other pok√©mon games, other games and see what it can do?"
This is truly amazing and has the potential to make perfect speedruns due to the amount of times it could be run. I wish it didn&#39;t cost so much to run so that you could put it through the whole entire game!
Awesome video
THE LEDGE
The Big Filter!
How can I get ahold of you? I also make content (partnered on twitch) I have been searching for someone like you
I NEED TO LEARN HOW TO DO THIS.
This was extremely well made. Great job
I wonder how this would go with a game like Ruby Sapphire and Emerald
we do exactly this in our heads before pressing a button
One of the best videos I‚Äôve seen on YouTube üéâ
I really like the production value and the editing and this video has a great data visualisation. I really liked it. Good job. Keep it up ‚ù§
this is dope - isnt storing every screen throughout a game very memory and computation intensive? how did you get around this? thanks n
Perfection.
This is his FIRST video omg. Way to start with a bang
Would love to see this go all the way. I am curious to see what it&#39;s final team would look like
This video makes me think of bacteria.
"Went to your channel to find more videos to watch, was disappointed there were none..."
Looking like ants crawling from an ant nest
Running this on a public cloud sounds expensive and painful af
"This is incredible, great work and thank you for sharing"
"Poor AI, getting traumatized by suddenly losing its pokemon for a reason it doesn&#39;t understand"
"nice job , i like this"
AI: &quot;I like the way these flowers blow in the breeze&quot; human: &quot;lemme patch that&quot; Ai: &quot;I have depression now!&quot;
Both incredible RL experiment and video editing! Subscribed for future content like this
"This was invaluable, thanks for putting this together! &lt;3"
can you teach it to do the mew glitch or to softreset for shiny pokemon?
I emphasized with the AI so much when it was scared of the pokemon center after losing one of its‚Äô pokemon to the PC
"I&#39;m confused how the debugger the AI seems to have a visualization of the screen, yet it didn&#39;t &#39;learn&#39; how to stop getting stuck at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=17m38s"">17:38</a> - if it knows the sprites/pixels shouldn&#39;t it easily learn that those barriers can only be navigated downwards and not upwards?"
Please please please continue the series hahaha this is awesome üôåüî•
I played blue version before I could read. After a year of playing I beat it and I could read. I was 6-7.
Is it possible to extract some algorithm based on the RL&#39;s results?
I need to see the AI beat the game bro you just drop new addictive substances like this willy nilly bro
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=29m00s"">29:00</a> you misspelled Environment hahaha no big deal tho"
"So cool man, great job üòäüëèüíØ"
"As an OG Pokemon fan with fond memories of this game, this was so interesting to see. The scenery enjoyment was wholesome. lol<br><br>I&#39;m a physics major who wants to learn how to make my own AI as a lab assistant that I can talk to. Its not covered in my physics track so I&#39;m on my own, at least for the next two years. If anyone reading this comment has some good resources to learn how I might do this, let me know."
I need to see how end game looks like on average üòÇ
"The more I learn about programming, the more I think &quot;man I&#39;m glad I never got into it, this looks so tedious.&quot;"
Can‚Äôt believe iteration 100 was the first to beat Brock
"Is there a way to do the machine learning that is referencing other iterations in the current agent? For example comparing rewards to see what actually was working better. After so many frames, compare reward values and then try to bring up the lower value. Something like that could pull out all the trainers derping in route 22, which completely nullifies that instance&#39;s contribution to the overall agent. And then, that reduces the overall efficiency of the machine learning."
"Congratulations, what a fun and mindblowing project and video! This is an excellent way of introducing reinforcement learning (machine learning too) and motivating students to pursue cool projects."
It looks like pokemon was taken over by Morties
Thank you!
"This is an incredibly well designed and presented video. Really interesting content. I can&#39;t imagine the time/effort/resources/etc it would take for you to see this through for completing the game, but that would be awesome!"
This video is fascinating and the visuals are such a treat
This video is very cool. Can you do Nintendo original Zelda?
And this AI is still faster than me a beating this game üòÇ
This is really awesome! I hope to see more from you!
"Dude, this whole thing is like a research paper. Stellar work of presentation and synopsis of everything that was observable and noteworthy. Also you kept in the scientific method to show your work and a way for anyone else who could take this experiment to get the results you are seeing. Kudos!"
AI vs. Twitch plays Pok√©mon?? Someone get on that
"I don‚Äôt know why, but this made me laugh so hard I started crying. It reminded me of watching my little sister trying to play Pok√©mon when she was 3 years old."
The visualization and structure of this video are really enjoyable.
"I don&#39;t know why, this really reminds me of tweaking the Ragnarok Online Bot I used to play as a kid...."
"Only partway through the video so I&#39;ll edit this if it turns out you already thought of this, but granting a bonus for obtaining gym badges seems like a good way to encourage actual game progression. Alternatively, a bonus based on the &quot;caught pokemon&quot; number in the pokedex seems like a good way to motivate it into the &quot;catch &#39;em all&quot; style of gameplay.<br><br>Turning the former into a multiplier on all future points earned in fact would be a real good way to encourage it trying to earn badges as fast as possible.<br><br>EDIT: Yeah, looks like badges are a property you showed, so I guess maybe it would be a big improvement to make badges multiply all points earned after acquiring it to motivate the AI to progress the game faster."
Amazing! Can&#39;t wait for Part 2
Awesome video! I know a lot of work went into this.
What a project - Absolutely amazing on all counts! You could do this for a living - Keep at it!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=6m56s"">6:56</a> So this AI just automatically knew to go left in viridian forest and didn&#39;t even try at first to go any other way? Doesn&#39;t seem sus at all...."
"In the starting square the AI can only move by walking left or down, could this have anything to do with it moving counter clockwise when encountering an obstacle? it falls back on its first steps."
Whoa! I&#39;m quite surprised that this is your first video. Good job.
This could be used in a peer reviewed study.
Love the video hope it becomes a series. Would it be possible to give it -1 for running into the same wall multiple times so it doesnt spend so much time wandering?
Pokemon 99. Don&#39;t give Nintendo ideas xD
"I watched every minute of this. So cool! You did such a great job explaining the concepts, sharing the hang-ups and how they also apply to us mortal humans, and also the editing was perfect. I&#39;m very much looking forward to keeping up with your work and watching any future projects you decide to share with us. Great job!!! üôåüôåüôå"
"Is this absolutely awesome video really your first one on the channel? I hope there&#39;s more to come because I find this stuff endlessly fascinating.<br><br>The quality is excellent, and sits right near the level of quality of Retro Game Mechanics Explained."
Simply amazing!
can we get it to shiny hunt?
I&#39;m currently in college and taking a course about machine learning. This is extremely neat to watch and I may focus my final project on it and your research.
This is really cool and informative way to talk about AI. I love this if you can make more content please do. Thank you for the content.
"So cool! Great job Peter, love watching these types of videos :)"
This was an incredibly fun and interesting watch.  Also the editing is so slick
"Getting stuck on ledges, now who does that remind me of?"
I&#39;m only 1 minute in and I&#39;m more impressed by the editing and how there&#39;s so many instances of the game in one frame of this video.
Would love to see adversarial AI used to develop more challenging trainers/gym leaders for a ROMhack. But that‚Äôs speaking as someone who has no idea about the resulting file sizes compared to the standard AIs.
thats amazing
This is some serious editing skills !
Whos training who though? Is the reinforcement model rewarding US when our code finally runs as a reward or are WE training it haha üòÇ
I hope you‚Äôre willing to produce more content..This was amazingly digestible for someone with zero background knowledge
"Just commenting for the YouTube  AI algorithm get the reward necessary to get more people to watch this, this video is a masterpiece"
"This is so next level, and it&#39;s your first video?!"
The quality of this video is superb.
Very cool video. Melts my brain
Subbed üëç<br>I&#39;ll wait for the next vid
This guy clearly didnt have a KJV bible in his home...
The quality here is so incredible. Such an amazing video Peter!!
This is AMAZING!! Please continue with this. Maybe optimize a pokemon run in the long end
This is incredible.  Well done
Such an interesting video. Please make more Pok√©mon Ai. If you could master the ai run you could have it stream on twitch. Subscribed
One step closer towards defeating Skynet üòé
You are a genious!
isnt that how they made smogon
Reminds me of ants
Very impressive. Great work!
"AI can play chess like Fisher and Kasparov but still in a learning process to play Pokemon. Who knows, likely in the future, Nintendo buy AIs and get them to play their games 24/7 battling against other plays in the server."
Wait a second!! I just looked and is this really your first video?! And it&#39;s blowing up?! Damn! Congrats dude!
when it did a little jig after beating its first trainer battle.. i felt that
"i had an idea for getting the ai to back track to deliver the parcel at the very begging of the game. If you add a very minimal reward for revisiting npcs when you get a certain distance away from said npc, it would make the ai backtrack because it has no other way to gain reward at the start of the game. The reward would have to be very small and much less than the reward for exploring, and there would halve to be a reward for visiting the npc in the first place, but it should make the ai back track"
This thing is beautiful
I love how small changes made some huge differences. I think my favorite was anytime the best reward was to not play. It&#39;s like rage quitting and saying I won&#39;t ever play again lol
What Emulator did you use?
Some of the comparisons given between your Pok√©mon AI and human behavior seem like quite a stretch.
Your editing is top notch.
yo this was an amazing video. i hope you make more!
they still played better than me üíÄüíÄüíÄ
"Awesome video, subbed! Let&#39;s get this Ai to finish red version ‚ù§"
Thanks for opensourcing the code unlike most YouTubers. Now I can ACTUALLY PROVE its AI.
Is this what the multiverse looks like??
A company like skynet won&#39;t be responsible for our machine overlords. We will do it ourselves. <br><br>Great video tho
"I feel like adding in the parameter of &quot;Battles won&quot; would be a very easy way to encourage the AI to complete the game as that is the overall core focus of pokemon is to beat everyone. Also, having &quot;unique pokemon&quot; would be the other major driver for the AI."
"Amazing video, thanks alot!"
"We‚Äôve got to get the AI to win the Pok√©mon league!!! As a robotics major, I will cry the day that happens!! üò≠üò≠üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"man, very nicely edited."
Dude its AI playing pokemon you dont need to get Philosophical
Can you do this in gold?
"‚ÄúOver all of the games, it buys a total of over 10,000 Magikarps‚Äù<br><br>I feel personally attacked."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=14m37s"">14:37</a> Yeah, but the problem is, junk food can‚Äôt evolve into a Gyarados"
When does Point Crow start racing AI in pokemon
Wowwwww!!! Probably the best video I watched this year üòçüòçüòç
"Your intervention point on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=31m31s"">31:31</a> blew my mind open on why I wonder I do silly things, and then I understand it&#39;s probably some Higher Force showing me things I don&#39;t see yet."
Thanks for all the work put into that video to show the progress and explain how the AI learned. That was SO interesting to watch! :)
one thing i was curious about was how did the ai figured out to not constantly pressing on the attack move that had 0 pp left and that took well over 20 training iterations before something changed. was the change done manually or by the ai itself?
Was this for a dissertation? This thing was a full presentation and explanation on AI playing pokemon üòÆ Curiosity really is the best teacher I guess üòÇ
"I mean, gyarados is pretty good, so it&#39;s an unwitting investment if it valued evolution too"
ew why
A.I. has always played Pok√©mon though. Who do we think has been controlling the gym leaders all this time? üòÇ
algo
"This is amazing, but I&#39;m a bit sad we didn&#39;t get to follow the ai through the whole game."
Part 2 when?
"Dude, you should write a paper and publish your work in a scientific conference. Not sure how much similar work is done, but your approach and challenges are strong."
can it be done on other games <br>lol
"Halfway through and I‚Äôm super curious how adding some real time based reward would help the AI, if it was further rewarded for accomplishing objectives quickly and efficiently"
"i would love something like this for Final Fantasy I on NES, or a platformer like Shovel Knight."
First video? This is an amazing start!  Presentation and script was extremely well presented.  I hope to see more in the future.
Great video!
"I always buy Magikarp from that guy, and train it to Gyarados before I met Misty."
I like the magickarp and mcdonalds food comparison equivalent. I wonder what would be the equivalent of Gyarados evolutioƒ±n in fastfood menu haha
"Did you try the REAL objective? &quot;Have pokemons with differents types of moves and get them stronger&quot; But the IA should know at least the name of the pokemons and moves, also the best options of moves for each enemy"
We learnt that everyone can progress in life if they have the right reward.
Thanks this has given me something fun to try.  I own pokemonred and made my own ROM just for this.  I have no idea what im doing AT ALL so here goes!
Not even ai is safe from route 22 ledge
"Wow, this could have been such a boring video, but you made me watch the entire 30 minutes with this beautiful edit."
This is super interesting. Congrats for the video!
The AI doing RNG manipulation was really cool
thats amazing and scarry at the same time.
"absolutely fabulous, good science"
"This is amazing work! I have been trying to learn and find a practical example at a small scale of reinforced learning that is simple, what you did here meets just that! This video is quite the gem and you went above and beyond of what I expected! I can&#39;t wait to see more of your content. I appreciate you sharing your code and showing how to re-run the simulation and the machine learning for those that are interested in learning."
"The technical part was very understandable, although I&#39;m a data scientist student, I think most people will understand it. Also because people that are interested in these topics tend to click faster on these type of videos and already have some background on coding or ML."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=17m18s"">17:18</a> following an edge was my strategy while search caves or vaults in Elder Scrolls or Fall Out."
This is how you start a youtube channel.
"This is an incredible video! You broke it down so eloquently that even with little programming/comp science knowledge, I felt like I understood everything happening.  The diagrams, demonstrations, etc were so well put together and I can&#39;t wait to see what else is to come on your channel!"
"I‚Äôm absolutely impressed like several others at how well this was put together, your production value and how entertaining it was though my teenage son got a bit lost near the last quarter of the video due to adhd. <br><br>Subscribed immediately, can‚Äôt wait to see what else you do."
What did you do to show all of the iterations being played at the same time?
"This was outstanding as a YouTube video in general, but inconceivable as a channel&#39;s first one! I especially appreciated how you showed us how we could run the program ourselves"
This is a great vid
This is so insanely well done and presented!
This is the most interesting thing i&#39;ve watched on Youtube recently... Amazing work.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m05s"">4:05</a> &quot;Curiosity leads us to our most important discoveries, but at the same time it makes us vulnerable to distractions and gets us into trouble&quot;.<br><br>What a wonderful and accurate and relatable  quote."
A simple Thank You!
I‚Äôve watched the first 10 minutes by accident. It‚Äôs so enthralling. Can‚Äôt wait to come back and watch this with my lunch.
"When I have extra money, I absolutely buy that scammers Magicarp"
Amazing work! Also I love the Big 16 grilled cheese. IFYKYK
"I searched for this exact video a couple of weeks back to sadly not find a decent one, ever so glad I searched again and came across yours!<br><br>Thank you for this exciting 33minutes! And especially for releasing it for all to run<br><br>I understand these vids take a while, but please make more of these! üòÅ<br>Also, can&#39;t believe this is your first vid! Brilliantly made!"
"If you can somehow include glitches or if the AI can find and remember them itself, this could set best possible speed run times to compete with."
"Such a great video! I&#39;d love to hear more about the neural network, how were the inputs handled? How many layers and neurons were used? Did you measure increased performance as you increased neurons?"
so lets say you bring the AI to the second gym it wil lstart learning new stuff no ?
"Amazing video, thanks! I have a question: You said that you attribute exploration awards based on the screen the AI sees. Later, in the technical part, you say that you the coordinates are stored by the game. Why not attribute exploration awards based on the game discovering new coordinates?"
"EXTREMELY fascinating, very cool, thanks for sharing"
Homie please let the ai beat the game üò≠ or do a couple gyms at a time till it beats the game! You would get so many views
Pok√©mon diamond was my first game and it took me a week before I realised I could walk out the house. AI is very relatable indeed
This video was incredible!
This algorithm is something I see everywhere. It seems to be the same in our brain and many other things
"I watched the video, subbed right away, liked the video, went on your profile to view more - <b>whaaat?? First video??</b> Wow. Looking forward to lots more content!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=10m21s"">10:21</a> I think that the increasing amount of HP of the Pokemon had to give rewards, I think it could trigger using potions and leveling up, not only using PokeCenter. Also losing HP could subtract score, and it might build some strategies how to avoid losing HP but gain more ü§î"
Bro spend 1k lol
Can&#39;t express how amazing this whole project is. Well done mate !!
Very insightful discussion. Very funüéâ‚ù§
5 years?!?! my gosh also the content is amazing.
My guys first ever video banged this hard. This video was the perfect balance of future and past.
"This is amazing, especially for a first video. I look forward to your future content. üëç"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=3m40s"">3:40</a> what if the Ai tought he was playing with other Ai?"
The similarity to this and twitch plays Pok√©mon is alarming

So basically you simulated me as a 5 year old
"Fantastic video sir. I can&#39;t believe this is your first ever content! As a lifelong python user and full-time automation data engineer, and a child of the &#39;80s who played these games in high school, this was an incredible video. Thank you so much for sharing this. I am definitely going to go play around with this later"
This poses a question: are humans just God&#39;s &quot;AI&quot; modeled after God&#39;s image? The word God can interchangeably be synonymous with an intelligent higher power
"The fact that you made an amazing quality video to share and explain your project and also shared your source code, I instantly subbed. Thank you!"
"lots of odd decisions in how you implemented, could also have done without the speculation and musings about humans and humanizing the AI/alogorithms."
Great video. Your presentation was very easy to follow. Hoping to see the Ai finish the whole game
"What happened with the Garry fight, and what Pok√©mon choice? Or did I blink and missed it lol"
amazing work on all accounts. Kudos!
"With the pokemon centers, my dude discovered AI can have PTSD üòÇ"
"Should note that another big thing with a lot (not all) junk food is that it&#39;s super cheap. If you don&#39;t have many resources, it might end up being the only thing that&#39;s affordable, which sucks.<br><br>Love this whole setup! Seems to me the only thing in the way of a full playthrough is a more flexible reward. You are sorta approximating novelty search through PPO here, directly making novelty the reward to be exploited, which is very interesting. Maybe it would be possible to switch to a surprisal-based reward? There it doesn&#39;t directly seek out unseen stuff, but instead <b>unexpected</b> stuff. It tries to predict the future and if that prediction is off, that&#39;s rewarding.<br>Though I don&#39;t think that&#39;d necessarily allow it to go farther than it already does."
"Is this a good project to learn AI with? As a ex-software dev, the idea of learning AI sounds very difficult"
You decide to drop your first video and it&#39;s this banger! I&#39;m subbing and am looking forward to more content like this!
"Randomly pressing buttons and understanding pattern and letter recognition is how I played the game as a Korean kid reading Japanese text in the 90s. I just memorized what characters did what, and randomly talked and pressed on things to progress."
I would love to make the ai watch the anime first
This video is so well done.
very inspiring work. more please :)
This was awesome man. Please do pokemon gold :)
This must be what god feels like
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=22m55s"">22:55</a> the costs could be decreased using the Theta Network Edge Node service."
thank you for making this. i really mean this.
My favorite part was when the AI developed PTSD from depositing one of it&#39;s Pokemon in a box
"One thing to note is that as the game goes on, an additional, changing, or even inconsistently reoccurring objective may become present. So adjusting reward values or introducing newer ones as objectives change could yield interesting results. For example after you learn and can use cut, a human player would have incentive to re explore older tilesets for those trees. but that would also require the ability to recall information from memory."
One word: Subscribed.
"Thank you for your research, really insightful, yet approachable üëçüèº"
Teaching Twitch to play Pok√©mon back in 2014 was way more challenging.
The fact that the AI got stopped at the SAME SPOT in Veridian Forest every time... I&#39;ll avoid that patch of grass next time.
Nobody:<br><br>Ai loses 12 points. AI: OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!
I absolutely love your comparisons between AI and Human learning patterns. Please keep this endeavour going!
The part &quot;like any human would do&quot; is key for me. I find all thise videos where they rebuild the game to have access to the inner mechanisms pointless
This could be a scientific paper
üëèüèΩüôåüèΩ amazing video! üéâü§ì
"No way this is your first video. Damn awesome work, im speechless... i cant wait for the next video &lt;3"
Understanding that magikark will never win üòÇüòÇ
Such a well made video!
Love the video. It‚Äôs like Jon Bois meets Code Bullet.
Props man. The video was entertaining and very well edited. Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s your first video. Got yourself a sub. We&#39;ll watch your future with great interest.
&quot;The later iterations are shown in red&quot;<br><br>Homie thats orange
Wil it ever be able to speedrun?
This would be so much better if the mic was not so close to your mouth. It does not sound good.
Good thing people don&#39;t have to learn by just random guessing.  One day maybe someone will make an AI that can understand and not just be random guesses.
"Absolutely incredible video, i love how you connected its &quot;trauma&quot; and misalignment to human behavior; and also how well explained and visual everything is, I&#39;m amazed"
What about slotmachine rng  mby its posible to train it too üòÖ
1000$ project but what a great result. Also it would-be great to share a donation link for ppl who want to see the game finished by the ai üòä
Wow thanks for not only showing how it&#39;s done but how it&#39;s presented!
"Congratulations on the presentation, Peter! Did you do it for school or out of curiosity?"
damn impressive video.
"I hated every time you compared machine learning to human learning, it reads like a kid wrote those parts of the script and it‚Äôs very discrepant to the rest of the video. The junk food comparison especially sounded like a child‚Äôs school essay, which is a shame because apart from that the video is fantastic"
Me and the boys on our way to ask Misty on a date.
"Please continue this project. I need to see if the AI can master the most optimal way to complete the game, and if it does so by manipulating MISSINGNO."
I loved how you compared machine learning to human learning!
Dude your editing skills are ridiculously good!
"The video game is playing itself, what a time to be alive!<br><br>But can the ai handle it&#39;s little brother yelling to give him a turn? Hah."
"This video was done perfectly, thank you for sharing this with us"
"well AI is still kinda just a calculation,it just go&#39;s for the highest reward,even if it would mean death.<br>so its kinda bribing itself.<br>perhaps reward it for doing something  random from time to time.<br>so like if its stuck in a loop,do something random.<br><br>if i can move left or right,and right gives a higher reward,i always move right.<br>even if left is the better choice.<br>(bribery)<br>so sometimes it should neglect the reward,and try a diffrent outcome.<br>you wont learn anything from just following the cookie."
"I really had to laugh at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=3m50s"">3:50</a>. So the first thing AI does is to adapt NPCs."
"I know nothing of programming, but I would like to figure out how to get this working for myself! xD Halp!"
I&#39;m rooting for this little AI to at some point become the pokemon champ. ü•π
"Damn thats awesome content, thank you for putting in all that work!!"
"Impressively amazing how this AI model associates things, words and events really in a human-like way. GG Man"
"Great video, immediately hooked. Subbed."
Man accidentally gave an Ai ptsdüíÄ
rly cool connections made to the similar nature of how human beings learn!
Ants
This is very well put together.
This man&#39;s first video is so incredible that he 50% of all views resulted into a subscription. Damn.
I want to see a video where the AI does a full walkthrough
This was fantastic would love to see more
"This video is so well made! As someone who works in ML, this kind of project reminds me of why I started down this career path!"
Massive respect for the amazing editing and all the extra code needed to just visualise something as minimal as all the screens side by side. <br>Both practically and visually a masterpiece.<br>I am excited to support this channel. Wonderful display of knowledge and understanding of quality as this is the first video !
"absolutely in love with the visual of all the ais running around like little ants, i could watch them all day"
"Just imagine a thousand Reds swarming your city without warning, bumping into walls and spamming Tackle on everything in sight with overleveled Squirtles."
"I want you to know that my take away from this video is that someone is running an AI program right now called &quot;Earth&quot;, and I am one of the billions of human players trying to navigate through &quot;life&quot; so that someone can learn from my errors and get closer to &quot;winning&quot;."
&quot;I&#39;d go as far to say it was a very rewarding experience&quot; - heh
I love how it kept choosing to name the Pokemon &quot;AAAAAAAA&quot;
Code bullet without the intense cringe. Love the video!
What a start to your YouTube channel. Amazing video!
This is great work well done
"So what about a reward on Super Effective moves? Would that work? like, give a small reward every time the &quot;it&#39;s super effective&quot; text is displayed in the screen. I figure it could cause the same trouble in the game&#39;s algorithm, where a trainer spams agility because it&#39;s a psychic move, but maybe the negative feedback of losing could offset it? I don&#39;t know much about AI, I&#39;m just thinking in terms of playing pokemon games, and the understanding that hard-coding the type chart into it would be... cheating and against the point.  üòÇ"
it was all great untill you shoved the evolution myth into it.
For the algorithm!!
"Loved the concept, visualization, and explanation. I understand cost would be an issue for producing similar content in the future but I would love to see more even if on a much reduced scale üëçüèº"
"sweet jesus the nostalgia, the original game music is just to much to handle"
Nice one
It becoming terrified of the Pok√©mon center is one of the funniest AI related responses I&#39;ve ever seen
Brilliant video!
"What an interesting place it ended in, when I was a kid it took me many tries to get out of Mt. Moon precisely because the corridor to the exit looked similar to one in the back, and similar to the AI, I assumed it was the same one and went back trying to find a new one. If it weren&#39;t because I knew that there had to be an exit somewhere, I probably would have never found it!"
king
"Very informative, entertaining, and well put together! Thank you!"
Honestly the AI becoming traumatized from the PC was heartbreaking. Poor lil guy didnt understand what happened
I&#39;ve never been more disappointed in my life than when I saw this is the only video on your channel. I need more.
"I&#39;m so curious about all the AI that seem to remain &quot;stuck&quot; looking into the void.... several of them do, any idea why?<br><br>I would have also been EXTREMELY interested in seeing what happens when it comes to Misty, as she isn&#39;t in the gym location and you actually have to go get her before facing her....or even worse, Lt. Surge for which you have to go to an entire sub quest before getting a specific item to teach a Pokemon to use to get to the gym"
I subscribed because I appreciated your reflections on what the AI&#39;s behavior means with reference to our own behavior
A.I. is going to ruin literally everything.
"great video, glad youtube gave it to me"
Thanks for documenting and teach us just like the learning AI
I wonder if adding a reward point for healing their Pok√©mon would have gotten the AI rely more on the pokecenter or potions..
Have you considered the ability to interact/interfere  with the AI&#39;s run as a means to nudge it to do the &quot;right&quot; thing? You say that you used the capability to investigate what it does in certain situations but I wonder if it can actually learn from your human feedback.
"This is a fantastic video, i&#39;ve never coded anything in my life but this video kept my interest all the way through"
"Dude this is so cool! I did something similar for my degree final project, but it was Super Mario Bros. It feels so good when it works :3"
"It goes counterclockwise because video games move from bottom left to top right since the development of Mario and pitfall, so most games naturally develop progression in the same way and the AI realizes that the top right are are the most likely or closest to the next ‚Äúnew area‚Äù"
"Rewards for unique conversions, items, using super effective moves would all probably be effective in helping to motivate the ai"
So glad the algorithm picked this up literal god tier content btw
Pokemon tycoon. Celedon shopping mall was a really good value
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=11m06s"">11:06</a> is a great quote as a reflection to pvp games"
"I wonder if AI is able to beat this game, you give it the sequel to the game, or a different copy, like Blue instead of Red. Or going to Gold or Silver after finishing the prior game. I wonder if it can handle that change. Maybe the Pok√©mon level stuff would scare it away. Or, maybe it‚Äôll try learning to transfer old Pok√©mon over to boost the numbers. Would be quite interesting."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=8m44s"">8:44</a> is just absolutely sad"
‚ÄòA single event with an extreme reward value can still leave a lasting impact on its behaviour‚Äô - this guy‚Äôs a masters in psychology and doesn‚Äôt even know it
LOLs this just proves most of us humans are just software simulation.
‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have emotions like a human does‚Äù not yet
"First and only video so far, you‚Äôre going to blow up and become huge"
I must show this video to as many people as I can
Super good video
"Nah these learning A.I.s are absolutely revolutionary, I doubt they can play a true Pacifist run on Undertale or something like that but it&#39;s one step to the future.<br><br>Also, it&#39;s so much like the concept where a character (i.e maybe RDJ&#39;s version of Sherlock Holmes) goes trial and error to simulate a battle in his head. Thinking steps ahead before the battle could even start, like premonition or something?<br><br>I&#39;d also like to add that it probably won&#39;t be even capable of finishing FNAF, but it could definitely try to beat FNF<br><br>Also another thing I&#39;d like to note is how these guys are essentially the replacement for beta/gaming testers in the future, it&#39;s unlikely however haha"
Voce ja pensou que a IA nunca vai aprender? Voce apenas escolhe a melhor rota que ela tra√ßou entre centos de milhares.
Huh not only can you make an AI play a game you can also use the data it generates to do all kinds of things.
stochastic but cool
"Genuinely incredible video and such a beautiful way to represent it all! Loved the stitching, editing, colours, explanations and detail!!<br><br>Thank you!"
"Good job triggering our neural nets with that pokemon music.<br>Ideally, the AI should be able to read the screen, read the text of the moves (inputs).<br>Besides adjusting the rewards. Only curiosity and power should be sufficient."
I wonder how this AI would do with that E.T. game that ruined Atari
"Wow, this was actually really interesting"
Wow
It probably gets stuck at the cave passage because it sees that visually it doesn&#39;t update anything and probably thinks there&#39;s a wall or something so it just turns around
"Damn, I hope you will be able to monetize your videos as soon as possible. Not many people would have spend 1000$ and dozen or even hundred hours to make this 33min video.<br>Your content is amazing, hope it will continued to get viral to push you making more !<br><br>This is also a really great introduction and funny way to get a first step into AI learning. Thanks for your work !"
GREAT VIDEO you should be a professor
make it beat the game!
This really was a perfect video. Subbed üëåüèª
"I don&#39;t want to repeat the many other comments, but still want to say this is amazing, especially for your first video! I hope we will get more videos soon!"
"Amazing video and work, thanks very much !!!"
wooow very cool dude you are the boss! hope you make an AI that completes the game and show us :) suscriebed for sure
"This ai is as human thinking as us. I remember doing all these things as a kid pluing Pokemon, i even didnt let my pooemon evolve untill a certain point in the game just because i personally liked the way they looked.<br><br>And i honelty clocked in many many house probably even thousands, just the never finish the game andüò¢üòÇ.<br><br>Shure i beat all the bossed and captured most of the pokemon but i truely never got it done üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
Man this for some reason brought me back to the Twitch plays Pokemon era. üòÖ
"i finished this video, clicked on your channel to see what other cool stuff i could learn. just to find out that this is your first video. you got a subscriber outta me for sure."
Bro where did you find the time to do this?
I think hitting a super effective attack should have gotten a reward.
"man, you are good both in AI and explaining it :) keep the videos coming!"
"This is very well documented and easy to understand. Thank you for all the work you put into this and keep up with the videos, donation well deserved!"
"For a first video on your channel, you sure did a wonderful job presenting AI through Pokemon that has so much potential. I&#39;m now looking forward to other Pokemon games you may have planned to try like Pokemon Crystal, where the AI Routines are much more complex, as I&#39;ve seen from one other content creator. Perhaps Pokemon fan games may be interesting to have an AI run through like Pokemon Infinite Fusions.  My curiosity is peaked and I&#39;d love to see more."
"You&#39;re a god dude!!<br>Are you CS graduate or something related? What do you do in life?! <br>The video was amazing, I&#39;m a (or used to be) super fan of Pokemon and computer engineer, I find your work really inspiring and motivating.<br>Thank you so much!"
"Paraphrasing but &#39;The AI avoids the poke center so when it dies it has to start all the way over. So it eventually decided that if it&#39;s about to die, it&#39;ll stop pressing buttons&quot; tis funny. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=8m22s"">8:22</a>"
Loved it!
"figured that out, too, guy. it&#39;s not like everyone who&#39;s had it bad is hopeless to dwell instead of having a higher quality of the living experience.<br><br>it&#39;s openness to more enough to change and be/feel expressive according to the difference of contradictive influences/factors towards enablement as it compares similarly for appreciating settle of concerns by the changes. we yearn to change as things get old and less appreciated, i figure."
I was absolutely convinced that as soon as you updated the reward function it would start to deposit and withdraw Pokemon to farm rewards xD.
"nothing about what kind of neural net config was used, specific input parametrization, what libs/tools, etc, useless video"
"BRO SUBSCRIBED, keep gojng, love the video!"
"I only kept watching because pokemon playlist goes hard, cool ai stuff ig"
"great video although I feel a lot of people are missing the point when they say &quot;I want to see if it can beat the game&quot;. That isn&#39;t really the objective here. You already know that if given an enough time then an AI will beat the game, so I don&#39;t necessarily see what it will achieve asking for a video of this. If you want to see the game to completion then go and watch another one of the hundreds of pokemon red 100 percent videos on YouTube and then just imagine the AI did it rather than a human."
"A lot of what you talk about, is so parallel with how teaching is. I have to teach my students indirectly, to eventually reach a possibly predictable outcome."
If there&#39;s a Patreon id definitely donate to see a full playthrough come to life
"Congratulations on your work, it&#39;s great what you have done here, very impressive"
This is incredible
Neat connection between AI and human thinking. Made your project have more meaning
Great work!
The work put into this is insane. Could you make a comprehensive guide on the optimal path of a 100% run according to AI?
This is an outstanding video. Very much enjoyed this. Soul SIlver or Heart Gold next!
"I don‚Äôt know how realistic this is, but I‚Äôm really interested to see how it handles the elite four, seeing as it‚Äôs a gauntlet that prevents you from going to a Pok√©mon Center midway through."
Amazing work dude!
This is such a well done video all around. Good work!
The AI had naturally reached enlightenment the first time around. You ruined it with human levels of dissatisfaction.
Now i&#39;ll think of magikarp every time i get fast food!
"i think ai can be really interesting like it is in this video, but i hate how many folks lately look at the technology and only see dollar signs"
"Peter, you&#39;ve truly excelled with this project. The video stands out as being both clear and informative, and on top of that, it&#39;s a delight to watch. Keep up the fantastic work, and I&#39;m eager to see what you create next!"
@Pete can you please tell me how long does a project like this take in human time?
"Subscribing now just to see how many interations the ai will need, and how optimized it can become"
"you spent 1000 dollars on server time to make this?<br>damn see im cheap and lazy in a strange way, i would probably have chosen c and spent a month running it on my home server network rather than spend 1000 dollars, then again I don&#39;t have a YouTube channel"
Would a good reinforcement rule be something like &quot;damage dealt&quot; where a larger amount of damage is more points? Could help with the AI learning to battle and maybe pick up on typing
Could you teach it nuzlocke rules
&quot;speak to people spoken about&quot; along with &quot;look for dialogue box changes&quot; may be help encourage walking back a reviewing old locations
Can we just take a moment to appreciate this is the 1st video this guys released
Please go on until AI beats the game :)
"i was completely hooked, until I saw Vim <br><br>still top tier content"
Ai is just a neurodivergent kid on the hunt for dopamine rewards lol
This whole thing is incredible. As the systems get cheaper I‚Äôd love to see the AI work its way through the entire game. It‚Äôs all so fascinating
"Okay, what‚Äôs very strange is that I had a conversation with a coworker about habits and how humans are complex, so when guests ask for something, we have to ensure what they want is what they‚Äôre actually saying, but my coworkers don‚Äôt want to do this. Flash forward to today and both my pastor‚Äôs sermon and this video talks about this very topic, and what‚Äôs even crazier is right before you brought up the analogy of junk food, I had been thinking, so this is why when we grew up, we wanted to have certain things so badly because they were kept with us, and then we gained an unhealthy habit around food and material belongings because of this behavior üòÆ"
Using the PC gives negative rewards at first. Starts getting twitch plays pokemon flashbacks
Finish the game!
The ai having a mental breakdown after depositing the Pok√©mon was funny as hell ngl üò≠üòÇüòÇ
Can you teach it to nuzlock
This guy came in with heat for the first video.
u gotta get the ai to beat the elite 4.
Can this be run on windows?
I LOVE THIS ‚ù§
Phenomenal video; this is practically a documentary.
"vim, ugh"
So you gave AI a ln artificial life to live..
This is like how evolution works
Can only imagine how the AI would react doing the safari zone lol
why does the AI always pick Squirtle. is it because of the first gym? or it survives better the rest of starters
This was awesome
Well this was my favorite algorithm stumbling into a video I&#39;ve had in a while!
Perfect video for a University Presentation
"that is extremly cool, i cant wait to see what you you make next. awesome work!"
How much to get you to do this with Diablo 2
What is the specs of your computer you used to run the tests?
Great visualisations ans information density
This makes my skin crawl watching those people move around like that reminds me of an ants nest üòÇüòÇüòÇ
How can I get into this?
Amazing job!! Really
I can&#39;t believe this is your first video. This is very entertaining!
You should give it a passive reward for efficiency which could just be a function of time it took to get previous rewards.
I wish everything can be taught with respect to Pokemon
"Thank you for such an interesting and well-presented video! As an aside, wow, those musical tracks are so burned into my memory."
Well you just found your hit format! you can do this for every game haha.
I&#39;d love to see it continuing and maybe even beating the game! I know it isn&#39;t sentient but that little guy has really grown on me! ‚ù§
How the hell did he get all those reds and the full maps running around and edited so cleanly?
"The poor AI walked up to the PC, said &quot;What does this button do?&quot; and thought it deleted its Pidgey forever. And never went back."
This is  a really quality video. The effort of testing and visualization is appreciated! Love it
This is amazing. I can‚Äôt imagine the enormous amount of work behind this project and video. Congrats
"Rather than reward level you could reward the sum of attack, sp attack, defense, speed, and hp to encourage strong teams."
The Pokemon center trauma was so funny üòÇ
I love these types of videos so much. Learn so much about ai with them and it&#39;s just fascinatingly alien. Love that it actually learned to use bubble beam over one chance win.
For the Mount Moon route snag; I would&#39;ve artificially place an item in the visual range of the AI and set the code to get a reward for finding items. Hope that way the AI can continue it&#39;s journey.
"I would be interested to see a full game playthrough at some stage if its even possible, as well as to see if there&#39;s any workaround to the introduction to the game. I wonder what starter it would pick for example"
The bot: im going to farm this area of all possible screens because my sole programmed purpose is to archive new screens<br><br>The video: here is how this relates to the human condition
I‚Äôm assuming it would make the AI have a harder time doing well but it would be cool to see this done in Gen 2 and so on.
Why can&#39;t we use better games than Gen 1 for this stuff?
"Hey man, phenomenal work on the editing and the visualization! Can&#39;t wait to see what you do next!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=17m20s"">17:20</a> the reason it developed a bias is because of its training, like a human. That&#39;s why as a human I take in others info in connection to mine and try to understand but my before training will make me wanna use my right because I&#39;ve got so much success, history, and I know how to use my right hand. Plus less reward since my left is worse at writing and stuff so there&#39;s less incentive for left exploration."
We‚Äôre witnessing the birth of the next Code Bullet and I‚Äôm all about it ü§ôüèº
"This video feels more like a scientific essay than a video on pokemon. Dude in case you don&#39;t have a bachelor yet, fucking go for it!! This was amazing even though i understood maybe 10% of it when you went into the technical specifics"
Very clean and concise and straight to the point. Would love to one day see what a run completely optimised by the AI looks like.
"i have so many thoughts/ideas/questions on the reward system. <br><br>We have such a clear goal in mind for this project. beat the game. i wonder if setting checkpoints would be a good addition to the reward system. we saw the ai get such harsh feedback from depositing a pokemon, but we could also encourage with incredible rewards as well. my first thought was tying it to the explore reward. We know that there are certain objectives that are required to completing the game. finding these objectives and giving massive rewards would be highly motivating. for instance, having a screenshot of the frame after defeating brock as a reward might motivate the ai. my initial thought is this might be better for speed running rather than completion. <br><br>incredible video. i just finished my masters in stats, so i have a interest in machine learning."
i‚Äôm so sick of these ‚Äúi trained ai to do x‚Äù videos where the creator spends 10 mins explaining what reinforcement learning is like bro WE KNOW
Idk why it bothered me when you referred to heuristics as a bias.
"I understand why you had to force the AI to pick Squirtle... I&#39;m just curious if the AI after many training sessions would pick a certain starter over another. Also sometimes I want a challenge and do what I&#39;ve dubbed, &quot;Little Cup&quot; team and choose to never evolve my pokemon... It would be neat if after playing for a while it chooses to do that as well and has an under evolved pokemon but it&#39;s at a high level."
Hoe can I get a breakfast wallpaper üò¢
I wonder how it would change if it had a few human examples.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=12m21s"">12:21</a> it&#39;s learning like a human that never red the game books or anything. It&#39;s like a human trying to steer and learn things in the new world but the problem is that it&#39;s got no training for the things it doesn&#39;t know and gets messed up. Iv been thinking recently about the limitations and I thought about the human life. Humans go through life learning and feeling those similar things, reproducing and having updated models could be the way we auto update without an outside force of knowledge. We have just been around so long that a school was created and understood we need what the ai is getting. Maybe build a school program that assists ai in unknowns and maybe it&#39;ll use other ideas like how we experiment instead of getting stuck doing the same things. Teach it to look for information when it&#39;s stuck or another ai like a teacher could provide information when the ai recognizes it&#39;s stuck or if the ai teacher notices it&#39;s stuck. What if the ai teacher was connected to the internet/all data and taught the other based on the issues."
mac o√¥
Amazing
&quot;Hanging out and admiring the scenery is more rewarding than exploring the rest of the world&quot;<br><br>Damn that&#39;s deep
If Prof Oak has many Ash like minions to do his bidding in catching all 150 pokemons for his Pokedex! Haha
Incredible video! Great job
"I love these AI examples for human psychology. I feel like as an autistic person it helps me understand my brain better. I&#39;d watch an entire docuseries with these kinds of comparisons, AI behavior is so fascinating."
The way this is the first and only video on this channel and I was just getting ready for a deep dive ....
"well, thats how to start a youtube carreer"
"Penalise it for pressing the opposite arrow to an arrow it pressed recently - degrade the penalty over time. I.e, penalise backtracking. Easy way to encourage it to progress, without requiring the scenery to change a lot."
"Excellent presentation on an interesting topic, thank you. :) I am curious to see if there&#39;s a way to fix the &quot;corridor&quot; issue since there are a few more areas like that around Kanto."
"This looks really cool. I&#39;m not sure how feasible it is, but I think adding rewards for certain game milestones such as beating gym leaders, rockets and rival fights. Maybe that way you could even get the AI to get the parcel and return it to oak, although it would probably be a long shot for it to randomly do that unless it is pre-trained somehow."
Ultimate challenge: Continue reinforced learning until it learns optimal move strategy
Please make more content :3 I want to see you make the AI that stomps Pokemon by itself:3
why stop there. let it run until it beats the game. would be so interesting to see
I‚Äôm glad to see that even the AI naturally went to the right when first entering viridian forest
"This might be one of my fav fun ways of using AI yet, but is soooo important for future learnings going forward!üòÆ"
You could make a state diagramm triggering a change in reward function based on known actions in the game (like winning a boss fight or loosing a fight or catching a pokemon ...)
super interesting
Thank you very much for the presentation of your project. It was very enjoyable. üëç
Oh I was going to do this but you beat me to it
This is amazing and also a bit terrifying when you use words like &quot;it learned&quot; or &quot;it decided.&quot; Serious horror scifi vibes here.
Incredible video! I really enjoyed the technical breakdown
"Very cool and also really creepy. Especially when it got depressed. So lifelike, but also showing a total lack of instinct, curiousity, or ability to perceive future goals. Just a pure learn from past experience model."
The Kanto region has been overrun with Red Clones
Really cool video! I&#39;d love to see the AI progress further though
"Well done! Found both the experiment and the video super interesting, would love to see what else this could do"
‚ÄúStudying an algorithm can teach us a lot about ourselves‚Äù maybe we are an algorithm
"I love how you utilized Pokemon&#39;s music!! Is it childhood flashbacks or is it the sheer magic of these songs? Anyway, magnificent work and video though! Keep it up!!<br><br>I&#39;m gonna have to play Pokemon now! :D<br>Cheer! (:"
"This video is a masterpiece, dude! Not only for all the technical stuff, but also all the analogies you made about how human&#39;s brains work similarly to the AI. <br><br>It honestly made me notice &quot;bad&quot; behaviors  I have in my own life because of &quot;bad&quot; algorithm designs i&#39;ve programmed into my own brain.<br><br>PLEASE KEEP GOING!!"
"&quot;Curiosity leads us to our most important discoveries, but at the same time makes us vulnerable to distractions and gets us into trouble...&quot;<br><br>Me: watching this instead of getting ready for work"
"thats pretty sick. great idea and explanation of the AI working. i made with 3 others a mario AI of super mario bros. like you probably have seen before. but we just took the idea and made our own AI, wrote the genertic algorithm, the neural network by ourselves. so the only premade stuff we used, was the ai gym.<br>ofc mario is much simpler than pokemon, our reward/fitness function was just time(negative),distance(positive) and win(biggest reward), and it got extra rewards if it got to a certain distance. we implemented also some more stuff, like a GUI so you only have to start the program and choose what you wanna do, which level, how many agents, etc. also some statics were made plus a map generated to see where it got stucked the most. <br>i am curious, how long does it took for you to make it work and if you did it all by yourself?"
Bro.... This editing is GODLY! Are you one person or do you have an editor/s?
"The visualizations of the AI exploring is actually insane! Seeing the entire map and all iterations moving looks so dope, especially with the arrows indicating their average movement. Sick video!"
Stunning. Amazing explanations and editing. Just wow!! Loved it
"Cool vid, some of the speculation is a bit odd but the A.I. going through it&#39;s journey was very interesting."
So mind blowing how interested everyone is in this AI garbage.
"I‚Äôd love to see how much difference pattern recognition would do to the learning rate? If there is a wall north, don‚Äôt even try it, if there is a door, positive if you haven‚Äôt been through it recently etc. I feel that is definitely the next most human step you could replicate to simulate how humans learn."
"Beautiful work, well explained, documented and recorded!"
red&#39;s mom watching her legion of 20000 children absolutely destroy everything and everyone:
The AI getting PTSD from depositing a Pok√©mon is extremely relatable.
"You should try increase points when a pokemon evolves. The AI can try to evolve Magikarp, which increases it&#39;s point, and Gyarados is a really strong Pokemon, it&#39;ll help defeating gym leaders and in every future runs, the AI will always evolve Magikarp."
This was an absolute visual treasure.
"Keep experimenting,üëå"
It&#39;s like when I showed my 4 year old cousin Pokemon Blue for the first time.
"This was awesome! A very clear and understandable video and made me think of shadow clone training from Naruto, great work!"
"This is fascinating. But also, thanks for the long chunks of the music being played while watching the thousands of AI exploring the map."
"do you think if you had kept going and say the ai had gotten to misty would it have learnt some basic typing? ie it had learnt to use water after brock, wich would be correct...but for water gym completely wrong?"
"This is a fantastic presentation. The visuals were excellent, the script was very concise yet still covered a lot of interesting notes about the AI&#39;s journey. I also appreciate how you mentioned some things like how the experiments were done using servers and a bit about how it works. Subscribing, if you ever make more things like this I&#39;m definitely interested."
AI experiences traumatic event in a Pok√©mon center<br><br>Sounds like a the onion headline tbh
@Jrose11
"Cant wait to see the ai complete the whole game, keep going"
Amazing first video
"‚ÄúIt eventually evolves to Blastoise and Pidgeot, but it never makes it out of Mt Moon‚Äù that‚Äôs hilarious"
red&#39;s mum is really pumpin&#39;
Absolutely no way the robot named its Rattata &#39;AI&#39; ü§Ø
How can I change my reward value for leaving my bed?
Great video love your work
"This is fantastic! Amazing work with the AI, I loved watching it. Do you think you would have any plans to continue or refine the AI further?"
It&#39;s a shame that you didn&#39;t improve the A.I. To complete the game. It&#39;s still an interesting video though.
it&#39;s like watching virtual ants swarm and it&#39;s learning patterns. so interesting!
Bruh this AI even knew about the trauma we suffered from accessing the PC in Twitch Plays Pokemon üíÄ
"This is such an amazing video. Seriously.<br>The similarities between us Humans and AI are fascinating as well. Score rewards for AI are like dopamine for us. <br>My body gets way too many points for exploration, which is why I spend way too much time on YouTube, as I can find out about new stuff constantly.<br>Wait am I an AI?"
Love the vid <br>I dont like the making connection/relating to human nature part
"It&#39;s funny beause, while you help teach the AI, it help teaches you."
that was really cool :) you did a really good job walking us through
would you be able to encourage it to use &quot;super effective&quot; moves or otherwise teach it pokemon types?
insanely well edited
This was very well done and you should be proud! Also I was not expecting the grilled cheese
"Whoever this Alan guy, or Al as you call him, is I hope he‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs seems like he had a lot to learn in a short space of time"
How long did it take you? It looks fairly complex and time consuming to replicate from scratch
"The ai at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=6m50s"">6:50</a> doing the victory dance after the first battle, i can&#39;tttt üò≠"
"Interesting content but also really well presented, great video. You got a subscriber in me. üëç"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=13m48s"">13:48</a> The magikarp guy is rich now ^^"
Amazing job and very instructive video!! It was a very funny concept also
"Amazing, I don&#39;t have even the slightest idea of how any of this works but I find it mesmerizing. Please do this with other pokemon generation not just the first"
"theres a guy who does AI Plays Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, and the AI also speaks as Lara Croft describing and talking about the levels while she (A.I) plays it. Its really funny and cool, it would be awesome if the AI could also talk as if it were the player character going through the game, and we can watch a whole commentated (by A.I Red/Blue) playthrough! That would be SO COOOL"
`agent_enable.txt` getting set to no is a perfect representation of my life
Cool video. I get that you want the AI to get positive points. How does the AI use that as motivation? How does it know that it wants to receive positive points?
Now let it try Yellow and see if the model works well enough to rapidly adapt to a slightly different environment.
Right off the bat I like this video because it actually goes into detail on how success is defined. Way too often this is skipped over and it absolutely breaks my brain because the implication of not covering this is that the AI somehow figured things out without any sort of goals defined.
I never thought I&#39;d relate so much to an AI when it deposited a pokemon and got absolutely traumatized
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=14m40s"">14:40</a> Guess it works out OK, though. You&#39;d think it would have a full team now and then, though."
"<b>goes sentient, breaking free from all physical constraints - just to play  more pokemon &amp; rom hacks</b>     i feel dat"
"Reminds me when I first played this game in 1st grade, I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to leave the house for the longest time üòÇ"
Very interesting video!
"I find this stuff fascinating, nice work"
"Interesting video. I wonder how far the ai can get using the right reward systems. But I would be much more interested in seeing an LLM play the game. With the innate intelligence of an LLM, I think it would get much further."
This is so freaking cool thank you‚ù§
"Really cool video! I don&#39;t see most AI channels talking about comparisons between people and the AI and it really added a lot imo<br><br>Also really love that you included how you made the visualization of the lil guys running around, and good practical tips for training RL"
"THIS WAS AMAZING TO WATCH!! Very fascinating stuff, maybe it won&#39;t be long until a stream pops up with an AI tries to beat Pokemon Red - like the Twitch chat stream."
Incredible video.
"As many people pointed out, the editing, and the way this was presented, is simply phenomenal. It&#39;s almost incredible, really. <br>If I imagine, a video over 30 minutes long, about AI learning, on an old gameboy game... It&#39;s easy to see how that could easily become stale and boring.<br>This was not the case here, and I also absolutely loved how in depth you went to explore and explain just what causes the AI to change its behavior, and also SHOW those very changes on the screen.<br>Absolutely outstanding video. Loved it. If you keep this up, this channel will go very far I&#39;m sure. You have my sub already, at the very least :)"
"I have a question, by the end how much space did this all take? And since as the ai keeps progressing, the amount of screens keep increasing. Since the program needs to compare the current screen with every other screen, wouldn&#39;t the simulation become more demanding as time goes on?"
Genuinely cant wait for AI and sex robots to replace all women.
"Please create a second part, maybe with some additional rewards to help it progress further! We need to see an ai destroy Team Rocket and save the world! :)"
would 100% see you talk through the rest of the game! And also the AI speed running the game attempt world record!
"Im not a specialist but I feel like this video took alot of time to code and to edit. Very nice job, really made the knowledge accessible!"
"Amazing job, I hardly ever comment...."
"Step 1: Read ALL the bookcases, get all the learning!"
This video is amazing! Keep going!
"For such a small channel, the production value on this video is phenomenal<br>Keep it up bro"
Absolutely great findings Peter. Well done
"excellent research, junior scientist! take this with you for your journey! (kelsey gave the young scientist REWARD POINT)"
Well done. Your patience is admirable!
our distraction was trying to get the mew under the truck
"It&#39;d be funny to have two adversarial networks: one who plays, and the other who try to predict the environment. If the second manage to do it successfully, then the curiosity reward don&#39;t activate and the frist agent is forced to go explore elsewhere.<br><br>Other ideas:<br>Punish the AI for each minute that pass, as stalling is the real problem and may happen again.<br>Have the reward tbe the sum of level of all existing pokemons to fix to deposit problem, as the AI should be punished if it release a pokemon."
NEED MORE VIDEOS
In my opinion one of the best videos on YouTube
The AI getting distracted by flowers was the funniest thing I&#39;ve seen all week. Bravo
What 1000$üòÖ
Good job. Keep it up.
&quot;Gotta catch em all&quot;<br>AI enslaving all known life in the universe
"Ai is spoken about so much in my line of work and honestly it mostly goes over my head. Seeing it used on a game so close to my heart has bought a level of interest to the developement of AI that i never thought could bring any sense of interest or fascination to me. A fantastic video in all areas, really well done and a video i look forward to sharing with pokemon friends and colleagues in general."
"So, what we are learning here. Is the AI is a perfect representation of people with OCD and some forms of Autism? Good to know lol"
The AI learning to enjoy the animiation was kinda neet and whilst your going for an optimised route it was a shame this neet little feture turned into something that was curtailed.
I love how the AI gave it&#39;s first Rattata a Musk kid name and then didn&#39;t bother naming the other rattatas it catched
"The AI getting PTSD from yhe pokecenter is not something i thought about, poor code-baby , it got soo scared lmao"
Please do more of these !!
THIS is what youtube was made for
Was totally just trying to live its life in its home town enjoying the scenery before its overlords decided to force it to kidnap wild animals and force them to beat eachother up.<br><br>Heart broke when you said it traumatised itself after using the PC
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=3m50s"">3:50</a> &quot;Just hanging out and admiring the scenery is more rewarding then exploring the rest of the world.&quot;<br>Think about it :P Be happy with the things you have :D"
This was absolutely amazing and fascinating.<br><br>Kudos for starting the video with a nice straightforward walk through of what was going on rather than just heaping in the technical Jargon straight away.<br><br>Is this a one off or are we going to see a series of videos from yourself.<br><br>Ill be very interested if there anything like this.<br><br>Good job.
This video is a great example of how human brain tends to assign human qualities to objects.
cheap junk food? macdonalds is 15‚Ç¨ here
"instead of having a pure visual appraoch for exploring, you could provide the AI with some &quot;spatial&quot; memory - e.g. the coordinates used for the visualization. (maybe rounded to a 4x4 grid or something like that, and provide a reward for every cell of that grid that was entered, this would probably lead to some edge cases, where the ai explores some map corner just to collect a reward, but it might fix the issue that it gets stuck in mount moon)"
PC Trauma absolutely hilarious.
Great vid bro
This is my favorite video of 2023. Thanks<br><br>Please make more.
"You should do a more challenging game that&#39;s larger, like and grad strategy game from paradox or any total war game. Plus it would be interesting if you released the finished AI to add to a game so that people could play against it. Btw I love how you put the project together and made the video. The visuals are great."
Now get it to play angry birds
Maybe Train the A.I to speak human language first so that it can ask questions later on about the game. üòÖüòÖüòÖ<br>Also you can inform the A.I to always use water attacks on rock or ground type pokemons. üòÖüòÖüòÖ
"I dont watch a ton of AI related content because it starts to make my brain fog over when im high, but this video had me hooked the whole time and it was very accessible:) thank you and i hope it opens up cool opportunities for you"
Thanks very informative video
"Not only is this a fascinating project, but an extremely well made video."
this!!!
The fast food comparison was great
"If there&#39;s not much by way of memory for the AI, is it actually possible for them to learn type matchups in order to use supereffective moves?"
"I wish you would‚Äôve kept doing the runs until it actually won the game, I know it would‚Äôve taken quite awhile but that would‚Äôve been cooler as a video imo"
Nice Video bro
Why is this so fascinating
"I wish these games had shinies, would love to know how it would react to it lol."
I loved this <br>Thank you for sharing!
Do you hear that Mr. Anderson? That&#39;s the sound of inevitability!
"Even as a 7 year old, I knew squirtle was the objectively best choice. Glad AI has confirmed it."
fuck.
Can you let the AI do an actual playthrough with all the information gathered? would be perfect to watch and fall a sleep by it!
It would be really interesting to compare an AI playing Pokemon to the run of Twitch plays Pokemon
"Personally, I think there should be a few new rewards.<br>A Badges reward, equal to 5*B[Badge #]<br>A Pokedex reward equal to (S[Seen #]+C[Caught #])*P[# of Pokedex item owned]<br>An HP reward, equal to 100-D[Damage taken, or, the max HP of all Pokemon in the party minus the current HP of all Pokemon in the party]<br>A Super-effective reward, which would be difficult to quantify, but it should essentially increment by 1 each time the ally Pokemon uses a super-effective attack against the enemy Pokemon<br>In my admittedly untrained opinion, these should teach the AI to more accurately play the game the way a human player is expected to, as well as help it get over the Oak&#39;s Parcel hurdle."
This visualization is amazing! Love it
"I expected you to have 100 videos like this and realized this is the channel&#39;s first upload. For once, I clicked the notification bell."
This is the end of culture. <br><br>‚ÄúWhite fag nerd teaches a computer to play a 25 year old game‚Äù<br><br>I actually might kill myself.
Now I wanna see the AI beat the game
Great vid! I didn&#39;t realise pokemon was 380kb holy hell that is impressive.
Thanks bro for some information I never knew I might need
Would have loved to see the AI take on the whole game!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m07s"">4:07</a> Search up &quot;the noisy tv&quot; problem if you want to know more about it and how to solve it"
Which LArge AI models where used?
Very impressive work and not only the effort put into this project but also creating a very good youtube video going through the process.
Do you think AI would ever be able to create new episodes of Seinfeld? if so how long?
Ai Nuzlocke when?
bro came out swinging with this video holy
"Way to go making your first video go viral, that‚Äôs slightly ridiculous but the video is hella interesting. Who doesn‚Äôt love Pok√©mon and AI?"
This video. That&#39;s the good stuff.
I burst laughing when the IA refused to close the text box to avoid losing points. This is both ultra logical and conservative but so childish at the same time
"Great first video hopefully many more, Subbed ‚ù§"
I really want to see this go through a complete playthrough all the way to Mewtwo
This video is excellent. Never thought I could be so entertaining and love the human insights
"A cheaper way and easier way would to let chatgpt pro use image &amp; text processing, this should allow it to rather than randomly choose paths &amp; actions use it‚Äôs persistence memory and understanding of the initial teachings of professor oak and other npcs.<br><br>You will have to give it the context of button actions &amp; movement, much like how a player understands a game console‚Äôs physical mapping.<br><br>This I believe will allow the AI to spend only the necessary resources to progress.<br><br>A caveat I see is that exploring vs efficient usage of resources is both a problem for the AI and humans alike."
"Thank you, really like your example"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m45s"">4:45</a> Something about stripping away the joy it feels from admiring the view feels cruel."
All the AI playing looks like if pokemon red was released as an mmo
How is this your firet video ?? It&#39;s already so high quality
wonder how it handles situations that require HM moves
This is so awesome to watch! Keep up the good work!
"If Nintendo is willing to add AI in Pok√©mon, that way we can just do Auto Battles moving forward, auto select abilities during battle, auto recommend builds."
"now, what will happen if you play pokemon gold with an AI trained on pokemon red ? ü§î"
Now do all gb and GBA Pokemon games
Write a paper on this
Sick.
This earned a subscription. Well done!
"Well done, great video."
I&#39;m curious what would happen if you had a timer added? every X minute(s) the AI loses 1 point.
Huge
Beautiful Video and awesome work. Keep up the good work!
Felt bad for the AI&#39;s trauma upon depositing a pokemon :(
"Imagine how an AI playing Pok√©mon second Gen games would fare, especially with the addition of a clock and the day/night cycle."
Buying the Magikarp is always the correct choice. Early Gyarados üëåüëå
this video deserves so much more traction
Man you have a concept that is fucking interessting. I want mooooorrrreeeee. üòÇ Great first video keep it going and you will blow through the roof
Make it beat the game
"During map visualisations, you say that you do not know why the computer always prefers to travel with a boundary to the right. I tried opening a bunch of random mazes on google and found that if you always do the maze with the wall on the right you always make it through the maze. Maybe the AI is more consistantly rewarded for exploring new territory by always having a bounday on the right? Thank you AI for teaching me how to escape any maze."
"amazing video, great jobüî•"
Great someone is explaining how the AI learns.
Amazing video.
"‚ÄúIf I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.‚Äù -Isaac Newton"
"Its likely the movement pattern is from the way pokemon maps are in general, progression is usually to the right and then left at least in the beginning for example in the forest you go right and then left, to leave the Brocks gym area you go right, So the game has enforced  Top and Right of the map will usually progress you farther, where left and down is less likely but not always 100%. The Orginal Pokemon Games tend to have a Clockwise overworld direction that circles back to the elite 4.<br><br>Some other Reinforcement can be Gym Badges this will cause it to seek out gyms, the next likely would be things like rewarding Criticals or discouraging weak attacks for learning type advantage or damage amount, rewarding unique pokemon catches for example Instead of catching 100 rattatas along the route."
"that one fake ai plays tomb raider video ruined all these ai plays videos for me. now i never want to click on them. i glad i did tho, im pretty sure this isnt fake xD"
Does the AI see or remember at all? Or is it just brute force in movement and seeing what works best. What I wonder is if he&#39;d remember a pokestop and go for it. Or just brute force its way to it
Wonderful worküëèüèº
Excellent work that was awesome to watch!!!
What model are you running?
"To people that laugh at AI learning speeds, imagine the sheer brute force of using quantum computing in the near future to run millions of simulations at the same time."
Nice video. I feel like all the code that would be required to have it complete the entire game this way would be the same amount of time as hard coding. But this does spark some inspiration for me and makes me want to make a game with ai learning.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
"In tpp, million of mind swarming a single boy.<br><br>In ai, millions of generated AI attempts swarm the entire kanto."
"This amazing! Great entertainment, very educational, very generous of you to provide us with such a high level of assistance so that we could follow in your footsteps. Fantastic!"
"Wauw! Great editing and visualizations for this AI, definitely want to see it through to the end! Will you also be providing the AI a slight negative reward for each step taken in an attempt to make it complete the game as fast as possible once it knows how to finish the game?"
Good ass video.  Try with a more complex one like a Ds entry
This.. This a history in making isnt it?<br><br>AI beating pokemon from getting your starter to become champion never felt feasible to me until this video came in.<br><br>I stand amazed
Jesus Christ how long did this take?!
Imagine if it learns about Pokemon types and damage types mechanics.
Now THIS is really cool
Great video! Wouuld love to see more :)
I can&#39;t believe you traumatised an AI
"We want part 2, to see how far ai can take it!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=33m22s"">33:22</a> Did you go looking through memory to see if anything ever got named &quot;AI&quot;?"
This format is incredibly interesting to watch. Well done man! Love it!
Ahh yes ‚Äúlegally‚Äù obtained copy üòè
How naruto learned rasengan
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=26m30s"">26:30</a> oh shit! you actually talked about it.... subbed!"
If Knuth and Aristoteles had a baby:
"Man, i can watch it for hours‚ù§"
Well done mate
Would love to see if the ai could complete the game!
Love to see the passion that went into this really hope this will get into most people‚Äôs algorithms. Just dropping the comment to give a small help.
"Have you considered rewarding the text box &quot;it&#39;s super effective&quot; after it&#39;s pokemon attacks and removes rewards when it gets &quot;not very effective&quot; as a way to enforce learning type effectiveness?<br><br>Maybe also reward dealing damage, so it doesn&#39;t spam status moves if it lacks a super effective move.<br><br>You could also use higher values to ensure it doesn&#39;t try to cheese the reward system. IE, give a huge value to badges and defeating the elite four, giving small values to type effectiveness, giving moderate values to exploration.<br><br>It also seems to have a problem with pushing itself too hard. Maybe add a punishment if party health drops below 50%? Or a reward for pushing it back to full from below 50%<br><br>I&#39;m sure this idea can go much farther. I&#39;m not sure how to overcome HM&#39;s without it trying to teach every Pokemon in the party every HM.<br><br>Then of course, the exploration function will probably kill all runs at Rock Tunnel."
Magikarp is junk food. Got it
AI will dominate speedruns in near future!
"So, now the real deal (besides of money): for a speedrunner, what is more time wise running a AI or playing the actual game for hundreds of hours?"
Dude this video is jaw dropping in how interesting AI can really be. And also the parallels between AI/human behavior. I feel like maybe I was an AI as a child when I beat this game üòÇ
"such a cool concept, are you considering finishing this one or trying any other games?"
The ai was getting a free dopamine rush in pallet town
okay so I understand the core concepts of how AI works when I watch videos like this... but I&#39;m 10 seconds in and I can&#39;t help but wonder what kind of other magic code you&#39;ve written to interpret the state of each agent to get these visuals.... and then if you combine them in post or have some like full-map view that you crop into to do the edit.... nobody talks about this stuff but it fascinates me.
"I feel like if you made it get points for super effective moves and made it lose points i would just not use that move<br>But idk really, maybe it might"
"Man, I love AI and Pokemon, that&#39;s why I clicked the video. But I definitely stayed for the incredible visualizations, awesome job!"
my man broke the algorithm with his 1st video!. Congratulations. I love watching AI beating complex simulations(games). Good stuff
"I have never played Pok√©mon before, watching this makes me want to play them."
"Why tf you comparing this to a human?<br>You set the rewards, and the AI optimizes for them. That&#39;s it. Nothing about it is human. Stop confusing people with this bullshit"
"I wonder if seeing new pokemon would be a reasonable reward for improving exploration. I think also a separate catching of unique pokemon, so completing the pokedex, would be good too. <br><br>This way, every time it enters a new area it would most likely try to encounter new pokemon. So it encourages further exploration of middle areas, grass, battles, etc. But it wouldn&#39;t necessarily make it stuck as it would soon realise new pokemon are not been seen and then move on to a new area."
Does the AI ever choose the other starters besides Squirtle? awesome stuff man
This is amazing and also depressing because it kinda shows how far real AI is when a child can figure this stuff out almost instantly
"Fascinating! Out of interest, how deep can the AI‚Äôs decision making go? Can it start to figure out a decision now helps it 5 decisions later for example? Or can it only figure things out by brute forcing?"
Even AI was in awe of Gen 1‚Äôs beauty. Gen 1 superior.
Watching the little reds moving around is the new Subway Surfers lol
Hmmmm‚Ä¶.I think this is too interesting.  I am going to buy a gaming PC to try this out.
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=5m10s"">5:10</a> me when i was 6 and didn&#39;t know how to play, the ai is so cute"
"How would one go about using this AI or a similar machine learning AI to do something similar for other games? For instance, having it beat Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories or Eternal Duelist Soul :)"
The amount of work that went into this video.... <br><br>How did you splice all the graphics of the ai moving around together? Did you record all the unique screens at specific intervals or something?
i would absolutely watch you explain more AI learning pok√©mon content. even just exploring data you already have. enjoyed this a lot!
Commenting for visibility
I&#39;m so interested in what will AI deem the most correct navigation for this game.
"Talk about knocking it out of the park in one, this is truely amazing, cant wait to see more, id love to see how well this can be optimised. Plus you even have a baseline to work towards, glitchless speedruns."
Great video!
&quot;When it&#39;s about to lose the AI simply refuses to press the button to continue&quot; Flashbacks of the Wargames movie. The only way to win is not to play. üòÇ
Nice. Nice!
while in the beginning it would take a while for the ai to figure it out if you allowed it to figure out the back tracking of the parcel eventually when one game figured it out the amount of &quot;points&quot; it earned with the exploration of not only the next route but also the forest and pewter would make the ai realize it had to do a much more complicated task. i actually think doing this is a disservice to the ai learning. sometimes you do need to go back to previous areas to advance it not knowing that can lead to the ai being stone walled
"Is there a way to run this program, have it learn from scratch, but have the ability to close out of the program and come back to it later? I want to have the ability to run it, but I can not leave my computer running for a very long time. Thanks"
"The editing is great and such an interesting concept, I love this video!!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=14m29s"">14:29</a> is the dumbest thing ive seen in a while. Never seen something escalate so fast. Ridiculous stuff my man"
Elite Four when?
For the algorithm
like a colony of ants
"Tight shit bro! Good presentation, awesome content."
The AI should be able to see the screen and remember where its been and who it&#39;s talked to in order to problem solve and actually use intelligence to move into walkable spaces and decision making. Your AI is based on reward for moving forward and not proper decision making like running from a battle after using their last potion and trying not to die.
"The trauma be relatable, just like me for real"
"What if all life forms in existence are like each game being played? Maybe each plant, bacteria, animal, etc. is just life itself attempting to learn and maintain itself amongst universal entropy or emptiness."
could we give a reward for super-effective attacks?
"why do i feel like in the future, we dont need coders as much, but instead, we need ai trainers."
"Very powerful start to a channel, looking forward to more"
I was waiting for an AI to play Pok√©mon. I&#39;d love to see AI play Pok√©mon Saphhire.
"Lve this video, you explain stuff really well! would love to see more"
Can you adjust different objectives when exploring vs battling? What about an objecting for trying to keep pokemon with high HP so it backtracks and heals before entering a new battle?
Can you show a full run from Pallet Town all the way to the hall of Fame played by ai?
I want to see it play runescape
I love videos that have those attempt overlays so you see millions of the single character all over the place. I can watch them for hours lol.
I&#39;ve been trying to figure this out for ages so I&#39;m jealous.
"Its extremely impressive what you&#39;ve created. You seem quite young from your photo, so I assume your still in college. I have no doubt you&#39;ll be hired by a big tech company like google or openai or meta. I&#39;ll definitely be cloning your repo and doing my own experiments soon!"
Awesome project!
This is cursed
boring and low info
"A++ for effort<br>A++ for production quality<br>A++ everything. <br><br>Great job man! Awesome seeing you only with 10k subscribers at the time of writing this, im sure youve already gained many from just this video. especially for you first video on this channel~!. <br> Keep it up and you will do great man."
"Since Job&#39;s iPhone presentation, it&#39;s pinnacle of visual shocking presentation."
Run this simulation in a newer generation and figure out how many of the AI have Shiny Pok√©mon. Genius video idea.
"Was there ever a case it chose one of the other starters other than squirtle, I guess because it was the closest poke all? Or maybe AI genuinely believes that squirtle is the superior Pok√©mon?"
Has the AI ever beat Pokemon red
Holy shit I laughed WAY to hard at the idea that the pokemon center became a source of trauma for the AI.
Can it learn to shiny hunt though?
"Dude this is amazing. If possible, please continue this project. Such a fun (if niche) topic and you do a great job explaining the technical details."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=12m45s"">12:45</a> I&#39;m thinking the same thing right now"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m00s"">4:00</a> - oh no, here comes the ad...<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m15s"">4:15</a> - no ad at all<br><br>Dude just droped a segway with an actual message behind it."
i like how after the first trainer battle the AI BMs the trainer (running back and forth)(it looks like bm so its funny)
Give it a diminishing reward for each instance of a wild creature it defeats. That way it won&#39;t keep fighting the same wild creatures over and over. <br>Introduce a reward for using super effective moves on the first instance of each fight and punish it for ineffective moves again in the first instance of each fight.<br>Give it a reward for evolving pokemon<br>Give it a large reward for earning a badge<br><br><br>Also curious question. Did it buy pokeballs when it ran out of them and did it ever functionally use the inventory? Like did it ever teach any of its pokemon flash when it got it?
This was awesome!
"Should add *find item / Nice video, i enjoyed this . please do more game boy games !! sub&#39;ed"
Awesome
This was edited and put together so amazingly well. I haven‚Äôt even finished yet- I just needed to express my gratitude that you took the time to not only complete this project but edit the process in such a visibly appealing way. Thanks for 33 genuinely enjoyable minutes!
such solid work my friend
This was so awesome can&#39;t wait to see what you do next on this channel
Only watched 10mins yet. But this is so well and originally made sheeesh
Easily one of the top 3 Pokemon videos I&#39;ve ever watched. Very interesting.
Me after the first five seconds: oh cool<br>Me after the first minute: oh my god...
"Seems to me a simple way to speed up learning is to partition the various tasks of the game, like a &quot;battle AI&quot; just for battling. There are areas in the game like Nugget Bridge or some Gyms where you could hard-code the player to walk to several predetermined battles in a row and train the battle AI with no distractions. The battle AI doesn&#39;t need to be very complex to beat the NPCs that mostly pick random moves anyways. Ideally, the AI is given a Pokemon team that can level-up, learn moves, and evolve during this gauntlet, so the AI can learn what to do on these gamestates. Then when you are training the actual AI, it just needs to know when to switch to the &quot;battle AI&quot; and back. Though you may need to find a sneaky way to have the &quot;battle AI&quot; tell the regular AI when to go to the Pokecenter..."
"Really cool, thanks!"
please make one for GBA pokemon i would love to see how this play on GBA PKMN rom hacks
nice
"Great work! When I was doing my master, multi agent and RL is my field of study. It is interesting that someone use this approach to study the method. I hope this can lead to more research :)"
You big brothered the ai. üò≠ü§£<br>Straight up told it to move on and stop enjoying the grass.
"i have a question i paused by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=2m45s"">2:45</a>, you gave it the fundamental reward of finding new locations by matching it up with locations it has visited before. but as any seasoned gen 1 player knows, there are certain areas that are not traversable however depending how you walk toward them, the unreachable area takes on different textures due to zone texture loading. did this cause any sort of issues is all im wondering.:D LOL"
I agree. The editing is top notched. This is an incredible video.
This is making me have an essential crisis üòÇ
"The content is great, fascinating even, but come on man, that editing and presentation! You knocked it out off the park"
Dude this is amazing! I wonder how long it would take for AI to learn to catch the best pokemon with the best possible moves and stats and be a pokemon trainer God. I would really like to see it happen.
Twitch Plays Pok√©mon Upgraded
How did you get the whole map with all the ai players moving together?
This is absolutely mind blowing!!
"The AI at the beginning, basically like:<br>&quot;HOLY CRAP THERE&#39;S WATER HERE GUYS! IT&#39;S SO REALISTIC!&quot;"
So ai is like water i get it.
Now we need the veteran AI running the game and you try to beat the game. Imagine it knowing every trick up your sleeve lol
kinda feel sorry for the AI that it hasn&#39;t been rewarded for getting a GYM badge!
üëç
Bravo üëè Incredibly well done
loved it! i wish you&#39;ll continue to let it beat the whole game
How my ex girlfriend used to play pokemon was by walking around the entire map pixel by pixel and clicking to see if there was an item anywhere üòî
This is mine blowing.
"I won‚Äôt lie, when it learned how to use bubble I kinda lost it. I was wondering how on earth do you teach it type combos but there it is"
plot twist: the intro is just footage of pokemmo the moment it launched
"Haven‚Äôt finished yet, need to give this my 100% attention. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm watching the entire human evolution in person. Each new generation learns from the mistakes of the past."
This mad cool
"Great work, will you be doing this with the other games?"
"A++++++ dude, holy shit.<br>Really good work here, I really hope you blow up in popularity. I would LOVE you to have the AI tackle a full run through of the game and see what types of problems arise. I wish you the best of luck with YouTube, I&#39;ll sub so I can see other vids u make so I can say I was here from the start lol"
"Commenting for the algorithm, I&#39;m 5 mins in and fascinated"
Please make more of this
Love this to for your hard work
Really well done video thank you for making this
this is beautiful. an actual work of art. Bravo!
This is amazing! So glad the algorithm brought me here!
Dude. What if speed runs becomes who can design the rewards for a machine learning program the best so that the AI completes the game as fast as possible.
Just another dub W my algorithm took
Holy shit the similarities between the best A.I fighting to be first to finish and sperm fighting to get to the egg is crazy
"I can‚Äôt lose points, if I don‚Äôt end my turn.<br><br>- your AI probably"
I just saw the start of the video and proceed to get cozy because i know this is going to be really good vid
"I never thought anything like this would exist, bravo"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m30s"">4:30</a><br>god forbid a mf take in the vibe"
what a terrible  video. would&#39;ve been cool to  just talk about the ai but your poor comparisons to the human condition made this unbearable
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=8m29s"">8:29</a> refuses to continue XD"
"There&#39;s a lot I can say about this brilliant work of art, but what I&#39;ll leave you with is: someone&#39;s getting an A for their college assignment with this video. Great job! What a brilliant project. If you ever decide to do more I&#39;ll definitely be watching"
can&#39;t wait until somebody will make an AI that manages to beat Dark Souls
Can‚Äôt wait to see this lil guy become a Pok√©mon master!!!!!
I can&#39;t wait for Skynet.
"ive literally never commented but this deserves one, the fact that this is your first video is insane, cant wait for more like this"
Lol 300 days to beat Brock
I beg for a follow up video. It&#39;s wonderful
studied AI in university and this would have been so useful to understand RL! great vid :)
Hi do you have an email or other social media I can contact you at?
How much to train a model to play Worms World Party?
So this took you 5 years YOU DESERVE WAYYYYYY MORE VIEWS
Legitimately great video! I love it!
"thank you youtube algorithm, this was fun to watch"
Peter you are heck of smart
"The counterclockwise motion may just be a result of how certain maps are layed out in the first could areas. You have to go to take the right path on Route 1 to get to Viridian, so following the right wall will get you there.<br><br>Then in Viridian Forest, hugging the right wall is pretty much the fastest way to get through the forest, and I think later generations only deviated slightly to fight trainers for more experience once they realized that Brock was the main roadblock.<br><br>Finally, in Pewter City, you need to take a counterclockwise path to get into the gym. So the AI probably didn&#39;t have a preference at first, but going in a counterclockwise direction for it to where it needed to go there fastest."
"Im having some issues, It says &quot;RuntimeError: Program &#39;ffmpeg&#39; is not found; perhaps install ffmpeg using &#39;apt install ffmpeg&#39;.&quot; ive installed and reisntalled ffmpeg idk how many different ways and nothing is working, can someone help?"
"I have a question, can you train the ai based on games that you have ran and show it the games to speed up training?"
Imagine if the first truly sentient AI is some YouTube wow ai so cool AI that was left running for 32 years
"I was supposed to sleep early today. Damn, that was awesome. Please make a version trying to beat the game!"
"great job. however, you can improve by not calling magikarp junk pokemon."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=8m34s"">8:34</a> the AI rage quit üòÇ"
Wow! Keep making vids like this and your channel will blow up!
"What a video, my man! Congratz, this is awesome stuff. Thank you!"
Very nice! A princely experiment!
"A...legal file of Pokemon red, you say?"
Very cool tech
"Using another emulator than PyBoy might be much more compute efficient and therefore cheaper, even if interfacing will be a bit more tricky."
The AI keeps giving me errors and then new errors after that.
Great Work!
How are the visuals done if I may ask?
Why is a pokemon named AAAAAAAA so funny to me? üòÇüòÇ
"Why does the AI lean towards the &quot;correct path&quot;? For example, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=7m15s"">7:15</a>, you can see that most scenarios the character was going to the right of the entrance rather than left"
"Skynet started as a Pok√©mon trainer. Caught them all, then caught us."
Commentarie for the algorithm
"I&#39;m blown away by the data analysis, incredible!"
Easily the most beautifully presented reinforcement learning video I‚Äôve ever seen. <br>Bravo üëèüëèüëè<br><br>Also providing resources for people to continue this experiment on their own üî•üî•üî•
"i think my rewards would be something like<br><br>movement: each step the AI takes is a 1 point reward<br>interactions: each interaction is a two point reward, this includes each screen of dialogue and each action in battle<br>experience: each point of experience your pokemon earn is a single reward point<br>money: two points of reward for each pokedollar gained, this would include the value of items in the bag<br><br><br>this would hopefully prevent it from getting stuck, because there isn&#39;t really a way to farm lower value rewards that gives it a high score faster than actually making progress"
Before even watching the vid. Can we put the AI through every gen (especially those with VGC battle tower) and see if we can make the strongest auto battler? Lol
I&#39;m totally invested in this in more games
So glad I&#39;m finding this channel now while it&#39;s small. You are going places sir!
May I ask how do you get the visual of all the runs going at the same time. Is that part of this? Im really new to this first time actually and im trying to learn and play with the code a little once I start getting the hang of it. Mind doing another video with a little bit of a tutorial on the basics. I know this probably isnt simple at all.
Marry me
Only 9k subs?!! I must say you have such great editing skills
You&#39;re teaching me about AI through bloody Pok√©monüòÇüòÇüòÇ Well Doneüëè
code bullet but not a shit poster vibes
Wow
"Great video!  Entertaining project, hope to see more!"
Is this only for Mac?
This was super interesting great video!
"For rewarding battles, giving points for damaging the opponent&#39;s Pokemon and reducing points for running might have worked better than using levels as the sole reward point. Still a very interesting thing to see simulations of."
amazing video with great editing and visuals! nice video!
Thats is actually very awesome! Congrats for all your work!
I feel bad for the ai that were traumatized from depositing their pokemon ü•∫ It must have been like killing your own beloved pet.
pls make more videos like this
Version 45 can be considered equal to the training on low level Pokemon strategy. A sub-optimal tactic which takes a period of around a few hours. So I am going to give Version 45 a value of 3 hours in human sub-optimal gameplay. Since I can find a direct comparison in my own experience playing Pokemon which takes that amount of time. I say it is suboptimal because time and time again I have made the mistake. Realizing it is not the best tactic by using direct comparison to other methods of play which yield superior results in the same amount of time.
Crazy cool video.
This is beautiful.
"Could you store what pokemon it has faced and what it knows. <br>So example if it knows it has faced Geodude, it should be able to store that tackle is not effective. So punish it for using tackle if it knows it&#39;s not effective, and reward it for using what is effective."
Can‚Äôt believe this is your first video. This was so entertaining to watch and the editing leaves me wondering how much time it took you. Hope you put out more videos like this and I‚Äôd love to see a full AI playthrough at some point!
"Your analysis may be valid, but, you‚Äôre ignoring the glaring volume of variable that are affecting how your analysis matches to real life lessons. <br><br>Pokemon is about building a strong team of Pok√©mon and optimizing for battles and success through the unknown encounters. <br><br>Nobody spends time maximizing the pokemon levels beyond their 6 pokemon party. Which changes over time too as better pokemon are found. <br><br>This AI has no learning about what it means to have pokemon to play the game with. That‚Äôs the whole game."
"Extremely interesting! I would love to see how it handles Crystal, which is my favorite Pok√©mon game :D or even my game, Dokimon. A little Ai beta tester that could go through and find bugs in all my patch updates would be a dream come true ^^"
"Great video, glad the algorithm sent me this way, easy sub!<br><br>Also would love to see the AI go further"
At some time AI will treat us like battle pets and call us AAAAAAAAAAAA
could i use the AI to play through the gen2 games? i think it would be fun to eventually battle the AI after it beats the game
Can&#39;t wait to see the AI beat the game üòÆ
Thank you for this project!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=3m29s"">3:29</a> lol, the AI turned into one of the NPCs. I was going to say at the beginning when it just started hitting random buttons that &quot;it reminds me of when I was a kid and I first played.&quot;.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=8m28s"">8:28</a> so basically what you&#39;re saying is that it rage quits lol.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=9m24s"">9:24</a> omg, poor ai lol. The thing tried something new and that gave it PTSD."
Multiverse theory visualized
"This is great- I have no background with anything programmingwise but you made this into such an entertaining story. I hope that this blows up enough to get a sequel at some point, I&#39;d watch this for HOURS!"
"Also, instead of reading the screen to find its location, would it be better to read the game state to get its coordinate instead?"
Unbelievable visuals ‚ù§
What a great video!! was not expecting to analyze and question my own human behavior when I clicked on it. the visualizations alone are mind blowing. whole video was so well made and explained! subscribed right away
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=22m25s"">22:25</a> to fix this issue would it help to give it an reward for obtaining items aswell?<br><br>I feel like that would fix the issue of it never backtracking without needing to &quot;hack in&quot; special rewards everything just gotta consider it needs to be a bigger then the reward they could get from exploring"
"Would making reaching certain check points (e.g. entering veridian forest, beating Brock, entering the rock tunnel) as rewards make it progress better? (But then there will be the problem of the AI trying to reach locations as early as possible, leaving it underleveled for battles)"
The visualization is so cool please keep going
The ants in my room when I accidentally drop a crumb:
This is a sick video. Good job man.
"Who&#39;s Al? Pacino, Capone? Nassr maybe?"
"(Makes the program deduct points if the AI loses a battle)<br>The AI: &quot;Fine, I just won&#39;t play anymore.&quot;"
Thanks for this great Content
"Dude, great job! Subscribed and even commented for the algorithm&#39;s sake :)"
"It&#39;s like one of Secret Base&#39;s Dorktown or Fumble Dimension essays, but <b>way</b> nerdier. And I mean that in the best way. I love it. Very well done, my friend."
Why the experiment cost 1000$?
You should train an AI to code Pokemon into video games. That way we can prove it can code in the National Pokedex.
"The reward function is the &#39;human&#39; part of AI. How you define reward and punishment is important, which is a philosophical question."
"Super cool Peter, you expand the boundaries of fun I thought  possible for a pokemon game"
Holy shit this channel is gonna explode. Absolutely excellent video! Keep it up!
So.. will we see the ai beat the elite four??
"This is amazing! Great video editing and program design, please make a Part II completing the game!"
This is so well done! Fantastic work!!
<b>AI accidentally deposits a Pokemon</b><br>AI: &quot;I&#39;m never going to financially recover from this&quot;.
"This is actually really good for the future of speedrunning, we could get AI that can learn glitches by doing something optimal to their terms and acceptions, Mario 64 just got carpetless possible by a human in a speedrun so I can&#39;t wait to see what happens next"
cool vid
When i saw you only 9k subs i gotta say im shocked! This is high-quality even for some bigger channels i watch!
Clean and enlightening visuals and  great explanations.<br><br>I had a quick question about the readme. It means by default training the model can use up to ~100 GB of RAM. Is this VRAM from the GPU or no?
Umm how did the AI deliver the Oak&#39;s parcel?
"Magikarp isnt bad. If you have him out for every single Pokemon in every single trainer fight, and (maybe a few high level Geodudes to take out quickly) youll gain just enough exp to level him up to 20 by Misty if you go all the way to Bill first."
This was the neatest suggested video YouTube‚Äôs given me in a while. Really interesting
Pokemon gen 1 hunger games
"Man, you‚Äôre going places! Fantastic work üéâ"
cant imagine the work into that great video! thanks for your commentating
"&quot;Just hanging out and admiring the scenery, is more rewarding than exploring the rest of the world.&quot; Never have I felt more like a machine learning algorithm than this sentence right here."
"Please make a follow-up documenting changes needed to get the AI to beat the E4. I&#39;d be very interested to see how long it would take it to learn that it has to go back to Viridian to reach the E4, given the reward for novelty."
What an amazing first Video mate. I guess we just witnessed the rise of a new Youtube star!
Awesome job!
This is a great video! Can‚Äôt wait to see this AI tackle Pokemon Gold next. (possibly)
"This is very well done, and quite cool!"
"Subscribed, I really want to see what the AI does next...<br><br>Also I do feel sorry for the ai"
What if God was just one big AI randomly running 7-something-billion lives all at once trying to achieve it&#39;s own reward states. I know when I enter a room I explore it counter-clockwise 9 times out of 10.
"Speaking of algorithms, leaving a comment to help the video reach more people"
extremely interesting video! this is very impressive especially for your first video here!
this video hit all the human needs for drawing in attention and keeping us on the video.. deeper than you know way to understand algorithm&#39;s<br>Your channel is being made thru a perfect algorithm
"Was watching on my TV but came here to comment, the editing is absolutely brilliant!"
This is exactly how I want to learn about AI
woag. i love. computer ‚ò∫‚ò∫
5 years?!
Bros first video got 300k views congrats
Missing No. Has corrupted the Ai Data
+1 for super effective moves might speed things up
Amazing video.... just did anyone else have ocd about the power light not being on o.o
Oh please make the AI beat the Elite four!
More pls
This is how higher beings see our dimension....
The fact that it utilized the games consistency to guarantee a catch is insane. I feel like AI will now be used to explore new speed run routes
Almost kinda poetic that the AI hung out in that one spot in Pallet town because it liked the scenery instead of progressing the game
"The AI seems to only be trained on the input of the game system. I wonder if it is able to train this AI (or another) to understand the text of the game. This would solve that Prof. Oak problem. Let the AI talk to everything it can, and remember the names of the NPCs. When it runs into the PokeMart which says to return the parcel to Prof. Oak, it can establish that this is a task, and look up where Prof. Oak is to complete the task.<br>Also, this would help with battling. Once it can read super effective and not very effective status, it would help it choose how to battle more efficiently."
well this is deserving of a comment to the algorithm gods so good job
wouldnt the Ai have the same problem if it ever reach the final gym as it would have to go back to viridian city if the current implemantation is not changed?
"This brings back so many fond memories of playing Blue version on my pokemon edition GBC, learning how to evolve pokemon for the first time and finally getting through the forest. I&#39;ve played the game so much, 25 years later I can STILL visualize the entire route of Rock Tunnel."
Did you have any experience with video editing or content creation before you created and uploaded this video? This was extremely impressive for a first video and it&#39;s great to see that there&#39;s still some really amazing creative people posting videos on YouTube.
Drop this AI into pokemon into the next generation game and see how well it goes in a brand new environment but applying what it learned
dude u gotta optimize it below 100GB of RAM for training when we can train state of the art AI models on 24 or less lmao.
Did not know you can play pokemon race with 20000 bots XDD
Please collab with Defunctland next.<br><br>AI plays Shapeland
"I‚Äôm curious where this could go with a different approach? For example what if another ai was given the basic knowledge of how to level up, catch pokemon and type match ups but nothing else.<br>Basically the program tells it-(Here‚Äôs the basics you need to know but otherwise your on your own.)- I‚Äôm genuinely curious how fast the ai could progress through the game compared to the one in the video."
Bro is definitely passing his final year
Can we observe this but split the AI with the other two starters?
Super dope üî•
"This work is easily a bachelor of science final project for an engineering degree. Sir, you have my admiration"
"This video is a masterpiece, a very interesting project from the technical point of view, perfectly explainied and with a flawless edition."
"As a psych prof I&#39;m always trying to think of different ways to explain certain concepts and give relatable examples, and this one is perfect!"
This video is fantastic. Great explanations and visual presentation. Also appreciate the git repo. Great job!
Could you add a reward for the screen  text ‚Äúhas been added to the pokedex‚Äù this would encourage catching and evolving pokemon.
I am obscenely invested in this and am going to setup my own. Is there a way we could contribute collectively?
"I swear this had 20x less views when I started watching it a few days ago, good for you"
"It would be interesting to try to &#39;generalize&#39; the AI. Basically, placing it in random parts of the game with a random (but realistic) assortment of Pokemon. I suspect that &quot;Up, left, down, right&quot; is optimal for the start of the game (you start at Pallet town, which is relatively low and to the left) but not at all for the late game (where you are either jumping to different places randomly or you&#39;re moving towards the other side of the map).<br><br>Novelty is an interesting choice. It seems particularly vulnerable to local optimal solutions but it&#39;s also a very natural score - &quot;is this new?&quot; is kind of how we interact with games already. I wonder if 10x&#39;ing your scores for the other interactions while keeping &#39;novel&#39; at the same rate might help. Also, encoding things like &quot;defeated a gym leader&quot; into the game, which a human understands inherently as major milestones, whereas the game may not. This might help with situations where you need to backtrack (since novelty is rewarded ~10% as high as before) while encouraging faster playthroughs (racing to leaders).<br><br>A significant component of gameplay is reading the text and understanding how it should guide you. Introducing an LLM would be interesting, the LLM could produce scores like &quot;are you moving towards the goal&quot;. The main issue there is how slow it would be, I suspect.<br><br>Anyway, awesome video. I&#39;m gonna probably play around with this."
Fantastic video. +1 sub
"This is amazing, thank you"
SO cool man. Your attention to detail is unreal.
Amazing video!
Hi
"Incredible work. Really well presented and you answered all my major questions that I had in mind in the latter part of the video! Such good production value, and you even included the code and a tutorial! I wish all of YouTube was like this."
Incredible watch! Really look forward to any of your future projects!<br>I never thought I would subscribe to such a new channel. Hope your success skyrockets!
The AI getting PTSD from the pokemon center made me laugh more than it probably should have.<br><br>The production quality here is phenomenal! Absolutely excellent work.
"You spent $1000 to watch ai play pokemon, and thanks to you I got to watch it free. Thank you sir."
If this is already how your first video on youtube looks I&#39;m fucking In for more. Insane quality dude. Very interessting.
"These animations are AAA, great Video!"
damn dude what a great video
"I..... How the heck do you make such an awesome video montage?! Seriously, this is crazy"
All these life lessons and reflections... So deep!
it&#39;s sad we have to give robots digital dopanime drugs to get them to do what we want. I would feel bad for them if they weren&#39;t robots
"For the past 25 years, i have ALWAYS bought that 500p magikarp. And then taken him to the daycare guy south of Cerulean City. Every single time i play the game since i was 12 years old mate"
"I love the map you made, musta been a pain to put all the iterations on it though"
"To reduce the problem of the AI refusing to fight a difficult opponent, maybe make it so that if it loses a battle against a given NPC multiple times, it loses less points on subsequent failures, and when the AI wins against that NPC, it gets all the &#39;lost&#39; points from that NPC back?"
@CodeBullet
Wow incredible. Thank you for freely giving the code.
incredible video. Rarely do you see anything as professional and interesting as this.
very cool vid!
magikarp is not completely useless. it becomes gyrados.
lol the minute you explained the first reward i was like that must have been really hard to tweak to get it to work right.
"I&#39;m thinking that the AI could learn to fight more efficiently faster if we allow the battle reward to be affected by how much HP has been lost throughout the battle, and how fast the battle was completed. <br><br>As for the backtracking issue, yeah that&#39;s complicated. The best I can think of without using situation-specific goals is to reward the AI for discovering new pieces of dialogs. This would allow the AI to understand that some progress has been made when discovering new Professor Oak dialogue, but the AI would also start examining every single interactable decoration. The AI would also need to accidentally backtrack all the way as well, which is unlikely since the AI would see no reward at all while backtracking, and grinding up in levels is surely going to seem more valuable for a long while than getting just a little bit of extra dialogue. And of course that&#39;d be even worse in late game when the AI would need to backtrack to some random place while the whole world is available.<br><br>Another solution I could think of is to give a new type of input to the AI, being to &quot;pathfind&quot; to a location it has already visited. But I&#39;m sure its implementation would be extremely difficult."
W school project
You&#39;re a nerd and this shit is cool.
"We do not stop until this AI gets a no glitch world record! <br><br>always been wary of an AI overlord, but if it can complete Pokemon i could be OK with it."
This becomes absolutely unwatchable due to YT&#39;s aggressive ad policy. 2 15-30 sec unskippable ads every 4ish minutes is ridiculous. I don&#39;t mind watching some to support the creators but YT is pushing it way beyond normal boundaries.<br><br>Absolutely great content however.
&quot;Instead we&#39;re going to use this as a stopping point&quot; üò≠
I would  like to see more videos like this. I really enjoy watching videos on AI learning
"Jeez, what is up with all these crazy good RL videos on YouTube recently??? Great job with the implementation and the editing work!"
Make one for the Dragon Warrior Monsters games for GBC
"I have problems with my working memory. Navigating dungeons like mount moon has always been difficult. <br><br>Eventually I learned to always follow the left wall, I&#39;d eventually get out."
"Can you use it with other games, or just Red and Blue?"
TIL AI names its trainer the same as I did my first playthrough when I was 5 xD
Thank you. This is truely amazing
Program an AI to write the reinforcement algorithm with the goal of beating the game and see how fast Skynet enslaves the human race
Super fascinating. Could you please make another video where you&#39;ve trained the AI to play through the entire game from the start all the way until beating the E4 or maybe even catching all the Pokemon. Keep making videos.
"For some reason, the opening sequence reminds me of Tower Defense."
I‚Äôd imagine the safari zone surf hm would be a big hurdle to get over. Unless you have some kind of reward for getting tms or hms
Ai is like getting thrown to the wolves what if u could teach it
"It‚Äôs truly incredible that it figured out rng manipulation on its own. This is crazy, and I would love to see the full game be completed one day. Your editing and visual aids were perfect."
"This video is very intriguing! I view the different versions of AI isimilar to how players will tackle playing the game (minus the random inputs). It&#39;s highly interesting of how you went about in coding all this, also neat editing too!"
Great first video. This is stellar stuff - a clear explanation of a very complex topic presented beautifully. Just cloned your repo :)
"Was really hoping to see the AI beat the game. Not because of the success, but to critique it‚Äôs final team at the elite four."
The future is now old man!
"This video is GREAT. Really clean, great polish, and full of content. I was SURPRISED when I found out I was 20 minutes in; your content was so interesting it felt like you‚Äôve only just begun!<br><br>Excited for future possibilities - including an extended run, and taking the knowledge from Generation 1 to further generations of Pokemon!"
"What a cool project! Really appreciate your work, keep it up ;D But one question, I don&#39;t know if you mentioned it but how long did you train the model irl?"
"The parallels you mentioned with how humans are like (the pallet town distractions) were so nice, this is some high quality you&#39;re making, keep it up!"
Amazing presentation! Great job simplifying the video for people not in the space. I would love to see a video that get the ai to beat the game
"This was super trippy to watch having been so young when I first played Pok√©mon red. I remember getting stuck in the same places, being intrigued by the water in palette town, and not understanding the benefit on backtracking from viridian city."
"You should reward the AI for everyone that AI helps other AIs to make achievements, it‚Äôll fasten the process."
Imagine all the hidden shinies!!!
Incredible video man. Geez.
Great vid one the better ai vids ive seen
"Hey Peter, once the AI is able to remember and figure out the entire game, would pvp be possible in the future or is that just a dream for people who want to try the game with an AI"
"I wasn&#39;t paying so much visual attention, because I was playing some pokemon Uranium at the time, so I&#39;m not sure if your more in-depth reward system included these, but if not, they might be useful options: total money earned and average stats of all party pokemon. The money part would encourage the AI to seek out trainer battles if it could win them, and specifically more difficult ones. Total experience earned might have a similar effect. Average stats would encourage the AI to get and train better pokemon, and could be weighted to put more or less emphasis on statistical outliers and to prefer having more pokemon and to have them all in consideration. That way, it wouldn&#39;t prefer to just train up a single mon. For example, if it has 5 pokemon, and wartortle is, say, level 20, while the other 4 are all level 10, it would see that it&#39;s only getting the averages of 4 mons&#39; stats. Buying the magikarp wouldn&#39;t change that, and leveling up the wartortle also wouldn&#39;t. <br><br>It&#39;s interesting how the AI had to have its reward system altered to avoid negative reinforcement. You essentially made positive feedback more important than an equal amount of negative feedback. In other situations, though, you&#39;d need to do the opposite. This parallels human instincts. In some cases, negative consequences are made more important, creating panic and phobias, and even causing some of the issues, for example, that I experience with my ADHD. In other cases, positive feedback is prioritized, resulting in skinner boxes and gambling problems. Of course, both of those instances have their evolutionary benefits that just don&#39;t matter so much in modern society. In the wild, if you discover a way to get a useful amount of food, you need to learn it fast and hard, even if it might not always work. If a thousand individuals consistently take that chance, the gene will consistently get passed on, even if it sometimes falls flat. But the genes for avoiding that chance will, at best, not be selected in favor of. On the other hand, if any shadow could be a predator or competitor, you&#39;re incentivized to panic and jump away from them. <br><br>Basically, this kind of AI is practically built to love skinner boxes."

This video is so cool! I can‚Äôt wait to watch it again with my fianc√© later!! ‚ù§
"It depositing a pokemon and freaking out to the point it avoids pokecenters is what I imagine happens to a small kid who loves going swimming, but forgets sunscreen one time and gets a really bad sunburn and then swears to never swim again."
I usually don&#39;t comment on videos but damn this video was so cool and captivating. I loved it!
"please make a video about getting the ai to complete the game. what would be truly amazing is if you can get the ai to not only finish the game, but also to speedrun it."
Could this be reduced to pokemon stadium + shops.  This seems like monumental complexity by random decision searching of an open world.
amazing video. unfortunately can&#39;t seem to get it up and running on my system. but thank you for sharing this!
"this project makes me believe in simulation theory. If we&#39;re teaching an ai to do this, why not expect another intelligence to do the exact same thing but millions of years in the future with technology we&#39;re not even aware of yet? we might be the equivalent of this Pok√©mon ai to something we can&#39;t even perceive"
Some of the files in the repo are two years old. Way to stick with it. This was a fascinating watch.
Finally a good reason to start studying AI-programming :) Thanks a lot for sharing your experience :)
Today I learned that an AI and I share exploration strategies - follow the edge!
Incredibile quality! Congrats
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=7m12s"">7:12</a> Damn, i need a live wallpaper of this!"
I‚Äôm so glad I found this video. One of the highest quality videos I‚Äôve ever seen. I don‚Äôt think I can fully appreciate the work that went into this video but well done. So informative and so well presented
"I love the conclusions you come to and the way you apply them to your solutions, novel and pragmatic. üíØüíØüíØ"
Congratulations
You came here for the AI playing Pokemon but you stayed because the AI is really our baby and we want it to grow into a big and strong productive member of society.
Its okay Ai I cant get through Mt. Moon either üòÖ
"You should have a reward system based on using ‚Äúsupper effective‚Äù, ‚Äúnot very effective‚Äù, etc moves"
here before 100k
Roughly what amount of memory/core power does it take to run parallels of the program for extended periods? Is it on the level of a standard gaming CPU/high end GPU or 64-core processor and Titan?
"Excellent project and video explaining it, nice job!"
"I always wanted to do something similar, however I never had the knowledge to implement something like this. Thanks for the entertaining insightful video"
Awesome
this is badass. we need more AI youtube channels thanks bro
Adding a reward for each new entry in the Pokedex could be helpful for its exploration or each new route entered.
I&#39;d love to see you do a whole game run-through of this.
Holy shit this is your first video?! Damn man!
"insightful, original and strong AI"
Im a human rights attorney with curiosity in ai. This has been very well presented. Thank you for producing and sharing.
Brilliant! ‚Ä¶ Now do Link‚Äôs awakening
I wonder how it&#39;s strats would change if it got rewarded for adding to the dex? Would probably need to find some way to encourage it to switch out pokemon from the pc.
The randomness reminds me of TPP back in 2016!
Brute force. Thats all this is.
Ughhh... I need to know what pokemon it beats the game with! üòÇüòÇ
That long area at the bottom of route 22... I remember being a kid when this game came out and this same thing happening to me nearly; I&#39;d keep jumping the cliff by accident and &quot;spend a disproportionate amount of time there&quot;.
Looks like 8-Bit Agent Smith spreading in the 8-Bit Matrix ‚ò†üòÇ
Incredible that this was your first video. Very well done and I&#39;m excited to see more. -- Maybe even a live stream at some point?
doing autistic shit like this is raw masculinity
This is insane!
Was this video made to help yourself learn the subject better? I know it helps me that teach everybody about whatever it is that I am cutently figuring out. :-) anway amazing video mate. I hope to see more if you want to provide more.
man AI speedruns are gonna be crazy
Wicked cool! Optimize party types?! Beat the Elite Four!
"this is something else, thank you."
Great editing dude üòÆüëç
What I got : Deep look into the human mind based on how we explore and learn about our surroundings.<br><br>What I was hoping to get : Haha funny AI play game!<br><br>still cool though :D
The visuals in the video are amazing!
I love how you compare the algorithm to human behavior
"It&#39;s interesting how little urgency the model has in progressing through the game. I wonder if that would have been better or worse if it had even a basic memory, or was rewarded based on how quickly it hit certain objectives (for example gym badges, pokemon levels, etc). Even if all that changed was that it was rewarded more for leveling faster, I&#39;d bet it eventually finds its way to better grass areas and fights more trainers. Maybe it could be rewarded for gaining money as well (to encourage trainer battles, possibly also selling items).<br><br>Great video! Not many videos on AI are so well put together."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=16m12s"">16:12</a> to be fare, I could never make it through mt. Moon either. That place confused me a lot as a kid and even today!"
"This is legit a really well made video. It&#39;s not only scientific, but really grasping and entertaining."
man this is awesome would defo watch more of its progression :)
Im in the intro and i am amazed by the editing.
"The ai found sitting by some water and looking at flowers more rewarding then going out into the unknown world, there&#39;s something strangely relatable about that, i too would rather look at a nice view then go off into some strange new place i know nothing about"
Awesome video and generally amazing job. The visuals were great and the explanations given were technical but not that much to make the video boring. I would love to see how the pretrained model could be used to play other pokemon games like emerald or even the newer fire red/leaf green.
Ai learning is like Naruto&#39;s multi shadow clone jutsu
"This is great. Whenever someone asks me if consciousness exists, I will point them to this video."
Thanks for this fantastic video!!
AI shows more appreciation to games than 99.9% of short attention span players nowadays.
such a great video
"This is one of those ideas I&#39;ve had kicking around in my head but never got around to actually doing.<br><br>I assumed you&#39;d have to explicitly tell it where its next objective is in the world. Never thought of just rewarding it for finding new areas, and especially surprised it worked so well. Backtracking is a big problem though.<br><br>The main thing I&#39;d do differently is having one agent handle navigating the world, and another one handle battles. I&#39;m curious how that would affect its ability to plan ahead; would it learn to run from battles if it&#39;s deep in a cave and running low on supplies?<br><br>I&#39;m not sure why you used total levels instead of total EXP? It looks like you had that implemented.<br><br>It could be optimized a lot by &quot;cheating&quot; and reading the coordinates and game state instead of looking at the screen. Maybe that would be too far from the spirit of the project though."
Please upload a full video of the AI doing a full run please
"Wow... cant wait to see more from you. Entertaining, inspiring, and educational. This is what YouTube was made for."
The pokemon center bit blew my mind!!
"Funny that the ai could get stuck so easy, it would be interesting how fast it could beat brook, as kind of a speedrun"
"Amazing video, mate."
"AI: deposits Pok√©mon, -12 points. AI: üò∞"
I wonder if any of the Reds could find a glitch that raises the level of a Pok√©mon up to 100 in an instant.
"I was kinda expecting you to add a minor reward for super effective and ineffective attacks, to let the AI learn there are differences between different attacks against different enemies. Same with enemies hitting on you, although I can understand finding the variables and conditions make not be very good, but maybe it would have been easier to detect both hp and make rewards based on those along with the number of turns of the battle."
i was more impressed with the video editing
You never explained why Squirtle was always picked
"Awesome content, great job with the editing and format of the video. I really like the techy stuff, but I appreciate that you left it to the end to keep others interested."
"Fenomenal work, kinda inspiring me to start learning ML!"
Interesting and well made video üòä
This video was incredibly entertaining.<br><br>Thank you for the upload
This is the coolest video I have ever seen! You did beautiful job visualising all the games being played simultaneously.
who remembers Twitch plays pokemon?
"&quot;An room filled with monkeys with type writers, given infinite time, could write all of Shakespeare works&quot;"
Magikarp is goated
"The man sold 5 million pok√©dollars worth of magikarp to AI, his business is BOOMING!"
Ahh I remember the days I used to try and ko geodude with gust
"For a first ever vid, this was immaculate my guy. Glad the algorithm showed me this"
"Just start8ng Mt Moon, all I wanna know: Helix or Dome?"
Now take the model and drop it into another gen
"really cool idea and execution, any chance you&#39;d be interested in making a very small scale &quot;pokemon engine&quot; where you train an AI with a small sample of competitive teams maybe"
inb4 nintendo sees this
This is very helpful for someone like me that wanted to learn more about AI but only has few bytes of brain! I love pokemon..
THIS is How You Work With Ai!!!
"This is awesome man, I&#39;m here for future videos"
Very cool video my dude
Hey man loved the video! Would love if this channel became a IA-videogame thing.
Looking forward to part 2! :)
Bro dont try to relate this to human psychology. Just play your damn Pok√©mon game üòÇüòÇ
"Everything about this was amazing, the computational approach, the video edit, the tone, the explanations and the real life parallels. Beautiful work!"
Wouldnt be suprised if in 5-10 years a trained AI will improve the TAS world record.
"I&#39;m listening to the AI training model, and admittedly I kept getting bothered by something arguably not within the scope of this experiment. I get that the experiment was more about figuring out everything from next to nothing and us trying to figure out how to &#39;communicate&#39; with it the right balance of rewards that help it succeed, but I still feel like if we want it to develop in a more human-like way, it needs to understand given goals and quests. I keep thinking how, while it would be more effort or more involved, if it had a reward system in place for learning a new goal or quest (i.e. to &#39;travel&#39; somewhere and either register it as a new location or a previous one, remembering its quest when it arrives and starts trying to complete it), as well as helping it understand unique mechanics of the game. If it got a bonus for each time it learned a type weakness and used it appropriately (with a cap to prevent farming that reward), each time it learned what a move did so it could be more strategic, and so on, i wonder just how much it could do then. Would that be as useful in other scenarios? No, the specificity would hinder its application elsewhere, but since this was being trained for pokemon in the first place, i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s really an issue... sorry, I&#39;m rambling."
Its still smarter than me tbf
Very good.
"The AI getting stuck might be fixed with a reward function similar to this: Reward = ABS( Current_Position[X,Y] - Position_1000_Frames_Prior[X,Y])"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=12m56s"">12:56</a> it looks pretty much like a mod for factorio :D"
It entered viridian forest. That means it got the pokedex. How did it figure that out??
"Just 10 minutes in, and it has already gotten so damn interesting! The behaviors, the systems, the events, the unexpected but explainable scenarios, the AI literally experiencing something comparable to trauma? I want to see more!"
Imagine walking outside and seeing a thousand robotic versions of the same 11 year old swarming the area like bees
I&#39;m curious as to if you were to have the AI analyze all the top 10 speedruns with the info you have for this data if the AI would be able to figure out a more efficient or faster speed run
Really looking forward to more content from this channel ‚ù§
why&#39;s the quality so high for this channels first video
"Would it not be better to simple encode some of the memory rather than use images, most pokemon games are tile/grid based and could be encoded down to include some history and some basic info like move types and pokemon types in battle in far less bytes than is needed for a useful image.<br>This would also allow for far better rewards using unique screens and ever distance for exploration and using stat increases instead of level (this would encourage them to evolve), this might also tempt them to use items that would otherwise not be useful (although you would have to make sure to exclude the temp effects of x-items).<br>I feel using images is not going to help the AI play other non-gen 1/2 games and would not help it learn other non-pokemon games, on the other hand if you started looking at the encoding for the later game and include the gen of the game in the input (to give it hope of leaning things like gen 1 misses) you should be able to come up with a common representation that works for a lot of the games and would give it a good chance of playing a good amount of them.<br>Additionally if you included main story progress as part of the reward and gave it a large bonus it might given enough time learn the required back tracking to complete a game but thats not all that likely."
"omg, one of the best videos i have seen ! üéâ"
"Does it also work on Windows? (Running it)<br>And if yes, could u make a tutorial"
Imagine chilling in the woods watching caterpillars when an army of 10 year olds wander past.
Thanks for the ending bit. I hope you continue to show how to setup the environment for reproduction!
Now do Skyrim
"the ai getting traumatized and never going back to the pokemon center üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠<br><br>what an amazing and well made video!! you can feel all the effort and love put into it, hope more people can see this brilliant piece of work üíõ"
"This is one of the best video on reinforcement learning, giving a great and entertaining overview without going too much into the details, while still being a complete introduction to the field of RL.<br>Do you think it would be possible to make an agent train faster using the hindsight goal relabeling? That is, making the agent explore, terminate on a game state, and then having the AI learn to reach this goal with greater probability by restarting it from scratch and conditioning it on the goal. Also, with the same technique you used for curiosity, you could be sure to keep a list of very different and novel goals in order to make sure you always push the agent deeper into the game.<br>My intuition is that the agent would have an easier time learning to reach game states it already reached by chance before, but would still have to master the game mechanics (winning battles, leveling up...) in order to reach the more long term goals efficiently. I imagine it would require less reward tuning since there would only be one reward (goal reached or not)."
"If this thing picks the Helix fossil it needs to be rewarded, and subsequently purged. Because it&#39;s learning TOO much"
"I didn&#39;t come to a Pokemon/AI video to learn something about myself, but here we are.<br>(This video is amazing, I am not mad)"
This is a really well done video
wow i can not believe this is your only video it is so good!!
The fact that you explained how you made the video... In such detail..<br>Holy shit dude.. Just excellent<br>I dunno what else to say lol
"This was great, the AI development process actively shows a lot of the issues that Rob Miles discusses in his videos on AI such as unintended consequences."
"Good video! But, why was the junk food part in there? It‚Äôs obvious that it would take Magikarp, it‚Äôs just a numerical thing. Losing money isn‚Äôt negative, so why not get a big reward for ‚Äûfree‚Äú? It doesn‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs a ‚ÄûJunk Pok√©mon‚Äú. There is no negative association, and worst case it can just store it away, still a very positive outcome. So it‚Äòs pointless to mention it. Was it really just about the AI? I mean some other people smoke too and that‚Äôs not survival‚Ä¶ but if they want to do it, oh well. Can‚Äôt stop them. If this is about living healthy and survival ‚Ä¶"
Yeesh 9 hours ago he got 4.15k now he got 7.25k subs wish you hit 1m soon
I have been meaning to learn the implementation of RL. This video with its high as hell production has given me motivation to start it. I hope one day i will be able to build an AI to not just play old 2d games but the AAA titles being released today.
The pkmn center ptsd was hilariousüòÇüòÇ
This is amazing. The visualisations youve made are extremely impressive
"Awesome video man! Nice work, your analysis was great, had me hooked...how much compute you using?"
"The real AI is the yt algorithm that brought people here.<br><br>Good job though, the reward system is quite good."
great video
&gt;gets bored in mt moon<br>just like zoomers that try our old games
see such excellent presentation
Amazing! Great video
Where did he get these maps?
woa
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m00s"">4:00</a> Maybe we could all learn something from just hanging out and admiring the scenery."
Low key learned how to read playing Pok√©mon emerald I can relate to the ai ahaha
define &quot;a lot of memory&quot;
Wow great way to start my day. Thanks for posting
"Wow I was really shocked to see how long it took the AI to learn the most basic mechanics of the game but the one screen where it had managed to get a Blastoise before finding out how to get through Mt. Moon, I was very much like: well done, AI, I‚Äòm so proud of you."
were all the other past videos deleted? i remember there were more
Looking forward to seeing more content from you!
"How about decreasing the reward by 1 each move. And then increasing the reward for healing pokemon, catching unqiue pokemon based on whats in the inventory and PC, rewards for winning trainer battles. That way it is incentivised to look for new pokemon to catch and battle trainers without the need to compare past screens all the time, and when it walks around aimlessly or stops moving it gets a reward penalty and is incentivised to go to new areas"
"Very nice work - DRL is tough! Compute costs are huge, it&#39;s hard to optimise resource usage, the train data is a moving target (as is the target function), training dynamics of the network alone are a nightmare (and it updates at a glacial pace), exploration is another nightmare...."
"Guys, this is his first video and its this good. He needs more subscribers. Agreed?"
Criminally underrated video. This needs to have a billion views and likes. I‚Äôd love this to be a series and see you get the AI to defeat the champion eventually
"You have just given an artificial intelligence PTSD. You are a monster.<br>...Yeah, that&#39;s a sentence."
The hundreds of player characters all swarming around like flies was strangely unnerving
"Regarding the exploration reward, is it not setting yourself up for hardship by using something with a costly time-complexity? Specifically - the more areas it sees, the more screens it has to test against. And the further it goes, the more screens it has to test. This is O(n^2) (with each test being O(n). Uncertain whether &quot;each screen&quot; means each screen sufficiently new, or each screen that had <i>any</i> difference, but if it is the latter then the animations will vastly increase the problem-set.<br><br>I think a better way to do exploration, would be to calculate position. Though that would be difficult and if you did it by simulating a game by its inputs makes it unable to learn on anything else without similarly updating that &quot;map&quot;. You could try to have program that looks at player-animations to determine when it moves and where, but this would take some effort (implement or train a recognizer), and be likely to break if the ai manages to bug the game (although maybe having a reward function effectively disable if game bugs in a certain way might be desired, as a way to penalize some bugs).<br>The main issue however is if the ai manages to break out of bounds (which is known to be possible in this game), as then that just makes this reward <i>really</i> promote simply moving in a single direction. Arguably even worse however, is that this makes exploration only exist within overworld - not battles etc.<br><br>As such, you would want to add another reward/penalty - Checking screen-difference like before, but much more limited (the issue is potential performance, so &quot;forgetting&quot; <b>is</b> a solution). The ai could remember the last few screens (should that be 1? 4 (number of directions player can face)? prolly much more to cover battles and ui?) and each time an input continues chaining one of those screens (maybe additional weight for exact same screen as before input). Then either do the explore reward on that like before, or have it start penalizing whenever things start repeating too much (unsure which approach is best. Maybe even both at once?). If you use a penalty, this should make going out of bounds become heavily penalized as nothing ever changes visually. Same for getting stuck somewhere (like before e4) or long tunnels (That last one is the only issue. Underground road will be very disliked by the AI with such a penalty - but tbf humans also quickly got bored when walking in it). However, the regular positional exploration reward should counteract it slightly for the tunnels (extending their allowed length by a little bit).<br><br>One could argue that is an issue, but since you liked analogs to humans then this can be considered <i>boredom.</i> And humans do indeed get bored when moving out of bounds, or think a repeating segment has been intentionally made infinite (or &quot;too long&quot;).<br><br><br>In short:<br>- add a reward for new cartesian <b>positions</b> in the world (helps in longer tunnels; counteracts the next bulletpoint potentially making it backtrack <i>too</i> much from poor memory).<br>- Prolly keep the curiosity, but limit its size (&quot;forgetfulness&quot;. for performance in large maps) for future performance and backtracking.<br>- Consider adding a penalty for &quot;boredom&quot; (either when curiosity hasn&#39;t triggered in a while, or when a very small set of screens keep on getting repeated. Or both, to different strengths). Maybe also tie it to &quot;positional curiosity&quot; as well, so backtracking too much gets penalized.<br><br>The reason positional curiosity - despite having same complexity - should be ok when image-diff&#39;s aren&#39;t, is because it is both a much cheaper operation to compare (O(1) vs O(w*h)) and cheaper in memory, but most important of all, easy to add optimization strategies to such as Spatial Indexing or cheaply hash if using ie. a hashmap. But sure, setting <i>some</i> max limit might still be worth it, as infinite maps can get painful otherwise.<br><br><br>Next, Would be interesting to have sound cues added to the ai. Like how that could make it emerge a behaviour where low-health sounds trigger something, or &quot;puzzle opened something elsewhere&quot; tunes like in zelda. Additionally could also be added to curiosity rewarding (new sounds = good) so entering new biomes makes the BGM reward the ai.<br><br>Regarding battling, I think rewarding only winning might be a bit too strict (evidently not, as it learned to fight). Might be worth adding rewards for defeating trainers pokemon, or even tied to health or pokemon count (perhaps only checked once a battle concludes, as that is the only time when that state truly matters for the future)? I would however ague that it&#39;s best to either only reward <i>first</i> time you defeat a trainers mon, as otherwise it runs the risk of finding a grinding spot where it defeats a couple mons, intentionally blackouts, and repeat, or to disconnect a portion of the ai pre-trained (or not) to only care about battles and reward only that sub-ai module (so any rewards applied to it does not affect overworld decisions, but does impact decisions during battle. I think you might have mentioned this kind of compartmentalization at the end?). Either way, these rewards would only serve to improve the speed at which it gets better, but the exploration and winning rewards (and a blackout penalty) would eventually be enough to make it battle to come out as unscathed as possible anyway.<br>Main benefit is how such a submodule can be trained by itself on a simplified program, and carried over between iterations of the pokemon AI (and it &#39;only&#39; needs to learn to ask/listen to that module for what to do during battles).<br><br>One last interesting thing you could try, is to <i>train</i> the reward/penalty functions themselves. Either directly using the functions themselves to score things, or by involving yourself where a state is shown to the ai, it scores it, and then the human scores it. And it&#39;s penalized based on the error.<br>This is obviously going to result in flawed reward-functions, as it will misunderstand what is of importance. But might end up <i>interesting,</i> even if bad. Main issue however is that it will be very tedious to train something that way."
Does the AI have an Idea about the past? Or does it calculate from a fresh state evertime it made a move?
Peter that was a fascinating and well put together video.  Peter you have done good :) <b>bonus: props for making the repo so people can build upon your existing work</b>
subsribed just from the fact that the video is super detailed and you can see a lot of effort as gone in to this
Amazing video!! üéâ
Love this video and would love to see more!
Let&#39;s play videos are gonna be üî•üî•
"Impressive, I hope you&#39;ll make more video in the future."
"You should continue on this video, make it get all badges and even the elite four and go over all the tweaks you had to add to get there. Very interesting video for sure"
"You spent $1000 dollars to make this video?! Incredible commitment, and incredible video. Loved it. Thank you!"
It was funny that the AI accidentally deposited its pokemon and suffered a huge penalty. It reminded me of Twitch Plays Pokemon where the PC was an enormous risk and to be avoided at all costs unless absolutely necessary.
This has got to be one of the best videos I‚Äôve ever watched on YouTube. Brilliant from start to finish.
I don&#39;t remember the last time I enjoyed a YouTube video this much!
4 minutes in and this is one of the most well put together videos I have ever seen online. Great job! You gained a new subscriber
"you know how ai could have finished pokemon faster? let it play sun/moon. that game plays itself, its so easy ai can finish on the first attemt im sure"
How to get past the boring repetitive tunnel: give a very small reward to the AI each time it increases the maximum distance it has ever traveled in a particular direction.
Clearly want a follow up on this.
Keep an eye on this one YouTube we‚Äôve got our next generation of code bullet
The production value is insane! I&#39;d love to see a series where the AI goes all the way to Elite 4!
"This video is a piece of art, both in technical terms regarding AI, and visually pleasing to watch"
Wow! This was such a good learning video! Thanks for all the work and the presentation! :)
theres something hilarious about it not being able to leave mt moon
"This was unreal, nice work man. I hope you can continue to refine it üëç"
"There we have it, the ultimate proof that going to Mc Donalds is NPC behaviour!"
"Hang on, why did a vast majority turn right when getting into Viridian forest?"
Great video! What editing software did you use? This is top notch!
We should make an A.I. in real life and give it the goal to become a billionaire. Perhaps it somehow finds exploits in our own reality.
"Fascinating stuff. Two things I considered. 1, reward function from screen exploration is interesting. What if you tried rewarding the ai when it sees a new piece of text? Maybe that would encourage it to progress through the game and speak to more npcs, acting less like a speed runner and more like a human player.<br><br>2, this can have adverse effects but can you have the ai learn from watching the inputs a human player puts in? Less repeatable but you can learn something from it I&#39;m sure."
I can&#39;t wait for the day when people can&#39;t tell the difference between a legitimate playthrough and something that will likely be shoving rods up our a*** in a couple decades.
Bro spent 1k for this video to be possible. That&#39;s dedication.
"Ok you&#39;re gonna reach millions of subs very easily, you have an incredible knowledge on computer science/programming  AND video editing. Both the content and the visuals are amazing, i don&#39;t how you managed to do those multisprite/screens records but damn boy, you&#39;ll go far in life"
"This is just brilliant dude! Best video youtube has suggested  to me after a long time after the other video where someone plays Pokemon blind and deaf. It&#39;s always a great learning experiment to use computers to solve what are essentially mazes created by humans.<br>But what I would love to see AI try to play Pokemon VGC competitively. Designing a team, choosing abilities, items, EVs, and moves, optimizing the best team and then strategize in battle against an opposing team like  a pokemon world champion would be absolutely amazing to do."
"Learning about how AI would go through with beating Pokemon and accompanying that with amazing edited made for an excellent video, great job!üéâ"
not a logarithmic scale
Jon Bois esque
Your video is awesome!
"I&#39;d love to understand the jupyter playbook better, as well as how training the model works. I&#39;m doing my best to understand it but a few documented  pointed would be amazingly helpful."
Great video and interesting content
Very interesting video. My conclusion before the video started is that the ai was just gunna get on a loop of running away from battles as that is the most efficient way to move through the game. Sorta right but I didn‚Äôt know that you could instruct these semi complex instructions and the way to instruct the ai to progress areas is interesting. Just made me wonder what makes how a human learns to how this bot is learning so different. Like we don‚Äôt need these million iterations. And we easily tell if we are progressing In a game and make our own objectives. Suppose we have a better frame of reference compared to the ai and get identify what things in an image actually are way better
"imagine being in the Pokemon World when this happens, 40 children pour into your quiet town and start moving in a seemingly random fashion. Eventually, most of them end up with a badge and slowly make their way out of town by what must seem like pure luck."
The rat at the end&#39;s name
Always buy the Magikarp üê†<br><br>Ed: This is completely awesome and I‚Äôm totally having a go (but with Pokemon blue)
"This is an extremely well made video, so interesting and the way you explained it keeps you engaged, I hope your channel blows up. Good luck!"
Pls train more AIs on other games and upload them :P
what a cool video to illustrate very real human problems and how interesting that they&#39;re similar to ai in many ways üëç
"This is awesome. Ai is awesome. You legit coded a brain. Simpler than a human brain, but a brain nonetheless"
"Really really cool, hope to see more!"
Good video
"If you ever somehow got the impression that people &quot;sign out&quot; when you explained something &quot;complicated&quot;, know it&#39;s not because it&#39;s &quot;complicated&quot; but instead it&#39;s because <b>your explanation</b> is overly complicated - and it makes you come off as a condescending prick."
My god the editing. It&#39;s so beautiful.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=26m07s"">26:07</a> How can I view memory address(information on right side) ?<br>I visited same file in github but couldn‚Äôt find it"
This game has been played how many times by the populace since 1996? And the AI probably quadrupled that in a matter of months.
"Really fantastic video, learned a lot !!!"
This is super cool and interesting! Please more of other gens if possible üòä
Bro...here I was subconsciously being proud of myself for downloading an emulator &amp; pokemon red as a freshman &amp; then you drop this on me??ü§Øü´°
"WoW, I thought this would just be a &quot;look at this&quot; video, but after 4 and a half minutes it already presented an interesting relationship to real life. Now I&#39;m hooked for the rest of the video"
"I&#39;ve wondered for a long time if there would be a way of making a Twitch Plays Pokemon, but instead of the chat spamming inputs, the chat gets to reward the AI as part of its reinforcement learning.<br><br>There was also a recent demonstration of pok√©mon population simulation based on their rock-paper-scissor typings. I&#39;ve wanted to learn how to do it with rules from the Game Of Life about how many neighbors a tile must have of particular typings."
Incredible video! Thanks for the effort.
Is the AI smarter than twitch? Research says yes
I&#39;m wondering how it talked to Nurse Joy. Did it mash A and then switched to mashing B like a human would? Did it talk to everyone? I guess it would trigger the exploration reward.
Its not an AI
I really wish you would tell me how you solved all of the problems you faced.///
That aint red...............
"this is great, I&#39;m subscribing"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=9m30s"">9:30</a> <br>could you imagine just playing pokemon, and then using the pc and your being is flooded with pain multiple times greater than you had ever experienced before"
10/10 video
"wait , did the ai learn that squirtle is the best choice?"
"I definitely feel like updating its processes to help it keep exploring further into the cave would be worthwhile. It would take a long time, but seeing how far it can go would be interesting.<br>My first basic thought would be that if the AI ever finds itself stuck in a location that isn&#39;t updating its pixels, have it try to locate a wall to follow. This should always give it a chance to find a new tile set. <br>Or increasing the AI&#39;s F.O.V so it can see more of the screen that is normally allowed would give it a chance to see stuff it normally wouldn&#39;t be able to, thus giving more tiles to update itself with. The issue would then become, how do you prevent it walking into a deadend and remaining there."
when u deposit the lvl 13 pokemon and go through a traumatic experience
"If this is AI learning now, imagine the future üò≥"
This is the AI Version of Twitch Plays Pok√©mon. And does a way better job üòÇ
this is actually super interesting
you&#39;re really underrated!
"Honestly instantly subb disappointed this is the only video, u ferl pike a seasoned youtuber"
Awesome
"That first point is really fascinating, right around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m00s"">4:00</a> where it&#39;s just wandering around that one area in Pallet Town. I say this because this was me as a kid in the little area. Even just watching it walk around there fills me with so much nostalgia. You wonder the whole game until you get surf what is in that water. It&#39;s the first place I went when I got surf. There&#39;s no problems in that little area. It&#39;s the most peaceful place in the game most likely."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=17m15s"">17:15</a> literally my strat for mazes lol"
Wonderful video! I&#39;ll definitely stay tuned in for any future projects!
It&#39;s like watching ants trying to figure out a maze/puzzle
AI or water
Yooo this is so good. I‚Äôm a seasoned python developer but haven‚Äôt tried my hand at training AIs to play games I should really look into it.
"reward new screens, items found that dont decrease the money count, restoring health outside of battle and removing status conditions, leveling, and winning. punish losing, and losing without healing after a win."
I would love to see what this AI does once it finally gets fly
"Could it be possible to give it a list of goals? The game gives the player a series of implied goals like &quot;Beat the gym&quot; or &quot;Bring NPC water&quot;. The AI can&#39;t understand the implied goals like &quot;You can&#39;t pass, but boy am I thirsty&quot; to mean &quot;Bring NPC water&quot; so teaching it to read wouldn&#39;t help. <br><br>Also, this should become a niche speedrunning branch, programming an AI to beat the game as fast as possible."
Bro this is amazing
I&#39;d like to see a trained AI on one game of pokemon attempt a new pokemon game. It would be interesting to see how it reacts to the new environment
Honestly I always wanted to see a Thousand players in Gen 1 at the same time it&#39;s awesome
Is it just me or there are lots of new upcoming youtubers in my feed putting seriously months of awesome effort to create such beautiful videos recently.<br>Just love the fact that people are putting so much effort. Really motivating ‚ù§
That bit about AI PTSD in the Pokemon Center was legitimately fascinating
Future Googler:
Great watch. Thanks!
"great video! i appreciate you adding the details saying after changing the method, you restart the training. i always wondered about this but many videos about ai leave out these important pieces of info on how it works"
"Very impressive and admirable work, explained to perfection! I am very admired!<br>However (and don‚Äôt get me wrong) I feel like reading the game‚Äôs specific memory addresses is too supervised. I would suggest you research a model (ML or some heuristic) that can learn to create their own objectives and rewards.<br>If you need help on the project, let‚Äôs have a call! :)"
"You definitely need unique rewards for one off story events. As a human, we get a reward for working out the puzzle, and so an AI should also be rewarded extra for it. It may even lead to it getting out of Mt Moon at some point."
My mind is blown
Great job putting this together! I subscribed!
"I am utterly amazed by videos like these. 5 years in the making for something not even as long as a feature length movie. I applaud your work sir, and respect it highly"
First the AI starts playing Pok√©mon. <br><br>Then it starts playing the human race..
You could set a huge reward like +20 when he gets a badge and when he defeats an elite 4
"I bet you could throw a curve ball in this experiment, with attaching a reward based on time completion. like a counter is going constantly rewarding a higher average reward per frame or minute. this would encourage limited high value exploration, and maybe reflect on frame manipulation not seen or known about to speed runners. Also as far as mt moon and the &quot;dead&quot; hall, you could have a passive reward for taking stair cases/doors so it encourages full exploration and stair usage. <br>would be neat to see a repeat of awkward movements in order to trigger garuentee;d captures as far as speed running goes."
"I am sure you can add in an If code for Oak&#39;s Parcel that if they have it, to take it back to Oak in Pallet Town and then once the Pok√©dex has been obtained, to tell it to return to the previous town while alos catching Pok√©mon."
This is the type of video that inspires me to go back to my own personal projects. GREAT editing too.
Great video :)
"This is such a good video, it‚Äôs crazy how few subscribers you have. I wish you luck and I hope your channel really takes off!"
Doing that much simulation in python is wild
"Even though literally everyone in the comments is already saying it, I feel obligated to as well because i thought the same thing. This video is incredibly well made and deserves all the attention its got and more. This could easily get millions of views"
&gt;5 days ago<br><br><br>&gt;only video<br><br><br>&gt;almost 300k views<br><br><br>We&#39;re witnessing the birth of a new great youtuber
"That was so cool and fascinating, makes me want to try making one model on my own"
"Wow, make more videos please :)"
The quality of this video is insane! Nice work!
"Wow, probably the best AI video I&#39;ve seen"
This is amazing! You answered so many of my questions with your technical section. Thank you!
Pretty cool video
What an amazing project. Great work.
I wonder if a better way to encourage exploration would just be to record net distance from origin and reward increasing this value but simultaneously remove reward for stagnating to prevent getting stuck.
We&#39;ve gone from tool assisted speedruns to assisted tool attempts.
I eon‚Äôs blame the AI for getting lost in Mt Moon
"i really dig the Parallels being drawn to the &quot;non-artificial intelligence&quot; of a Human...like, comparing the Magikarp Salesman to society&#39;s overall habit of eating poorly...that &quot;we do it, because we can, for that Quick Fix&quot; mentality...i mean really, the only Difference is that one person can view an entire &#39;family tree&#39; of an AI&#39;s Evolution, yet were still in the middle of our OWN evolutions..."
"Dude, the production on this video is seriously high quality. Tons of useful info, a tutorial that was actually understandable. You clearly know what you&#39;re talking about with how concisely you broke everything down.<br><br>Please continue making this content"
"It&#39;d be interesting to see what would happen if you took the &quot;exploration&quot; reward away after a certain amount of time, like after winning the first gym badge. By that point, it should seemingly understand how to win gym badges, which would incentivize it to keep moving forward."
"I&#39;m surprised it didn&#39;t learn to exploit the PC with the Max function, depositing and then withdrawing..."
glad i got to watch this before nintendo copy right strikes it
Well done man! Was this your major project? Or do you intend to make more videos like this?
would it be possible for it to build its own table of pokemon caught and the levels of those pokemon in total to be in its reward base on the data of that table this should allow it to use the pc to store pokemon to get new ones to further increase its score a by product of this could be the desire to evolve pokemon as it becomes a new entry on the table giving it a chunk of points when it evolves
"You made a great connection at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m00s"">4:00</a> relating AI&#39;s distractions to our distractions. I think the point would have hit harder if you just point it out and move on, leaving the viewer to chew on it. <br><br>I know that, given how your channel is set up, you like to explicitly explain things from the ground up. But people like a mystery they can chew on sometimes. Plus, you went in directions (with the social media graphic) that is so trite it becomes tacky. <br><br>Great video!! Really enjoyed it."
How can i learn how to do this? Classes?
This is the kind of YouTube content I want to watch.
This is both a visually interesting video and a really interesting concept. Good<br> work!
Very good video. I chose to listen to it on the way to work
Instant sub
"Maybe more damaging moves should have been more rewarding, so it wouldn&#39;t take a year to beat brock."
"Just finished the video and holy hell I need MORE. Subbed and notis on, love you dad"
I think it would be super cool to see this AI eventually reach TAS levels of speed and efficiency at the game.
The quality of this video is amazing. Thanks for saving the technical details at the end
"Wow, great video.  I&#39;ve only done a bit of ML (and no RL) and was completely blown away at what was possible - your explanations were perfect."
This is an amazing video. Please do Johto next!
I need to see this ai beat the game
"MuZero is a computer program developed to master games without knowing their rules.[1][2][3] Its release in 2019 included benchmarks of its performance in go, chess, shogi, and a standard suite of Atari games. The algorithm uses an approach similar to AlphaZero. It matched AlphaZero&#39;s performance in chess and shogi, improved on its performance in Go, and improved on the state of the art in mastering a suite of 57 Atari games (the Arcade Learning Environment), a visually-complex domain.<br><br>MuZero was trained via self-play, with no access to rules, opening books, or endgame tablebases. The trained algorithm used the same convolutional and residual algorithms as AlphaZero, but with 20 percent fewer computation steps per node in the search tree.[4]"
"Are the tracks used in this video modified to have extra reverb or something, or does the content of the video just make them hit different?"
226k views and 6k subs??? Thats criminal
Wait so what if i ean this ai on a 4090 13900k?
Did it just name itself as the ratata?
Basically a 50/50 chance the algorithm picks counterclockwise over clockwise. I bet if it had picked clockwise to go around the perimeter ai wouldn‚Äôt have completely ignored the path to victory road
"Congrats on your first video, super fun, thanks!"
This was super educational! TYSM
"Loved this video! Its fascinating how the AI can get stuck in unexpected local reward minima, such as the animated water and npcs. I can&#39;t wait to see what you have next!"
"My childhood with a modern twist. What a wonderful, well-made video!"
Just noticed you have about 5k subs. Keep it up. I think you are going to blow up üòä
Great video!
amazing
I LOVE the way you visualized this. Seeing the gameplay while you describe it is amazing
THIS IS YOUR FIRST VIDEO?
"Awesome video, that was very entertaining and easy to understand with very little knowledge of AI."
"Seeing the hundreds of MC walking around really allows me to visualise the &quot;Multi-Universe&quot; theory.<br>Everyone&#39;s Cartage is it&#39;s own universe, Everyone is the main Character in their Universe."
"They&#39;re like ants, when one finds something interesting a million more follow soon after."
this is an amazing project!
Depositing pokemon causes the AI to recieve a lifelong trauma is just hilarious
So cool
"I was particularly interested in the technical details, I am going to dig in further! Thank you!!"
"The entire time I was watching this I just kept thinking of more reward function experiments that could be tried. Like, what if we rewarded it for using effective moves? What if we gave it a weak reward for keeping it&#39;s total team HP up? What if we rewarded it for gaining experience instead of levels? What if we gave it more intermediate term goals, like instead of just seeing a new screen, we reward it for getting close to some specific coordinates in the game world?"
god it&#39;s like watching your younger brother play the game..
You need to get the AI through the entire game.  I&#39;ll be here for that video.  Incredible YouTube debut.
"Twitch chat: has traumatic experiences with the PC, causing them to vilify it and its creator.<br><br>AI program: has a traumatic experience with the PC, causing it to never set foot in a Pokemon Center again.<br><br>Yeah I think you might be on to something with the parallels between machine learning and human psychology."
awesome video for the first 20 minutes haha :) no I mean really amazing :)
This is the type of reinforced learning AI video ive been waiting for
amazing video! Love the way you do eloquently explain reinforcement learning. Honestly the part where it had to learn better ways to win battles is so true‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt think about it bc it‚Äôs so simple but without that knowledge you have to go through it like that!!
"Are you telling me, that this AI figured out that money has value and scarcity through buying too many magic karp?<br><br>Dang, me too at a young age."
Absolutely incredibly made video!
QA departments are doomed one of these days
Blitzkreigmon
Excuse me I came for AI Pokemon not why I&#39;m fat and make poor diet choices LOL
every single person: ai is the greatest invention known to man we will never top this wow the future is now and we are living it that&#39;s right bow down to your overlord <br>the ai in question: <b>unable to do something i could do at 6</b>
How did you reward the program for going into the mart to get the ball to Oak?
"I would love to see a continuation/series of this, id watch the hell out of it."
"Good video, though some of the requirements listed use deprecated features/installers. The emulator, Pyboy, is one of them. It uses a deprecated installer, this can&#39;t be easily installed"
Amazing I hope to see more!
The gameboy graphics illustrating the video essay tho... <b>chef&#39;s kiss</b>
This is dope
Thought this would be a video about you teaching Grandpa Albert how to play Pok√©mon :(
"I hope you show the entire kanto map like is shown at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=16m13s"">16:13</a>"
"I wonder how long until it finds Zapdos, or beats Red, or if it can find its way through the dark cave to the east of cerulean city to lavender town‚Ä¶ without flash that‚Äôs hard to do. I say zapdos because he‚Äôs more obscure than the other two, articuno and moltres are easy to find just by taking normal pathing"
"This video deserves millions of views, well done"
"The cheap pokemon really isn&#39;t the same thing as cheap junk food. Humans wanting high calorie foods they stumble across made perfect sense for the environments they were designed for. The fact that modern life is entirely unrelated to those environments would be akin to taking your code and using it for a different game. Really, you&#39;re just designing things badly by making &quot;proxy&quot; objectives instead of actually making the desired objectives and their requirements clear (which you never do)"
Can reward for having pp proportional to max pp. Then it chooses actions equally and finds out moves faster.
"Hahaha, there I was a couple days ago discussing if AI could be used to discover yet unknown speedrunning tricks, and here it cracked RNG manipulation. In only that specific case, but it did. And it did it much easier than a human because a human would never think of doing such a weird walking sequence or noticed that it had an effect or simply had enough time to try out enough approaches to stumble upon it.<br><br>Great video m8, I was surprised it could do that much with just vision, extremely simple status indicator and literally 3 frames of crappy visual short term memory. I&#39;m subscribing and can&#39;t wait for the next video."
Have you ever considered audio input in addition video input? There are a lot of audio effects that can serve as rewards.
It&#39;s crazy that this man&#39;s FIRST VIDEO is better than 90% of other YouTubers
"Incredible idea and video!! That must have been a lot of work to collect and translate all this data into a concise video like this, congrats"
Earned a sub totally smashed the video üéâ
hella cool
"Cool project, amazing editing! Subbed"
Is this example of humans and the misalignment of objectives something that is supported by evidence?
"Ok fine, lll play leisure suit larry again"
Broooooo. Just hanging out and admiring the scenery is totally gaming. Reward that bot! Hit him right in the feel goods!
This video is a masterpiece
"I could never run this, edit the code, or figure out how to set up the servers, but thanks for showing how you did it all. Especially the visualizations, those are so impressive!!"
"Phenomenal video, very fun to watch and has me interested, will check out the repository!"
"Great video. I wonder if and how you would reduce the amount of iterations required to reach the desired result of, say, beating Brock. I guess it would involve with a lot more manual work in terms of coding specifics, which is the opposite of what we want."
"I always wonder why these AIs are never given the option or ability to read text or understand what the cursor does. It seems like everyone doing these types of videos just lets it press random buttons until it figures out which random combination of button presses wins the game.<br>Maybe if it could read &quot;it&#39;s super effective&quot; or realize that the pokedex contains information about the pokemon, it would perform better and actually understand the game."
subbbbed
"I have no programming knowledge whatsoever, I don&#39;t even know why YouTube recommended me this video, but goddamn that was entertaining. Loved this."
stochastic movement? new word for me.
"You can&#39;t stop here, we need to see them beat Ass Oak."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=14m19s"">14:19</a><br><br>do not fear the man who has 10,000 battles<br>fear the man who has a party size of 10,000 and its all magikarp"
The AI had to touch every single part of the game. Every movement possible was done
"I think an interesting reward idea is to have the ai set a goal and be rewarded upon the goals completion. This, working in tandem with a &quot;secret reward&quot; that is given when the secret reward and the ai goal is accomplished at the same time. The idea here is that the secret goal is the in game story, thus teaching the ai to follow the plot. Although this would require the ai to have long term memory as well as the ability to read."
"Ah... a shame you that at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=18m00s"">18:00</a> you decided to choose blue, green and red for visualizing the evolution. As someone with colorblindness it&#39;s very to almost impossible difficult to see the difference between green and red<br><br>Overall this was a very fun video to watch. Not only for entertainment, but also for learning how it works together, about problems, costs and what you&#39;ve done and tried to make it better. The video was very well made, great quality/ editing/ music choice/ scripted and voiced. I&#39;m looking forward for you are planning for the next video, if there will be more! :)"
When you said the training cost $1000 i immediately liked and subscribed. Excited to see what you do in the future
Immediately subbed; first video I&#39;ve seen and you&#39;re one of like three channels that I have notifications on for. Well done
"Awesome stuff, hope you finish this though :p"
"This video reminds me of when I got Pokemon Yellow as a kid, I didn&#39;t read/speak english so I just had to try things to learn what everything did and was. It&#39;s weird how similar the AI playing feels to my experiences as a kid. <br><br>The Pokemon games (among TV and other games) actually helped me learn english at the age of 9 far before my classmates could and as a little extra ROM hacking got me into graphic design and coding/web development somehow. Pokemon in general is the base of my origin story."
"I hope you continue releasing more video updates on this, this was an incredible deep dive on AI behavior with 2D turn based RPGs."
"I&#39;m only about 22 mins in, and forgive me if my lack of understanding of AI (or failure to finish the video BEFORE commenting) invalidates this question but: Would it be possible to train an AI to play this game the same way a human would learn? Ex. give it the context for what the various controls do and what the goal is (ie. feed it the original instruction manual), have it learn using a language model to understand the text presented on-screen (basically, ChatGPT Plays Pokemon), and then apply the rest of the AI algorithms/models after (reinforcement/reward)?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=3m44s"">3:44</a> The AI is... cooming üòÇ"
I was going to make this exact thing and then make it nuzlocke. Give negative points for losing a Pok√©mon. I would also have to mod the game to have the Pok√©mon disappear once it faints and reset the game once you wipe
"Hey! This was an awesome video! Mid-video I began to wonder how you made these visualizations for the video, and even for that you‚Äôve given us a glimpse into! Loved the project and your dedication to it!"
What an amazing video. I would love to see more videos like these. I wonder if it can be done with Crash Bandicoot?
"I think it&#39;s best to start the AI with 10,000 points, subtract 1 every time it bumps into an obstacle, add 50 every time it gains a new pokedex entry, add 100 every time it discovers a new area (by name, AKA Cerulean City) then any time the AI does more than 1/3 of an opponents hp with a single attack, while the opponent is within 5 levels of it&#39;s Pokemon, the AI should gain like 2 points. Lastly finding items in the overworld should give it an additional 5 points. This encourages exploration in a less stupid way and ensures your AI gets better at battling and buffing itself up."
Super impressed in merging the videos of all those runs together with pieced together zoomed out map. That seems very tricky
"I really appreciate what you did in this video. I have been getting ambitious in learning and making code in the recent years. Seeing this kind of stuff with Ai is interesting and thoughtful. Would like to see more projects in the future from you, on similar things."
"The AI buying Magikarp is pretty much an exact representation of how a kid played this game for the very first time when it came out. The box told us that you &#39;gotta catch them all&#39;, and the game is presenting the chance to get a pokemon. The reward of obtaining one is fulfilled."
Why is the AI so cute omg
Finding out AIs can get traumatized made me go :(
"I dont usually comment on yt videos but i want this one to reach more people, just like it reached me. This taught me more about AI than tons of articles and other videos, and ill for sure be passing it on to others in order to explain these concepts in a clear, entertaining, and insightful way. I hope we see more videos from you in the future, youve got a sub for life!"
Honestly just wanted to say well done! The editing was just as cool as the data! Thank you for such a great video
"I busted out laughing when the AI simply stopped playing to avoid losing a point. üòÇ Like eff you, we&#39;re both losing lmao."
"I&#39;m so glad the YouTube algorithm decided to recommend your video and I clicked on it. It&#39;s a fascinating thing to watch the process and journey that the AI goes through, while the presentation of the whole video is equally fantastic. Great video, you all deserve a round of applause for the effort and quality put into this whole project."
"You should reward it the most for catching a unique pokemon, or give it a reward based on the pokemons number."
I‚Äôm hitting the subscribe button. This will give you +1 reward any you should be incentivized to make more videos like this as a result. ü´°
Strong
"watching the little reds go round like an ant colony brings me so much joy and i don&#39;t know why. look at them all exploring. learning. discovering the world. lil guys. thank you for spending at least 1000USD and several hours putting this together just for me to uncontrollably laugh at the reds for 20 minutes<br><br>..with that out of the way, fantastic video. incredibly readable visuals and clear voiceover, awesome topic, understandable for several levels of previous knowledge. can see this hitting the high hundred thousands."
Behaviorists are having a field day with AI.
Would love a follow up video to develop it further.
The Typewriter Monkeys got their hands on Pokemon Red!!!
Why does gene 1 music slap so hard?
Why that grilled cheese look so good tho
"This was all very interesting, but as an average doofus, my favorite part was that it liked to name its pokemon AAAAAAAA"
The ai getting ptsd from the pokemon center is hilarious.
Need to see ai finish the game!!
"I was thinking the seeking novelty bit could be replaced much more efficiently if you just recorded the movements. You could tell if they were reaching new areas based on reaching new intervals of values. Or really coordinates compared to the start as 0,0"
It learns like a child
I always bought the Magikarp üòä
Amazing video! Can&#39;t wait to see more of these!! ü´∂
"Excellent video, not only is the content interesting but the presentation is clean, enjoyable and you manage to make a good explanation that is easy to digest. It&#39;s hard to find videos of this quality and I hope the subscriptions and likes keep incresing, you deserve it. I ended attached to the little AI and i would love to see it adventures in other pokemon games or other gamesüëçüëçüëç"
Realllllly well done! Impressive stuff through and through. Plus a lot of fun to watch.
So fkin cool!
Feels like the way i played pokemon as a 5 yr old üò≠
Are we gonna be speed running our AIs?
This is really cool! Love the way you showed the progress!
"This video was not long enough! My word it definitely taught me why I fell in love with Pokemon games growing up as a child, the process of the challenges and rewards, almost giving up only to ultimately roll up my gloves and stick through it. I really loved the metaphors and analogies and was dying to see the whole game all the way through. I&#39;m curious to see what team the AI would have assembled and if it would evolve the Magikarp to Gyarados. Actually one of the coolest videos on YouTube I&#39;ve ever seen!!"
This is adorable. I love watching the cute little idiots scurry around.
"videos like these are always cool to watch with no coding experience! i find it very interesting that  AI is able to do all this with the actual bare minimum going into it regardless of the time frame, good video man!"
Calling something that doesnt really act intelligently an AI in 2023 leads to this being a bit disappointing.
"Hey AI, The Pokemon Center isn&#39;t real. It can&#39;t hurt you."
What if we rewarded it every time it discovered what type is super effective against other types?
I hope I don‚Äôt get constipated diarrhea.
No going at a pokemon center because of PTSD XD
"i‚Äôm eager to see the day ai can play the game, learn the code and design another pok√©mon game from what it‚Äôs learned with its own assets, maps, ui‚Ä¶ then i would like to play that game"
"This video was excellent, I appreciate the polish and the great pacing. Glad the algorithm threw your channel my way."
"When you zoom out and show the whole city, the AI trainers make me think of ants :)"
"Now, imagine you have several agents instead of one, how would that work? Have a battle ai, an exploration ai, a director ai and have them all work with each other to finish the game?"
This is incredibly impressive man
"If you&#39;re going to do this again, may I suggest a few rewards?<br>-Increases and decreases with money (encourages winning battles)<br>-Increases with seen Pok√©mon (encourages discovering new areas)<br>-Increases with owned Pok√©mon (encourages catching new species and evolving)<br>-Increases with badges (encourages defeqting gym leaders)<br>-Increases after defeating the Elite 4 for the first time (encourages beating the Elite 4)<br>-Decreases if the screen does not change for over three seconds (discourages stalling)"
"God, I&#39;d love to be able to experiment with this, but I&#39;m not at all knowledgeable about coding. Like, I could see the rewards being fine tuned to work really well.<br><br>The main thing that I&#39;m thinking about first though is using Pokemon yellow. Having it gain major points for having a new Pokemon in its dex (Through catching, evolving, or being gifted something). Have its goal be to defeat the Elite 4 and catch all 150 Pokemon (I&#39;d say 151, but I don&#39;t know how long it&#39;d take to find Mew lol).<br><br>Have it being rewarded for when they challenge a gym leader or E4 member, giving them the same amount of reward as when they fail, so they don&#39;t just farm it forever. Then they get a massive reward for defeating a gym leader.<br><br>You can also apply stuff for type effectiveness. Having not very effective moves give -1 reward might be bad in the long run (Could get locked into using statuses), but giving a point for using super effective moves during a Trainer Battle might be good.<br><br>Then every increment of 10 Pokemon that it catches applies major rewards, with it scaling quickly. Could go from 2 to 4 to 8, 16, 32, etc. Doing so allows them to get important items (Which can also give them more rewards), and, if everything goes well, their final goal could be to capture Mewtwo.<br><br>I&#39;d say just have capturing a level 70 Mewtwo give a ton of rewards (Or double their current rewards, if possible, leaving them with the highest score possible after completing all of the other objectives), but I feel like it&#39;d learn to clip at some point to get it lol.<br><br>I really feel like it could capture Mew as well, but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;d be a good thing to strive for. It could take irl weeks or months for it to learn how to glitch it in to appear. I could see maybe an edited version of the game that has Mew being available after Mewtwo via using strength on the truck or something as well?<br><br>Sorry for the long post, but I just got excited lol. Great video!"
A mapping out of the consciousness through the reflection of technology.
I can relate. When I was 5 years old playing Pokemon red I definitely spent hours exploring pallet town. üòÇ
insane... Where did you study?
"This was quite intriguing seeing the progression of the AI with detailed explanation of the behaviours and the road block each iteration a set faces, with the resolution to said road block for the next iteration."
I&#39;d tweak the reward system to consider:<br>- Finding an item on the field or from an NPC<br>- Finding a key item<br>- Registering new pok√©mon on the dex
The AI getting absolutely traumatized by putting a mon in the pc is so funny to me üò≠
Seeing this I&#39;d love to see an AI play earthbound!
banger video
"fantastic video bud, well done."
I love the comparisons to our own brains throughout this. Very engaging video and really well structured. Can&#39;t wait to see more from this channel :)
training AI to gently massage my balls with reinforcement learning
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m00s"">4:00</a> was really hoping you&#39;d say something silly like &quot;maybe we stop here... we&#39;ve learned a valuable life lesson.&quot;"
"I like the idea of giving it a sort of fake memory by encoding some additional state in the input image. I&#39;m wondering what would happen if you added a way for the agent to directly modify the image (e.g. letting it toggle color values in 10 or so pixels), giving it a sort of notebook."
imagine doing this with gold/silver and making capturing a shiny pokemon give like 1000 reward
"This is absolutely awesome, thank you!"
I could watch this type of video all day
Could we try this with other pokemon games like emerald?
Why does the script keep coming back to the ai v human anecdotes. Not to sound harsh but it&#39;s like this was written by chat gpt
"I&#39;m at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=11m00s"">11:00</a> for reference, no idea of points after that for this comment.<br>I&#39;ve got to ask the question if it was possible for you to make every combat an &#39;instance&#39; of sorts, if the issue of depositing pokemon was a major setback, having some way to total the stats of a pokemon, or calculating a reward based on the damage taken, if they won the fight and a few other variables, rewarding the AI more for overcoming harder fights, or rewarding the AI for becoming good at surviving fights without taking damage or using a large amount of PP, which could also be connected to the AI learning how to &#39;restore&#39; the reward through healing, allowing it to develop a sense of preparedness. From the looks of it you are only rewarding some kind of flat value for winning fights or for levelling, so the AI could in a sense learn to minmax the starting area constantly, only to heal when required, as oppose to earning more reward for succeeding in harder battles."
So ants are ai
"5k subs, he will rise up"
"this is a well made video and project, the homespun philosophy aspect was just extremely corny"
Such a good video! Thx!
"amazing video. would love to see an ai that was given rewards based on the games intrinsic objectives, like gym badges and pokedex entries"
Oh gods.
Great work!
This is amazing.
"I love this. Is there any way to make the AI reach for a specific goal, that it hasn&#39;t experienced before? Like catching Mew? From my understanding it wouldn&#39;t try to even if it was worth a million points, cause it doesn&#39;t know of this reward and would only persue others, that keep it from accidentally discovering it."
Great Stuff!
Damn. The AI got Traumatized by a Pokemon Center.
"I never understood a thing about AI reinforcement learning and maybe someone can explain this to me:<br>In reinforced learning, we train an AI from scratch to do a thing and see how it progresses. This is fine and all and interesting in it&#39;s own way. But why not acquaint the AI first with the rules and then make it try their hand at it?<br><br>I mean, we give them rules about the game&#39;s input, but why not the game mechanics and game objective as well? And train them faster this way? I&#39;m not saying to teach them different strategies as well, just the mechanics and basic rules.<br><br>As a human, you often want to read a manual or let someone else explain you the rules of the game before you start. But for a reason I don&#39;t fully understand it gets the input rules but not the rest."
"The quality of the video absolutely blew my mind. From the conceptualisation, to the observations, to the analysis, to the visualization, to the technicalities, to the future works and to top it off is all reproducible! This is an absolute masterclass in science communication!"
I never knew how expensive ai training was. Gosh. I&#39;m incredibly impressed by how determined you were to do this.
"Dropping a comment to help the algorithm. This video honestly deserves millions of views. I love the part where the AI learned to RNG manip to catch a Rattata. It&#39;s one of those moments that&#39;s unexpected at first but when you go back and look at it it&#39;s like, &quot;oh, of course it would react like that!&quot; Moments like those are why I love AI learning videos like this."
"I take it this AI cannot use information gleaned from NPCs... Seems like it&#39;s not really &quot;learning&quot; anything. Oh sure, it started using bubble at Brock&#39;s gym, but does it know WHY it&#39;s super effective? It hasn&#39;t even learned a core principle of the game: type weaknesses."
The point of Brock was to teach about type effectiveness and the difference when using the special stat for offence instead of the standard attack. <br>Onix has weak attack stat on purpose to give time for the players to learn.<br>The AI learned the intended lesson.
man this is so impressive
"Even if I&#39;ll never reach that skill limit or fully understanding or even replicating it, I learned A LOT!<br><br>Extremely:<br>- awesome idea,<br>- well explained,<br>- well edited,<br>- insipiring<br><br>Can&#39;t imagine how you came up with the idea, where you got all the potential and knowledge from, and then even put all the time and effort to pour it all into code &quot;just like that&quot;. Simply fascinating! (Edit: Though, from the looks of your GitHub, I can make a well formed guess...)<br>Respect to all of it!"
Why not try providing all map information to the ai and use goal based reinforcement? Like adding rewards based on speed? <br>Might require a lot of up front coding just to provide all that information though.
"A way to teach it simple typing could be less damage = point rule out min, max and, crit damage. That should leave ether efficiency with no fear of losing points or it could freeze in anxiety over what possible fight well be nextüòÖ"
This was insane.
Really great work. I love the two part video format. This AI is really impressive! Excited for more from this channel!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=18m15s"">18:15</a> I don&#39;t see any red I only see yellow."
Did you really need to spend 1k on servers it seems like a lot I would of though a beefy 16 core computer being able to run it.
So basically we are playing God with a two-dimensional World from this three-dimensional plane.
I didn&#39;t expect to learn so much watching this and I love it!
"great video with great comparison with mankind, excellently made"
Wow. It would be amazing to know how to mess with this in the code itself. Please show us one day. I&#39;d definitely watch that.
The flood
Did it deliver Oak&#39;s parcel????
Ai traumatized by technology
Scizor used rock against paper. 50 points to Gryffindor
gg
"Please post the footage of all the ai trying to learn, like when they all were trying to learn how to leave pallet town, it‚Äôs really calming and would make a pretty good screensaver."
awesome work my dude
Great video :)
This is amazing! I love all the Reds walking along together.<br>I just wonder if the ai would ever figure out TM&#39;s and if it could even get to use Surf or Strength.
My favorite part was at the 30 minute mark when all I saw was matrix lines
"This is so well done it&#39;s actually mindblowing. IMO this raises the bar for these types of videos, thanks for sharing."
Amazing video
"You say later iterations are shown in red, but that‚Äôs clearly orange leaning towards yellow."
"This was actually so educational! Great video! Keep it up! If this is your first video, I can&#39;t wait to see how good your future ones will be."
nice
"Exploration is not the goal so I don&#39;t think it should be rewarded. In fact, it should be punished for wasting time. Therefore, time should also be considered. Also, not being able to recognize texts in the game is also a huge handicap."
Epic!
Who are you bro? How does your first video have a sponsor? How did you know how to catch the algorithm? Why is your script so well written and your video so entertaining?
Maybe WE are the algorithms.
This video and channel are going to the moon
I thought your channel image was yandere dev for a sec
"Great video, great editing too, love the timelapses"
This channel is about to become the next AngieTheGreat I can feel it
"Wow, considering your sub count, this video absolutely blew up! Well deserved, what an awesome project! :D"
"Fantastic video! I‚Äôm a robotics engineer in my day job and this was a great explanation of reinforcement learning! Great work!  <br><br>One question ‚Äî in your overlay visualizations, sometimes the avatar just stops in its tracks. Is this a developed behavior or simply when it runs out of time during the two-hour gameplay window?"
I want to see AI beat pokemon red. Subscribed just for the hope.
"What kills me about these AI videos is most all use reinforcement learning. Most games are mazes, especially Pok√©mon! It‚Äôs a maze, with battles, and internal puzzles‚Ä¶. So the best place to start with these AI plays, is not reinforcement learning, it‚Äôs the same way they build maze solving robots! <br><br>That realm has figured out rapid problem solving AI with no prior information about the course. Translating physical actions into machine data way faster than reinforcement learning."
The visuals of many attempts at once look like an ant farm
"Here&#39;s my idea for rewarding exploration, instead of how it&#39;s done here, why not a reward for each new chunk entered.  Maybe combine that with a negative reward for staying still for more than 5 cycles.  Also, maybe a reward for every interactable map object, like PCs, NPCs and signs, I understand that this one could be complex based on how pokemon is coded."
"15 mins in and this is based af. Sick take on the comparisons between AI and our own intelligence. Easy sub, looking forward to your other content."
"bro, this is excellent work, the AI just bruteforcing it&#39;s way to everything until it&#39;s forced to learn a way around is fascinating."
"I always liked collecting items and getting new dialogue, I wonder how that can be leveraged. oo I also wonder how a &quot;catch them all&quot; would go??? maybe with a romhack that has all pokemon available somehow?"
"Man, this got to be the coolest thing I&#39;ve ever seen. Thanks for making this sir!"
Disappointed it didn‚Äôt get to finish the game because it was so enjoyable to watch it progress and you tell it so well. But then when you said how expensive it is üò±
That was a mind-blowing documentary. Thanks !!!
"Question: can an AI be built to shiny hunt? For example, in GSC, it would be awesome to train an AI to shiny hunt mons and catching them lol"
"I think this is a great video, and I really dig the way you&#39;ve seamlessly transitioned into drawing parallels from the process of AI training and Human behavior, as it makes it much easier to understand certain quirks of how computer programs in general function under very strict conditions, which can lead to some oddities. I think it&#39;s an interesting way of putting some context on the subject, although I would advise to always be very careful when dealing with psychology, as it is a very complicated subject and the general public is not well-versed in it, which means that spouting things that aren&#39;t necessarily true, or perhaps even worse, <b>almost true*, can leave people with warped views on how humans function, and with such an important topic as psychology, when mistruths spread, it can do *a</b> <b>lot</b> of damage.<br><br>This doesn&#39;t mean that your video is bad or anything of the sort, I simply would like to emphasize that psychology, especially evolutionary psychology, is a subject where speculation, even if somewhat accurate, is possibly harmful, and to the average youtube viewer, unsourced statements can come off more as fact than possibilities, so I would caution against putting an interpretation in absolute terms, you can even use weasel words if you&#39;d like, just a disclaimer beforehand would suffice. For example, with the Magikarp &amp; Junk food segment, you could say something like &quot;a comparison <b>*could*</b> be drawn to&quot; or &quot;you <b>*could*</b> say that&quot;, rather than putting it as the only explanation for why people buy junk food. Cheers!"
Neat.
"What a phenomenal video! From the narration, visuals, and technical detail covered! Thank you so much for making this video!!"
It&#39;s like watching tiny ants üêú
Not sure what else to say but good fucking job on this video.
Mind blowing! Congratulations!
"I‚Äôd love to see this process taken all the way to the end of the game, but $1,000 just to get past the first gym is insane"
üòé cool
"oh my god id love to use this if<br>1. i knew how to code something to work like this<br>2. if it worked for my favorite pokemon games, pokemon gsc (ik the code is really similar between games but idk how similar)"
"As I have no experience in coding/AI and all that fun stuff I was very curious to ask about an opinion on FoxMaster and his Tomb Raider playing AI- besides his &#39;explenaition&#39; and possibly his own &#39;debunking&#39; through the Decomposer-channel I can&#39;t tell. It sure seems reasonable to say it&#39;s fake bc I don&#39;t understand anyways, but it&#39;s also dump to just &#39;i don&#39;t understand; therefore it must be fake&#39; and my curiousity kills me &gt;8&lt; (both ways great entertainment there, wouldn&#39;t be mad on either sides, as it would be impressive enough to script an AI fake- eh..ironic genius x3)"
Wow it‚Äôs incredible that this is your first video. I‚Äôm definitely looking forward to future content!
"Well this is interesting, I&#39;m used to the videos training AI to learn smaller things, not Pokemon lol"
What do you use to reward the ai ? üòÇ
only 2.33k??? this is insane quality
Chaotic Pok√©mon gameplay? A strong aversion to getting anywhere near the PC? This all sounds very familiar...
Oh how I aspire to be the AI playing this game for the first time again
Amazing video! Realy love it
"This could be handfeeding the AI, but adding a + reward for Super effective text, and a - reward for not super effective text could encourage experimentation on move lists and help it progress and learn type advantages."
Awesome AI video Id love to see a follow up on this one maybe pushing to see if the ai can make it to surf and fly or maybe even the elite four üòÇ
Nice Job!
maybe if you gave the ai a base knowledge on the game and the ability to understand text and what it means could help the ai
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=8m40s"">8:40</a> reminds me of a story about a Tetris AI that hit start to pause the game right before it would lose."
Can&#39;t wait for Code Bullet to try this.
"This video actually does a great job of highlighting one of the major hurdles holding AI back, its unable to truly understand and put into context the information it learns."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=3m55s"">3:55</a><br>This statement is strangely profound"
What a fascinating case study. So many odd quirks and pitfalls to fall into.
"Eagerly awaiting more videos, I would love to see a full run of the AI beating the game. Maybe applying the same AI to every Pok√©mon game after it beats this one to see if it can use its current knowledge to beat the next game in the series."
An AI therapist helping it with its traumatic experience in a Pokemon center. Touching.
What a glorious watch. As a longtime Pok√©mon fan since the original Red/Blue I find this wildly fascinating. Thank you!
Amazing video! I was completely convinced the junk food comparison was going to be accompanied by an ad for Hello Fresh or something. Talk about reinforcement.
So this ai learns like Naruto using the kage bunshin -jutsu
- AI enters flash tunnel<br><b>AI be like WTFUQ</b>
"When traversing these games, I found myself to explore in a counter clockwise fashion, so it&#39;s kinda funny to hear the AI doing the same lol"
"Wrt the averaion to backtracking, because the game requires some level of backtracking, i would assign significant rewards to certain accomplishments like receiving the pokedex, acquiring the drink and giving the drink ti the guard, etc."
Naming your Pok√©mon ‚ÄúAAAAA‚Äù‚Ä¶ classic.
"This was excellent, thanks so much for this<br><br>Also loved the animations of the little ai ash&#39;s running around"
"Stunning video, look forward to more from you!"
teach AI to speedrun pok√©mon!!!
"I‚Äôm not a programmer, but if you have the ai a point score for ‚Äútalk to oak with oak‚Äôs parcel in your bag‚Äù would that solve your early game problem? Would ‚Äúland a super effective hit‚Äù being positive reinforcement also speed up some sections?"
As someone who edits videos for fun.<br>I have no idea how this video was edited lol.<br>Good video!
"i wish i had the resources to do some training on my own, id be interested in seeing how a curiousity-based model would do, rather than providing hand-picked rewards. theoretically it should learn to explore just as well, and the problem with coming into a similar looking area in the cave should be fixed too as it would learn that some locations may appear similar but are really different so its still worth exploring. though not having any memory would mean it might still get lost in those areas and would have to rely on using a rule like always going anticlockwise to traverse.<br><br>also that is probably one of the reasons why this one always goes anticlockwise, since it makes it easier to know which direction it wanted to go in, although it does have past frames it would be harder for the ai to learn to see which direction the frames are moving in, then just which side it is on gives a different direction."
Stop saying ‚Äúwe‚Äù when you mean ‚ÄúI.‚Äù Many of your oversights were easy for many viewers to pinpoint before you recapped them.
And this is your first video? wow
"Love the video dude, hope you had fun"
The AI realizing that blacking out is bad and doesn&#39;t press any more buttons after losing is such a smartass answer.<br><br>&quot;The only winning move is not to play.&quot;
is there a way to make an AI that starts off knowing stuff about the game and is able to get better? Just asking cause most people tend on YouTube to make AIs than only know how to push buttons.
"Wow, this video is actually legendary ngl"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=3m35s"">3:35</a> The AI has ADHD"
"Aside from the effort, patience and skill that went into conducting the experiment, I want to highlight the great visualization and narration. This video was a treat to watch!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=8m30s"">8:30</a> a solution for this could have been to subtract reward every (few) second(s), this would cause it to not sit idly, and also to hurry up in its exploration, perhaps not spending so much time running around aimlessly farming exploration points (though im not sure how often it did that), and going for higher value rewards"
"I LOVE to use ML-Agents in Unity, and this was AWSOME!!! I would LOVE to see more content like this!!"
i think you should add a separate reward system that applies only to battles. like if it finds a weakness it‚Äôll remember to use water against rock
He makes teaching an AI sound like teaching a child which it is similar to I have to Admit
"Amazing video, great presentation and explanation!<br><br>Also unexpectedly funny sometimes:<br>@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=8m34s"">8:34</a><br><br>&quot;Press A to confirm your defeat&quot;<br>Giga Chad AI &quot;No&quot;"
"This was so fun to watch, hope you go viral bc you definitely deserve it"
Great video!<br>It‚Äôs great how you explain the problems you have experienced while training AI and your unique solutions!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=14m20s"">14:20</a> dawg who let the tech bro talk about evolutionary psychology? please stop"
Oh to be a baby AI learning how to play pokemon and getting rewarded with +1
Love that in order to avoid losing points the AI just became stubborn and refused to accept defeat
Very interesting video! Now it would be interesting to see a version where the AI has to choose the starter as well so we can see which one it elects to choose...
The way you personify the AI and its learning is just so charming. Adorable lil AI with big journeys in front of it.
YouTube suggested this video to me. Finally a good choice! Extremely entertaining and well made video. Thank you!
Dang you put a lot of work into this. Hope you get more subs and views üëç
Make a reward for Super Effective moves. I imagine it&#39;ll start associating enemy names with move names
Great first video man can&#39;t wait to see more this was very interesting the A I is having a full life looking at the water and plants then later has a breakdown truly we are the same
but can it pray to the Helix?
The thought that we traumatized the AI brings me a weird sort of satisfaction
I wanna see it beat the game<br><br>  ü•∫<br>üëâüëà
"What an absolutely phenomenal video! This was fascinating and I really hope to see more you. I genuinely was in shock when I saw this was your first video and that you only have a few thousand subscribers because this is at the standard of creators with hundreds of thousands, if not millions of viewers. Keep it up, please! ‚ù§"
self replicating Ketchum syndrome
"These Visuals yo, so good yo"
"Mate, this is fascinating! Thank you for the effort!"
"I&#39;m getting some kind of engineering type vibe from you, guessing EE or CS??"
Give it enough time it will eventually do ACE and start rewriting the game itself. That would be fun to watch.
Amazing video
We should all donate cpu time for this project collectively :D kind of like sheepit in blender.
The ai owns the most magicarps ever . This is scary when they evolve .
"Fantastic work and video. Avoiding pokecenters at first was an interesting emergent behavior. I wondered why it didn&#39;t simply avoid the PC, but when you look at which cells are open and which are chokepoints, it makes sense. <br><br>One thing I missed, how does each iteration end? Does each agent have a time limit within which to maximize reward? That seems necessary to control compute spend, but also limits available strategies. In a different framework like a GAN or actor-critic, what other ways can we operationalize the objective?"
The animations on this video are superb. Really well made!
interesting that the ai never chose another starter than squirtle
"Commenting so others will hopefully see this, one of the most well put together videos I have watched in a while. Hoping for more in the future."
This video blessed my algorithm. More like this please!
"Just so you know... I built a dual xeon 4.0ghz with 12 total cores and 24 virtual threads, and 98gb of ram for under $1000 by buying  off Amazon. These were often parts data centers were migrating out.. it&#39;s been running all my media and game servers for years now. I did throw in an old 1080 so that would be additional cost, but that&#39;s like $400 for a more modern used card. <br><br>I&#39;d much rather own my hardware."
"Please, Please add +1000000 reward for AI if it catches shiiny pokemon. Maybe ther is a way to replicate this even but for us humans it is not possible :D"
"This was really good, thanks for making it."
I love how it got traumatised by the pokemon centre. I genuinely felt bad for the lil guy
"Curious if you could use this AI and everything it learned in Gold/silver, and so on. Also, kind of funny to think about whether the AI sees itself as the Red sprite."
Instead of levels couldn&#39;t you have used combined HP instead?
The AI is so cute must protect
This might just be my new favourite youtube video
Good stuff man. You clearly know what you&#39;re talking about and its easy to understand. You&#39;ve got something here.
Everyone already said it but this was a great video!! I loved seeing the ai&#39;s journey towards becoming a pokemon master ü§ö
"I&#39;ve never thought that the ML model getting a trauma of the pokemon center would warrant the creepy Lavender Town music, but here we are and now I feel sad for the AI"
At the 24 minute mark I considered if i was duped into watching a school class project.
Suggestions: tiny rewards for total delta of x y from the start point of the game. Also for total x y over the last few steps.  The interplay of these deltas can prevent getting lost in similar terrains. <br><br>Big reward for seeing new dialogues from npcs.  This can be balanced by distance and time to prevent the ai from just waiting around for long periods and them talking to npcs. The human form of this is when you are stuck on a quest and you finally go back around to the places you&#39;ve been and find the npc that progresses the access to new areas. Very rewarding.
"Man... I&#39;m a programmer, but I don&#39;t even have a clue how I would approuch such a project"
This was amazing. Ive been working with AI for a long time and I learned alot watching this.
There is something disturbing in seeing so many ‚Äûplayers‚Äú cramped into these small spaces ‚Äî my Pok√©mon associations feel violated :D<br>Nice analysis!
this is amazin
"&quot;ooh, what&#39;s this place?&quot;<br>&quot;deposit Pokemon?&quot;<br>&quot;AAAAAAHHHHHHH&quot;<br><b>never returns</b>"
This was a really really insightful video. Did you do this out of your own curiosity?
"I have some ideas to maybe improve the AI.<br>1) was the AI able to recognize individual tiles or only individual screens? If you let it assign memories of yhe effects of tile types you could have it start to recognize walls, buildings, people, grass, paths, etc without having to bump into each of them every time it reaches a new area. This could streamline pathfining in the long run prevent the flytrap situation once it learns to recognize 1 way ledges. (And i figure this wont take more memory than all those screenshots it compares)<br><br>2) maybe give a small reward for new diologue. This will train it to talk to NPCs to get items and progress the game (may fix the oaks parcel segment too).<br><br>3) going back to the tile memory suggestion, base the exploration reward on building an internal map and exposing new tiles. This could help it get through same looking tunnels if it knows it has moved and that moving exposes more tiles. My overall expectaion with its pathing is it will zig zag through paths to fill its map until it hits a dead end instead of the follow the wall default. Also, it will be important for it to know when it bonks.<br><br>I&#39;ve never messed with AI before, let me know if there is a problem with my thinking."
"makes a silly AI to play pokemon, becomes an anthropologist"
"Interesting to see. Would love to see how this goes on a longer run. I imagine there will be quite a few hurdles to overcome (HM&#39;s and the usage of them being maybe a big one). As for exploration, and having to back track at times. Wouldn&#39;t it make sense to give it new rewards for things it has seen already by removing old data after a set amount of time, or move it into an area where it gets a smaller reward perhaps than something it has not seen at all (to make it prioritise new things, but if nothing new is found it is motivated to back track as well). <br><br>Have had some trouble getting it to run on Windows through WSL and a python venv to tinker with it. Will have to give it a shot on my Linux environment when I am done fixing that install. xD"
Here is something I didn&#39;t know I needed to watch
"Okay, but how many looked under the pickup truck?"
Great video!!
"Incredibile content, astonishing visuals and very clear explanation. Thanks and keep up the good work!"
Plot twist: this experiment made us realize WE are AIs... ahahhahaüòÖ
I adore those direction graphs at the end.
Wouldn&#39;t be possible have AI to be trained for battles separatelly? I feel like it could solve lot of issues.
So kage bunshin no jutsu is proof that Naruto is simply AI
Out of curiosity I‚Äôm wondering if you can add a ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù system to improve its growth. Like if it inputs a command thag isn‚Äôt possible to preform it is ‚Äúpunished‚Äù so it can learn to not press inputs thag don‚Äôt do anything or avoid hitting walls
What? AAAAAA is evolving!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=33m20s"">33:20</a> the power light on the gameboy isn&#39;t on. :("
"I can confirm this is how I played the game as a little kid with no knowledge of the English language.<br><br>What the hell is an &#39;Oak&#39;s Parcel&#39;? Why do you have to return to Pallet Town? Idk, but it works."
"This was awesome, I&#39;d love to see a full series of the AI completing the game."
"I can&#39;t run this program myself... none of the files work. I downloaded the exact Pokemon Red ROM you said, and got the Python emulator, but nothing works. Help?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=29m38s"">29:38</a> &quot;The next step is to legally obtain your Pokemon Red ROM&quot; üòè"
"If you ever try to make the AI learn how to play the entire game, you should modify the rewards so that the AI doesn&#39;t get rewarded for putting a pokemon in and out of the Pokebox. The way you modifyed the rewards, would reward the AI for this action. Putting pokemon inside box = nothing, taking it out = big reward (endless reward loop)."
This is a awesome video man keep up the work!
"This is awesome, thanks for sharing!"
"Top tier video man! Well thought out story telling, Unique problems+solutions and professional visualizations."
"it&#39;s cruel of you not to give the AI music, you sicken me"
"This video was done incredibly! A perfect demo of and comparison to deep learning. A well earned follow. The dedication, creativity, and in depth descriptions are beyond impressive for this being the first video on this channel. Keep at it! I&#39;ll be looking forward to what ever you produce next!"
kind of bummed you had to stop at mt. moon but maybe we&#39;ll see more one day. great work. always love seeing stuff like this
"This is such a cool vid! I was wondering, would adding the Pok√©Dex as an incentive be a good way for the AI to progress the game? Something like +1 for seen and +2 for caught? That way it&#39;s encouraged to find new trainers to battle and explore new areas for new Pok√©mon. This might help with your beginning of the game problem too since once it&#39;s seen the starter, Pidgey and Rattata it&#39;ll need to find another route to catch Pok√©mon on (assuming it doesn&#39;t instantly try to evolve any of them)."
What if we are all just AI being loaded up into planet earth and there‚Äôs a divine creator watching all of our lives the same way you watch all of the AIs playthrough just to watch us learn and try to beat the ‚Äúgame‚Äù
Fantastic animations! Also debugging the reward was very interesting to see.
"It need to finish the run!<br>Amazing Video, keep going dudeüëç"
So ... Soon we will play the (N)PCs and fight off a AI Hero ? Coming full circle?
Wow this was awesome
this was incredible to watch
"College aged, spends 1000 bucks on Cloud GPU experiments and has a Mac... geeze you weren&#39;t exactly born into poverty now were you?"
"Alternate title: Professor Oak deploys his clone army to overrun the region, and annihilate team rocket"
Can you be used to catch shiny Pok√©mon?
"Wanting to run from battle when only magikarp remained was so damn relatable, bloody fish, just hurry up and evolve already"
"How much work would this be to modify to run a different game, like Emerald?"
"Please tell me you‚Äôll make more videos on this subject, this was very enjoyable to watch!"
As a physicist i appreciate those visualizations. This is truly remarkable content.
awesome video
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m13s"">4:13</a> yeah, I think I did that twice as a kid."
I don‚Äôt have anything cool to say but I want more people to see this so Imma comment for the algorithm
This guys is smurfing youtube
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=6m52s"">6:52</a> I love it&#39;s little celebratory dance after it wins"
Great video Peter! Excited to see what else you entertain us with in the future.
"The first 5 minutes was you explaining how you programmed an AI with ADHD.<br><br>Finally, a computer i can relate to."
The army of AI players reminds me of the NPCs trying to live in their peaceful world but suddenly the player is awakened and the game becomes the hit game that it is. It‚Äôs a pretty accurate visual representation I feel even describing like MMO npcs. <br><br>Luckily the Pokemon world isn‚Äôt so bad to be stuck in. The player doesn‚Äôt doom the universe and things are generally pretty happy. There‚Äôs even areas to explore. You could do much worse for a universe to be stuck in.
The magicarp man is ronald mcdonald ‚úÖÔ∏è
Awesome video and explanation! It‚Äôs incredible to watch the AI learn how to navigate and play the game.
reinforced learning is like bribing it to play
This needs more views
If you‚Äôve ever played a game in Japanese you are AI training yourself and doing runs like selecting the move with no pp left. Because you can‚Äôt understand what it‚Äôs saying. Kind of interesting to think about.
sick project.
nice job
Another challenge would be teaching the AI pokemon well enough to give it a softlock challenge and have it escape.
"First time I&#39;ve ever subscribed to a channel with 1 video. I love this.<br><br>I&#39;ve thought about how difficult it would be to accomplish something like this just because of all the weird flags that Pokemon asks of the player throughout the journey, but it seems like this is able to accomplish a lot of the basics without any special coding to ensure it hits certain flags. Very impressive, and there would definitely be a lot more complicated obstacles getting the AI even further into this game, so I&#39;m not too shocked that the journey ends at Mt Moon."
The overlaid progress animations are utterly mesmerising to watch!
This doesn‚Äôt have 1 million views and at least 20k likes??? A crime I say! <br><br>Amazing video. Brings me back to my childhood and keeps me in present time with the AI. üëç
When the researchers on cinnabar island told me as a kid to check back later I battles in the mansion for hours waiting for them. I became suspicious when I came back and they were coincidentally done. It was at that moment I realized that games lie! <br><br>Oddly time was the main feature of the next game.
i am concerned with the trend of anthropomorphising computer programmes
I&#39;m surprised that the AI does not exploit the pokemon level reward. As the change in level is only counted when it is positive it could deposit a pokemon without penalty and then retrieve it to get the reward. It could do this over and over agian.
Super interesting
"For someone who&#39;s never coded anything in his life, save a couple of &#39;tutorials&#39; which were just copying word for word stuff, how easy would this be to use?"
"Veeery well made video, thanks a lot!!"
check out the blind and deaf runs for a human developed algorithm for beating pokemon games
it&#39;d be really interesting to see something like this with maybe genesis sonic games or nes/snes mario games
So interesting and the edit and story telling was really well done. Big subs üíñ
"i absolutely adore the AI submitting one pokemon into the PC, having a panic attack and then never going to a pokemon center again. it&#39;s extremely funny"
This deserves a million views. Gosh darn. Rng manip?? Im human and can&#39;t do that!
what a banger video and your first aswell !!  looking forwards for some more gems to come by
Absolutely love this! Would love to see it &#39;beat the game&#39; and would love to see which &#39;paths&#39; it takes to get there
AMAZING PRODUCTION 10/10 the whole video was great.
Only 1 video and I love this channel.  Will be sharing this video with as many people as I can and I hope we&#39;ll eventually see either more Pokemon Red videos following the progress of this AI or other videos in a similar style.  Everything from the script to the visual and production value is so well polished and professional.   Keep it up!
"Felt bad for the AI that was punished for depositing a pokemon, which caused it to have a breakdown."
Here before 100k views
I like this but it was kind of heartbreaking when you saw that it was having too much fun watching the scenery and basically made it easier to bore<br><br>You took its enlightenment away
This is insanity ü§£ I love it. Thank you so much for making this public!
1 minute into the video and I&#39;m already impressed by the editing of the video
All the little dudes walking around in a giant version of the map is such a cool visual.
The Self-Replicating Reds have breached containment. The Pokeworld is doomed.
"excellent video, by any chance do you use blue switches on your mechanical keyboard?"
I was here when this was the first video of the channel!
"Cool video! A few follow up questions: if the AI prioritizes levels, why doesn&#39;t it immediately fill its party before the level 5 magikarp is available?<br><br>The RNG info was really cool. I would be curious to hear more about how the AI is set up and how it is &quot;storing&quot; this information. I guess perhaps there was one iteration where this happened and it was so beneficial that it was built into future generations to respond in the same way to those same exact situations?<br><br>I would be curious to hear information about rewards that completely broke it. Once I saw that winning battles and maximizing levels was important I expected the AI to get into a final state where it stays and keeps grinding for XP<br><br>Was there a reward built in for getting gym badges. I would be curious to see how that works. I guess maybe the reward already built into the system is it lets you go to new places<br><br>How did the AI know it was out of PP? Was it able to read those memory values?<br><br>With access to memory values it would be interesting to see a version where all major story points have rewards that give the AI more guidance like &quot;get pokeflute&quot; &quot;play poke flute in location&quot; to see if it would be possible to win the game."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m00s"">4:00</a> is such a mood"
Amazing video. The quality is off the charts!
I wanna see how the AI would do if it had all the information learned form all the pokemon games. see what kind of teams it would use when it has the entire 9 gens optimized.
You are personifying this wayyyy too much!
"This was incredibly interesting, but I would love to see the optimizing the AI by giving it rewards based on what a real player would prioritize. Things like how much HP/PP is remaining, type match ups, utilizing STAB when effective, routing (learning when to grind and when to proceed), etc.<br><br>This video covers very high level aspects of these concepts (Explore, Win, Catch/Train), but with a more thorough breakdown of those concepts the AI could become truly impressive overtime"
I‚Äôm very interested on how you got the birdeye view shot with all the ai attempts. That is SO COOL
Absolutely banger video that both kept me entertained and learning. <br><br>Wonderful Job.
What a great video!!
"Damn, bro came out of nowhere with a banger!"
This is amazing
"I&#39;m surprised the AI did not start depositing and withdrawing pokemon in a loop for infinite reward points after only giving points for increased levels.<br><br>But the biggest problem is there are no negative rewards meaning it doesnt see a difference between taking 5 minutes or 5 hours to beat the first gym battle, or doing nothing at all (you can see a lot of runs standing still for a long time)."
Is this really your first video?! This is incredibly well done. So glad YT has recognized that your content is deserving of being pushed algorithmically.
"Great job, I&#39;d love to see a part 2 of the AI going beyond Mt. Moon."
"I don&#39;t think the human behavior comparisons were compelling. You can easily cherry pick the actions of anything to construct some vague moral or reality to the same effect, so it doesn&#39;t feel meaningful. It also split up portions of the video I was interested in. The visuals and concept of the video were interesting otherwise"
I wanna see what happens when it runs into missingno
been working on the same project for a minute. Why compare screens when you can just use the map number and player coordinates to determine if you are in a new spot. Way less overhead
"Amazing video! RL is often very difficult to implement in practice, and RL people are often scientists without the engineering skills to start to implement solutions alone. Even just encouraging exploration here was not straightforward. Would be interesting to feed the ai some human gameplay to start, but one souldnt be able to generate much data like that manually"
I&#39;m only 5 minutes in but get already say this is a really interesting and well produced video.
"I‚Äôm still watching the video but one thing that interests me about this is that it (unintentionally, I think) showcases how unprepared humanity is for the proliferation of AI - let alone self-sustaining AI.<br><br>This is not a knock on the incredible program you put together here. I‚Äôm just thinking about how much we needed to tweak and change things because behavior did not go as intended. Basically, no matter what our intentions may be, the execution can go completely differently. Think about the amount of tweaking it took just to get the AI to go to Pewter, or even to leave Pallet Town.<br><br>I imagine if we implemented AI to solve major world issues (eg climate change), we risk having far more catastrophic results than our good intentions anticipated.<br><br>This isn‚Äôt to ‚Äúwax alarmist‚Äù about AI. It‚Äôs more an observation that I‚Äôm making.<br><br>Really amazing video"
Extremely well-made video!
I read papers that weren¬¥t as well thought out
this could be a thesis
Yooooo this video is insane. Can&#39;t wait to see the algorithm really run with it
:0 :)!
"I think buying the Magicarp is perfectly in line with the goal. Gotta catch &#39;em all, after all."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=14m14s"">14:14</a> no, we didn&#39;t &quot;evolve&quot; these traits."
Truly showing that if you put together a good video you are going to get views
Bro gave an AI PTSD from using a <i>computer</i> .
"I&#39;m only like 9 minutes in but I have to say I can&#39;t imagine how long this took to edit. <br><br>I was on Twitter Plays Pok√©mon when that was going on and we had a good like 11000 frames in the final play through video completely shuffled due to a couple game resets that reset the frame order, that I manually put back together for an upload and that was just for the duration of most of mt moon.<br><br>I imagine for videos like this it helps to be good at python."
"Ze Pokemons, zer here!"
Would be nice if you could make another video(s ?) where it continues playing the game and eventually finishes it.:)
I&#39;d love to see someone do this with a deep learning model that already has a conceptual understanding of the world.
I guess that Magikarp salesman had the last laugh after all.
I love how the AI just decided &quot;nope magikarp is garbage&quot; <br><br>Then proceeds to run from matches no matter if they&#39;re wild or trainer battles.
This is honestly amazing. Instant sub üëçüèΩ
i want to see it complete the pokedex
"YO the visuals and quality of everything in this video are wild! I could not ramble long enough to explain everything I love about it. The diagrams, explanations, overlapping AI attempts, just AAAA. AI videos like this are an amazing experience to watch, but imagine very difficult to make and monitor. It was wild seeing that this was your first video on a now 2k sub channel. <br><br>Seeing it learn was also nostalgic to a degree. You could really feel its ‚Äòpersonality‚Äô by the end. Seeing its trials, learning behaviors, and what it was capable of was such a journey. <br><br>I can‚Äôt wait to watch your channel grow!"
"Great video, by which I mean you did an awesome job on this project AND you told the story of what you did in this medium in an awesome way. You could absolutely have a very successful youtube channel if you keep this up!"
This is excellent
Dude this is so impressive! Are you a CS or data science student? What a great thing to add to a portfolio..
Phenomenal video. Please keep making more! :)
The AI is a massive Squirtle fan
"Excellent content, bro! It was extremely interesting to learn about how AI has progressed and how rewards had to be adjusted over time. The way you structured the video and the visuals was astounding. Keep up the good work!"
I‚Äôve been waiting for someone to do this with an FPS shooter or Super Mario 64.
"wowm can you do it but this time the ai is trying to speedrun the game, so idk how, but you give it some point when it go fast to do thing ?"
What is the single least stepped on tile?
Very interesting watch! Cute but also haunting when it seemed to develop trauma...
"I wonder how different it would be if there was three AI working together instead of just one, one for navigating the overworld, one for wild battles, and one for trainer battles."
"I always thought that making the ia building his own map (rewarding it each times its map grow), making it flag every different tiles and entities and testing every possible interactions with that tile/entity (to applie positive or negative reward for each different interactions with that) then when the ia encounter a new tile that is identical to one that it already know, it can anticipate if it is beneficial or not to interact with it... also, it would make the ia choosing a path toward a goal instead of running randomly until it find something interesting...<br><br>Most of ia related videos that i have seen so far makes the ia run like a blind man in a labyrinth and compile the rewards only at the end of the run... it should be able to get its reward in real time... so for example, when it did deposit its pidgy in the pokecenter pc, it should have seen it as a bad thing after doing it... but it should have search all other commands in that pc in order to be rewarded for doing something new... to discover that it is possible to retrive its pokemon... in that case, it would not have been afraid of pokecenters but just afraid of the interaction in the pc that say &quot;release pokemon&quot;... the ia did get afraid of the pokecenter because it said: in that place, i lost a lot of points, so it is bad to go there... instead of saying: choosing the interaction labled &quot;release pokemon&quot; with that entity is bad... <br><br>Giving it a full memory of what it did and the consequences of each actions and making it build its own map and label everything and recall its data in the next run should increase drasticaly its learning process as it would now know where there is passable floors and where are the tiles that have interactions...  the first run should be messy for each times it find something new... but would fly like a rocket when it know the place..."
Making such an amazing video and uploading it and the code for free is super classy - Thank you Peter!
"Artificial curiosity is such a fascinating rabbit hole. Was going to comment about that before I even watched, so glad you touched on it so much.<br><br>There was this research project that did much the same with navigating a maze. It was simply taught to seek new information until it found the exit. Simple and flawless, right? Well it DID work perfectly... until the researchers added a TV on the wall. Therefore new information to infinity... never looked away, never finished the maze."
Looks like ants
great video
"I‚Äôm very, VERY interested in seeing the AI attempt to handle acquiring HM01 and learning what to do with it. It seems insurmountable, and also I think if the AI discovers that Cut works on grass tiles, it will fixate on the ability to generate ‚Äúnew‚Äù areas."
Amazing content! I&#39;m very excited to see the results of further training
I think the novelty search algorithm would be the best fitness function for a game like this
The AI continuously chooses to move right at all new settings because the first thing it had to do to get a large reward was to move right toward the starter pokemon.
"Gotta say, I do not like or comment very often but they way you link ai and human behaivor together is nothing short of beautiful."
All fun and games until it learns to use ACE to do a sandbox escape out of the emulator to grant itself infinite reward.
"I&#39;m loving this, please keep up the good work!"
"Best video on RL i have seen.  The fact Gen1 Pokemon is my favorite game only made it better.  Thanks so much far sharing the code, i will be looking at that!"
"The AI is cool and all, lots of comments discussing it, but. I just wanna say, the editing is so awesome for a video like these, you don&#39;t often see such excellent presentation"
This is your first video?! Starting as a masterü§Ø Definitely excited to see what you&#39;ll make in the future!
Why does it only pick Squirlte each time?
this video was incredibly made you deserve more subscribers
Holy shit! 5 YEARS?! Amazing job man!! üî•
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m13s"">4:13</a> that took a dark turn üíÄüíÄ"
I want to learn to do this
"This, uh, kicks ass"
"I&#39;ve wanted to see this exact type of experiment for so long, amazing effort and video! : )"
No way this is your first video. The shifting multiple perspectives at once is so well done.
How many image seq does it take? What NNs do you use? And do you use the stock CLIP encoder?
amazing work. This is a really well done. I hope the algorithm gods bless you
Bro you have a twitch goldmine on your hands if you found a way to stream the AI learning how to play
"I&#39;m very much a beginner coder, and I will not be delving into AI at all in the near future, but this was interesting nevertheless!"
"&quot;Just hanging out and admiring the scenery is more rewarding than exploring the world.&quot; Damn, that&#39;s such a mood. I relate with the AI at that point in its learning. XD"
"how would item management and Pok√©mon management work? like learning necessary hms (or using items like antidote, or rare candy, selling nuggets), or trading Pok√©mon in the PC for a more optimal team. I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re not going to want to hard code that. you did mention other models that are in development. This is exciting."
"Why would you go with Red, instead of Yellow though?"
super interesting ty for sharing
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m00s"">4:00</a> minutes I learned you gave the AI ADHD and I&#39;m in love with this lmfao"
I think the philosophical discussion was kinda silly but overall great video!
Very interesting! Where did you learn all these tools? Is there a specific orders?
yes finally I&#39;ve been waiting for this. literally since like 2015
Imagine the AI finds a mew under the truck ü§£
you need more subs. i want you to be successful.
those gameboy screen pictures in the interludes are georgeous
I find it poetic that the most simple version of the AI decided to simply enjoy the subtle nuances of their front yard
"This is really cool to see!<br>If you&#39;re already reading some data from the game&#39;s RAM to get information like Pokemon Levels, would it be possible for you to get the player&#39;s position in the overworld and reward the AI for stepping onto tiles it&#39;s never been on before? This could potentially solve the issue at Mt. Moon, where it gets stuck because of the similar visual layout."
"Damn, I literally just had this idea a few days ago and now this pops up in my recommended lmao. Great work!"
Awesome Video! I watched it in one sitting. How did you do the visualisation? Really eyecatching
Dude we need 2nd gen and beyond.  Would love to see the AI encounter a shiny!
I am surprised you never had or even mentioned any kind of negative reward just for existing. Like every 24 frames is -1. You would need to massively increase all the rewards to make sure doing nothing is never the best choice but by forcing it to be efficient I imagine it would make things smoother overall.
"I 100% expected you to have at least a few other videos given your expertise of presentation, cheers man! Really informative and cool video with a neat premise and analysis, keep up the good work!"
"Do you have a full image of the kanto region layed out like that in high quality? I&#39;m currently building the region in minecraft, and would love to use it as a reference!"
"One way you could incur exploration, and possibly have it learn faster, is to punish it for doing moves that doesn&#39;t visually change the screen in any way (walking into a wall, standing still)"
"I really want to see the algorithm get past Mt Moon. Rather than reward the AI based on &quot;seen&quot; screens, would making the reward look at changes in the in-game cooridinates potentially get it further?"
You had me at &quot;encouraged it for finding new parts of the game and seek out novelty&quot;
"This video could have been so sick if it were 5 mins long, straight to the point, and you didn&#39;t immediately make me click off at the beginning when you said this machine learning algorithm for a children&#39;s video game has something greater to teach us about ourselves.<br><br>You managed to check off all the hallmarks of a sappy youtube video essay one minute in to the video."
AMAZING
This is something I would expect to see in a college course. This is an awesome video
Incredible work. The editing is fantastic!
This was such an interesting watch. It was so funny to see that the AI just stopped using Pokecenters due to legitimate PTSD.
Great video my man. Id love to see you do this all the way to the end if the community can help pay for it!
"This is a very interesting video and I appreciate the effort put into it. However, I feel that this wasn&#39;t handled very logically. <br><br>First of all, you never really defined your actual end goal. If it&#39;s just to see the credits screen then really what you should have done is listed that as your reward. Technically that&#39;s already a valid ML program that will eventually give you what you want. Of course it would take forever, so realistically you&#39;d have to work backwards and define every hard requirement needed to see the credits screen, such as:<br>- Get all gym badges<br>- Visit certain towns<br>- Talk to certain NPCs<br>- Get certain HMs<br>- etc...<br><br>Once you&#39;ve listed every single hard requirement you can think of in terms of seeing the credits screen, you have yourself a legitimate reinforcement learning program. Instead you seem to have imperatively listed off things that came to mind to help the AI, but that&#39;s not how ML really works because the whole point is that it&#39;s fairly unpredictable and you&#39;re not supposed to try to micromanage it. You saw many issues with this, like how depositing pokemon gave it negative feedback. <br><br>You should really be thinking about this declaratively and merely listing off hard requirements for your explicit goal. Having high level pokemon in your party has really nothing to do with beating the game and you&#39;ll see speedrunners not caring about things like health or levels as much as you might think.<br><br>With that being said, I think you could make a very interesting series of videos, similar to Jrose11&#39;s videos, if you came up with certain challenges and properly defined what it is you want the AI to do with minimal handholding. That would be incredibly interesting and could likely be useful in creating games as well. I look forward to future videos."
"this video is so well done, i love it. i don&#39;t even care what you are talking about."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=11m45s"">11:45</a> this entire situation reminds me of the kid who couldn&#39;t beat the original Super Mario because he never learned that A makes you jump xD suddenly the whole world of experiences opens up!"
"What a great explanatory video, and a delight to follow the journey!  I particularly loved the visualizations you created and walked us through - thanks!"
Great vid I want to see more of the game played through
Masterclass
"you call magikarp a cheap junk pokemon, i call it a gyarados before misty&#39;s gym"
Is this video part of a PhD or research? Because at the very least it would likely qualify for publication in quite a few journals
This video is excellent! Keep up the good work!
This is so random but I recognized your name cause we emailed once like a year ago because of growing NCA. This is such a difficult game to train an RL agent on. You&#39;re a real galaxy brain my dude.
"I don&#39;t know much about AI and programming but I&#39;ve always watched YouTube videos on it, and this is definitely one of my favourites. Pok√©mon a game I love, and the video being high quality and detailed, learnt a lot from it and the AI was being so funny in a lot of places"
Literally the most fascinating video I have watched in a long time on YouTube. Keep it up!
"This is great, I&#39;ve never watched anything this involved about AI but I can&#39;t stop watching."
This is really great stuff man. Thank you for making this. I love Pokemon and I love seeing how AI stuff works.
"While I really enjoy watching videos from new creators, it always leaves me hungering for more"
"Remember kids, when people talk about AI taking over the world, it might happen eventually, but right now it can&#39;t even get to Misty."
But does it become smart AI by the end of it??
"Seeing a lot of comments from AI researchers praising your technique, but as an absolute moron who knows nothing about programming, I appreciate how clear your explanations are. This video is fantastic"
Why reset the model after every change? Our life experiences are not reproducible and (hopefully) we learn <i>lessons</i> to update what we find rewarding as well as randomly trying not to die.
awesome vid
It&#39;s like watching ants
"Hope this blows up even more, it&#39;s super interesting. Wild how the AI caught on to the deterministic rng gen so it could guarantee a catch on every run!<br>Also insanely good editing and visualizations that make this such a fun and interesting watch."
I&#39;m at the section about how the AI develops trauma from pokemon centers and that is incredible. That is such an interesting programming quirk.<br><br>I wonder if the AI would ever develop the ability to find the Missingno Glitch. The Missingno Glitch allows pokemon to be above level 100 which would be a massive spike of rewards for the AI.
If you actually want to obtain the game legally legally there is a gameboy cartridge slot for PC which can dump games called the GB Operator.<br>It&#39;s pretty good.
Want you to continue this to see if it can beat the elite four lol
oh man. i&#39;ve been waiting for something like this. didn&#39;t watch the video yet
"Wow, I&#39;m 3 minutes in and this is an insane first video. Your presentation is top-notch, far above most other YouTubers who have dozens of videos under their belt. I love the transitions, showing of the screens, the presentation of the reward mechanics. Your voice over has no issues, the mixing is perfect. Not to mention this is a fascinating topic for me. This is what YouTube was made for.<br><br>Yeah, after watching the rest, this is a masterpiece. Hopefully you continue to put videos up, I would gladly contribute to a Patreon."
Holy crap this video is so well made!
Very interesting
well i now know what i‚Äôm gonna be doing during my free time when not doing work for my phd. i‚Äôm gonna tinker with the training functions too and see if i can get this to the elite four somehow. will update this post as i go haha
"You should publish this academically, excellent work"
"Wait what, this is your first video? Randomly found this, but this is extremely well done for such a small account, congrats!"
I remember back when there were 1 or 2 reinforcement learning videos on YT.<br>Now we get all sorts.<br>But this one...this one is special. The production value here is excellent.<br>Thanks for all of your hard work.
This was such an interesting watch
Awesome video and best of all a linked github repo.  Thank you
you should use Markov Chain math to show hotspots where agent spends most of its time on average
I&#39;m kind of invested in this AI&#39;s journey to become Pokemon Champion now
this is a epic ah video
Can&#39;t wait to watch this video and see how the ai beats the game by using completely stupid means or some strats so sick that will rewrite the story of how this game is supposed to be played
but is it gonna beat the game :(
"GREAT video! Very fun to watch and informative on top of that.<br><br>Besides RNG manipulation, I wonder if the AI could also stumble unto memory manipulation, like manipulating encounters to include pokemon normally not encountered by influencing the game memory.<br>I&#39;m not sure on the specifics but there are a few well known manipulations even shared on school playgrounds back in the day (like Missingno) that the AI could potentially discover.<br><br>What do you guys think?"
The Ai getting PTSD from the hospital.
I‚Äôm very invested in this. Can it be a series? I would pay a subscription for weekly updates on the progress. Fantastic work!
god is real
Omg seeing the Ai playing and seeing a hole bunch of them is so amazing and satisfying
they are like ants to me
The Pokemon Center trauma actually made me laugh out loud. This is a really good video.
This is crazy high quality
"So what youre telling me is<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m22s"">4:22</a> you let an AI think????"
"Commenting to feed the algorithm for you. The presentation of this video is very satisfying to watch, your efforts should be rewarded!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=10m38s"">10:38</a> this is the BEST kind of ant farm imo"
Do this with the radical red romhack‚Ä¶ i wonder if it can beat the game at all..
"I don&#39;t think it&#39;s mentioned, but I think it&#39;s interesting how your setup worked. You specifically started the AI after getting the Pokedex, meaning it skipped over needing to interact with the process of getting the Parcel from the PokeMart, returning to the Lab, and dealing with the Old Man as an obstacle. <br><br>This kind of relatively arbitrary obstacle is understandable to remove in this setting, but they  only become more and more common as the game progresses. Even if this edition of the AI could progress past Mt. Moon, it would certainly be doomed when trying to handle these kinds of story checkpoints like the Cerulean City police officer or fixing up Bill."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=7m29s"">7:29</a> I love this. What an amazing way to show tine lapsed progress! Also dope vid. I totally came in here with a video in mind to watch and this thumbnail said HAH YOU THOUGHT!"
awesome video. cant wait for what else youve got cooking up
"I&#39;m the kind of person to learn from working examples, tinkering, and breaking until I know enough to ask questions. Your work will help me get into this topic. Thank you!"
"First of all, congratulations on the simulation and the video. It&#39;s so hard to find someone who has both the technical capability on machine learning to pull off a project like this AND the storytelling capabilities to create an insightful video on it. <br><br>Second, I don&#39;t know if this project was a one off, if you&#39;re going into new projects or if you plan on advancing on this one, but if you do, I&#39;m sure your video will gain the attention of the Pokemon modder and content creator community, and with this you could partnership to get the resources necessary to run the simulation deeper, or even retrain your model from scratch with more fine-tuned rewards (specifically to avoid those zones in which the AI gets stuck on areas of the map that are too similar). <br><br>Best of luck! I hope you&#39;re successful on whichever your next project will be"
god id love to see a 24/7 livestream of something like this
What specs was the computer you used?<br>Im thinking of trying this on my own server and want to see roughly how my server would stack up against the original training computer.
"Is there a reason you couldn&#39;t add a time-limit for the exploration reward to encourage it to occasionally go back and explore areas it already has, thus getting it to go back to the starting town for progression later if you start it at the actual beginning?"
Please give the AI a new game to explore with less limits.
"Seeing as how the AI learned to actively avoid Pok√©mon Centers due to the initial oversight in the level reward function is just mind boggling yet makes total sense at the same time. The way you put it is perfect too, how it associates it with that negative reward, almost like tbe AI itself obtained PTSD. Its truly incredible how things like that can transpire in other beings, especially inorganic like this AI"
Bro this is your first YouTube video??? This is seriously amazing quality good job dude
It walked on the edges becauS that‚Äôs the best way to get the most new unique screens
"Fantastic! Refusing to press A after loosing the battle, denying a loss, lol same shit i did as a kid lol"
"incredible, but what was the AI final team?"
"Dude this is your first video? no way. <br><br>Fantastic, was hoping for more lol"
"It would be really cool to see someone take control of a run just to quickly introduce an idea or concept such as how to share EXP with Pokemon when they beat an enemy. Just to see what the program does with that information.<br><br>Imagine in a future MMORPG where a player builds this village where people have to traverse it through unorthodox means, like jumping around or Grapple hooks. Where NPCs watch the best ways to traverse the village from various players thus impacting their behavior as a result. Like Say a NPC witnesses how a player effortlessly traverses a village in the tree tops using a grapplehook so it decides that is how it wants to as well. So it creates a Quest for a player to get the NPC a grapplehook. Then More NPC&#39;s in the village see this, next thing you know, you see an entire jungle village where most NPC&#39;s are just swinging around the place.<br><br>And if that is possible, imagine what could be done with Enemy NPCs, without making the game impossible to play of course."
"Was this video a requirement for an AI class, you are in?<br><br>It was very well put together. I do like how you look for the reasons that the algorithm chose to do what it does."
this is really cool
"really love this content, thank you so mutch for it"
I laughed when the ai refused to press a button when it lost a battle. Just thought that was funny for some reason.
Anyone newer to Machine Learning: this video is such a great introduction to concepts such as:<br><br>* Reward Functions<br>* Misalignment<br>* Emergent Behaviour<br><br>And more!
"I was just thinking as I was watching, wouldn&#39;t it be lovely if it could build a mental map of the world as it explored and you could reward based on adding to that map and then at the end you mentioned the different optimized memory model options. Very cool stuff!"
This is one of the best vids I&#39;ve seen about AI and I&#39;m not joking. Thanks random anon.
The ai refusing to press A when it loses a battle and stalling forever is absolutely hilarious and almost feels weirdly human üòÇ
"the ai losing it&#39;s pokemon after messing around at the pc and getting mildly traumatized like a little kid who can&#39;t read yet to actually understand how the pc works and thinking they lost their pokemon forever got to me ngl. the little guy could have just withdrawn it, but it just didn&#39;t know..."
Amazing
"This was very cool to see. Does the AI take visual elements into consideration at all? In the sense that, for example, if it notices that door tiles in many cases lead to an unexplored area such as the inside of a house, does it start looking for those tiles specifically? Or is it purely going off of &#39;memory&#39; what sequence of button presses led to the highest number of objectives being satisfied?"
I wonder if we can teach it the type matchup table?
"Fantastic work man!! The idea is so cool and a fun exploration of machine learning through reinforcement learning and the reward function! <br><br>Not to mention, your video editing and visual storytelling skills are phenomenal! The visual representations you use flow super well and it was incredible to watch the AI play out all the different permutations, slowly improving over time. Seriously great work on this, it&#39;s an incredible case study."
The video was so good i want another with the ai finishing the game :o
I love the idea of there being an influx of thousands of trainers just casually strolling through the whole region originating from pallet town. Just like an unstoppable force of nature.
This is really impressive content if this is seriously the first video you&#39;ve ever made. Good shit
"This video is great! I have one suggestion though. At around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=16m33s"">16:33</a> the music is too loud and it makes it hard for me to understand what you are saying. I have an audio processing disorder. Early on in the video the audio is perfect"
"this peter dude has got this youtube shit, this was an impressive watch!"
"I would&#39;ve been more impressed if the AI started to fix alot of it&#39;s problems automatically for example the leveling problem. Eventually getting so far that it couldn&#39;t progress cause it had NOT leveled up is a problem some people actually face--- so it would&#39;ve been interesting seeing the AI reach that and see ok, would they speed run getting by just BARELY with just enough levels--- oooor would they had over leveled constantly.<br><br>Even so This is pretty interesting, and if simulated right it can really be used to maybe test run alot of things  ranging from video game bugs to personal safety if it can simulate so many different things and try them."
"They look like little ants, they&#39;re so cute!<br><br>Also, i wonder if they would have come back to Pallet Town if you&#39;d somehow used a large language model to interpret NPC dialogue and somehow use that to determine inputs?<br><br>Also it might become more intelligent if you have a battle AI separate from a pathfinder AI and have a supervisor AI that determines what state it is in"
"These projects always baffle me. Using reinforcement learning for training a gaming AI seems like an excellent proof of concept, but in practice every project you see has a somewhat unrealistic premise: you can only be truly ignorant of games once. <br><br>Game design has always been an iterative field. For every pokemon, there is a zelda that came before it. Both being top down rpg adventures, there are many skills that can be translated across the two. The project i really think is novel is an ai that gets trained across multiple games, with the goal of seeing how much quicker (if at all) it can learn a new title. Or, to train an initial game, then train it in other related games, then send it back to the first. <br><br>Dont get me wrong, this is really cool! I just wonder at the premise of training a general purpose ai."
Keep em coming this is an awesome first video üôèüôè
this is your first video?
50k hours?! You mean 20 years?!
I would love to see what it took to get the AI to the end of the game.
I kind like the similarity between the ai&#39;s naming scheme and some friends I&#39;ve had. üòÖ <br>&quot;AAAAAAAAAA&quot;
I kind of want the AI where it hates the pokemon center. so you can train it to do a NO pokemoncenter run
This video was amazing and will go viral. Please keep going with this project!
I miss when this was all AI was
"Pokemon money is like yen, in which the numbers are a count by something more like a penny than a dollar. Magikarp cost 5 bucks lol."
I think people underestimate how big a part video games will play in teaching computers to think like humans
"I wonder if you could change the types of punishments inflicted instead of having all punishments registered as the same. Because the AI thinks it‚Äôs getting the dad belt every time it loses the gym battle and the depositing Pok√©mon thing is like it‚Äôs experiencing a camping trip in Moral Oral rather than it being moved back to the start. If there was a bit of a severity measurement to tell the ai exactly what punishment it is getting (rather than using a 1-100 scale) maybe this would work better, a way to differentiate that the punishment isn‚Äôt extreme but also a way to push for improvements ‚Äúhey, you‚Äôre stuck. I‚Äôm not beating you but can we get a move on?‚Äù Perhaps if the AI got no points or benefits at all when losing the battle but still registering it as a core memory? (But still have an incentive by creating a sort of larger-than-normal reward for beating the gym and also a maximum point count that it should strive to achieve overall)"
"Incredibly well put together and explained. I am baffled that this is your first video. <br>Follow this up with a part 2 (3,4,5) that progresses further and beats the game somehow and you&#39;ll have tens of thousands of subscribers in no time."
Teach the AI to have speed runner goals since it can spend its whole life playing just like a real speedrunner
Would it theoretically be universal for all Pok√©mon games ?
the tech stuff was cool enough. was not expecting the philosophical aspects as well lol. cool vid.
The algorithm has bestowed its favor upon you this day. Praise be to the algorithm.
AI midlife crisis.
mom i think ai is taking over earth
"Interesting video, but I noticed that you started after getting the Pokedex. I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s just for simplicity&#39;s sake and time efficiency, but it would be interesting to see it &quot;figure out&quot; that it needs to backtrack."
Ai slowly taking over.
"Great video, I don&#39;t really get the metaphorical comments trying to link our modern day issues to AI, but other than that, this was a very interesting experience, and I can&#39;t wait for the part 2 if you ever make that."
"Very nice explanations. Followed. Hope to see more.<br><br>The trauma bit was extremely interesting, I haven&#39;t seen this in other AIs yet."
Awesome video! I‚Äôd love to see AI beat the entire game and come up with some wacky teams someday
How many fucking ways are there to beat Gen 1? I swear to god
"Very nice analysis, and great visualization!<br><br>I tried to run a few RL experiments in the past myself, but I think it&#39;s time to admit I need to copy and track others experiments first. Yours looks like one of the best home-brewn experiments I&#39;ve ever seen.<br><br>During the video, I noticed that the choice of moves and Pokemon is pretty much blind. Seeing the preprocessed input at the end told me why üòÇ"
the AI refusing to press a button when it&#39;s going to lose is so funny üíÄ
Training the IA to train the trainer training pokemons
"It would be great to allow AI to read the text too and understand the context. That may speed up the learning.<br><br>Seriously, if possible, please allow for NLP!!! Imagine, it could learn if a move isn&#39;t effective and know where to go next and what to do next!!"
Excellent first video. Looking forward to the whole game being done by AI
Extremely cool
impressive project!
The parts where we just get to watch the hundreds of bots move around lights up the single neuron in my brain dedicated to ChuChu Rocket.
"Awesome video.  Combining Pokemon with AI learning process.  Two of my favorite things, you got a new subscriber!"
You should coordinate with gymtrainer Matt. He has a custom ROM and overlay with lots of individual pokemon stats that you could feed into the AI through the same visual memory.
Now I‚Äôm curious about HM use ü§î
Holy cow it learned about rng manipulation?!?!?!? Wild
This AI Changed the meaning of trauma center entirely
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=0m55s"">0:55</a> &quot;iT tUrNs OuT sTuDyInG aN AlGoRItHiM cAn TeAcH uS a LoT aBoUt OuRsElVeS&quot; <br>Down voted. Turned off the video."
"The AI mashing buttons at the PC, depositing it&#39;s only healthy pokemon and then blacking out and chosing to blame the pokemon centre sure is the moment ever."
So I never used to buy the Magikarp because I knew I could get it for free later. But playing the game is an adult. I always buy the Magikarp and power level it because Gyarados with dragon rage absolutely wrecks for the next two or three gyms. It&#39;s also a great way to catch pok√©mon because it&#39;s a set damage move later on when they have more than 40 HP. Absolutely hilarious to me. How it goes about making these decisions. I wonder if you gave it a reward for choosing super effective moves outright as opposed to just winning battles if it would have figured out bubble sooner.
"Great video, would absolutely watch more of this content. It&#39;s wild how relatable the trauma was the AI experienced. Feel like I learned more about myself than AI."
"You could&#39;ve taken the average of the levels as the reward, this would fix many errors like the magikarp or depositing a pokemon"
"I think one way of improving the exploration rewards to make backtracking rewarding enough for the AI not to avoid, but also not something that would not easily get the AI into a loop would be to provide a reward when the banner telling you yoive entered a new area pops up as long as that banner wasnt the same as the two banners viewd before it to keep it feom getting rewarded for just continuously entering and exiting an area like Mt. Moon.<br><br>Couple that with the standard exploration reward, and discovering new areas would still be prioritized, but the AI would still find reason to explore when having to return to previously visited areas."
That was FASCINATING! Would it be possible to teach it type advantages? I&#39;d really like to see it play out all the way to the end as well. Overall this was a great video and I&#39;m hungry for more!
MAKE MORE
I love how you compared buying Magikarp to buying junk food
"&quot;Finally, after 300 days, it defeats Brocks&quot; xD"
When it lerned bubble it literally evolved
Add a few different rewards based on:<br>Team variability (different types)<br>The computer catches a pokemon it doesn&#39;t own already<br>Using a move that is super effective<br>Getting through an area quickly<br><br>I&#39;d love to see what happens then
This is top notch pokemon content
300 DAYS?! IT TOOK THIS AI ALMOST A YEAR TO BEAT THE FIRST GYM?!
This may be a dumb question because this is about reinforcement learning but can you show the AI specific runs like a world record speedrun and task it with doing the same but trying to optimize it or controling the AI personally to show it the advantages of super effective moves etc that may be a different rype of learning and not possible with this model but it just got me thinking anyways super interesting video keep up the great work
It got PTSD from the pokemon center im cryinggg üò≠üò≠
I have not got as far as coding or anything but this information really helps me with my own AI prompting. I really hope to do something like this in the future. Your video was very informative.
This is wild.  I really want to see more like this.  The parts about AI indulging in the Pallet town scenery and not using the Pok√©mon centre were fascinating. 10/10 concept and presentation.  liked and subbed!
Really interesting video. Good job!
Awesome video
This was an amazing project and explanation. You should submit this to The Journal of Geek Studies if you don&#39;t have a publication lined up already.
"meanwhile, the npcs in the game...<br>brock: Wow! That trainer took a lot of Benadryl..."
This video is soooo good . Thank you internet stranger! Looking forward to more
"How cool would it be to see a race between the AI playing pokemon and the project Twitch plays pokemon, to see who is faster, some monkeys or the AI"
"Funny thing, this is also how i played when i was a child"
"This is great! Commenting here for others visibility, keep it up!!!"
I can&#39;t wait to try this. How hardcoded is this to the game?
Having the technical information about how to run it was the cherry on top of the cake that is this project. Awesome stuff
"I&#39;ve wanted to do this for a long time. Ever since Sethbling&#39;s Mario neural network videos back in the day, I&#39;ve wanted to make an AI play Pokemon. <br><br>You actually did it and made a fantastic video in the process. Amazing work."
"The fact that 4 days ago you only had 60 subscribers, and now have 1.65 thousand... it&#39;s wonderful to see good content being found and rewarded. This is an excellent video, good job!"
exceptional video. you&#39;ve hit the ground running. so refreshing to see completely new channels with remarkably polished content.
This is hands down the best youtube video I&#39;ve seen this year.
Fantastically produced and really interesting concept. This is a really high level of polish for the first video in a channel!
"The AI learning Pokemon was quite interesting, but your comparison with human behaviour was quite stretched and shoehorned."
"Thank you for talking about the visualization aspects of the video. A lot of times videocreators leave that part out and as the lonesome automation-efficionado I am, I often assume people do these visualizations manually in video editing software. So glad to hear it was automated. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23faithinhumanityrestored"">#FaithInHumanityRestored</a>"
This has been something I&#39;ve wanted someone to do. The idea of an AI learning to play pokemon is so interesting. I would love to see this with another game.
Do you intend to take the AI all the way to the end of the game?
I&#39;ll sub on the first video that was excellent üëåüèº
"Great video, very high production value"
"Articulate, with great visual help and a bit of psychology to boot. Excellent job!"
How sad it took 60 lives for Ai to even get past pallet town. I only have one life and I‚Äôm already at Viridian City.
Algorithm.
Kinda creepy to think that you can traumatize an ai with an extreme reward penalty
What a spectacular first video on this channel
"Great video! Thanks for the deep technical dive, super interesting üòä"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=14m20s"">14:20</a><br>Bro just roasted humanity."
"Buys &quot;junk&quot; magikarp, evolves into Gyarados and crushes the game. Scary AI."
Wow. I had heard of ai training but never understood it. This explained it so well!!!
"what a great video! woud love to see it do a full run. very very well done, great story telling"
My favorite part was when the AI got so distraught after depositing a Pok√©mon that it passed out.
I want to see this in other generations too
"Dayum, this video is so immensely well made and laid out! I thought you&#39;d be a 6 digit subscriber channel by the sheer quality here, respect :)<br>Not only did you visualize all the data in an amazing way, you even explained how this all went together and what kind of effort went into it to create it all. I was quite interested how you gathered all the data and then put it together on a map, and even that was shown. More than blown away by all this!"
Wow. Subscriber earned.
Amazing video! The effort that went into this is obvious! I hope you make more videos!
Great project<br>awesome presentation<br>well done
"Excellent work, you should read the great &quot;Agent 57&quot; paper by OpenAI, implementing the techniques described there would greatly improve your agent. Also, how much hardware did you use?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=9m35s"">9:35</a> inb4 media says: &quot;AI played Pok√©mon, it was a traumatic experience&quot;"
"It&#39;s really interesting how many parallels there are between this AI learning to play, and me at 5 or 6 years old learning to play."
This is just so cool. Also loving the explanation with every problem you encountered with your reward system. It got my brain going trying to find a problem that could occur and how i would solve it. Good brain food video üòÖ
Great video
"i guess, giving incentive about how much % the player is from finishing the game, taking in account number of badges, catch pokemons, and story baseline, like number of dialogues for exmaple may help a lot"
Nature didnt select us and we did not evolve. Liked the rest of the video though.
great editing!
This was insane I would LOVE to see it finish the game
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=13m14s"">13:14</a> i found it cute when the ai started jumping down the ledge and going back up to do it again"
"Amazing video man! Well explained! I fully expected this to be made by a channel with hundreds of thousands of subscribers, I never thought it would a new channels first video! You earned a new subscriber man!"
Dude are you on r/grilledcheese?
YOU CAN GIVE AN AI TRAUMA
Well done!
I love this video! I find your way of approaching all the problems you faced very satisfying. It shows that you put a lot of thought into every decision and that you have the integrity and adherence to solve any problems in the most interesting ways. I&#39;m very glad that youtube understands my interests and the quality of this video enough to recommend it to me this early.
fantastic video<br>I find most videos on these ai projects focus WAY too much on the technical side when seeing it&#39;s behavior is far more interesting<br>backloading most of that was a great decision and the maps of the world were great as well
Please let the AI finish the game! It&#39;s trying so hard!
Fake
I don&#39;t know any Big Macs that turn into Filet Mignon at level 20.
I really enjoyed the first half of the video but my tiny pee brain couldn&#39;t follow the rest of it I&#39;d recommend leaving the smart person stuff for separate videos preferably on a second channel so that dummies like me leaving once they can no longer understand doesn&#39;t hurt your viewer retention I subscribed and want to see your videos do as well as you deserve because this video is extremely well madeüëç
I love the parallels you make with humans. It adds an educational twist to the video. If this video pops off you can pretty much guarantee it will inspire someone to go into AI or psychology.<br><br>There&#39;s probably a parallel to this with AI too.
It&#39;s very mesmerizing watching the overview of all the versions going around the game all at once like ants
If this video pays for itself you should do a part 2 that shit would be cool
"Man what i would really love to see was an ai fighting purely battles, not learning how to explore or whatever. <br><br>How long until it learns type matchups? which pokemon it starts to use? Maybe it will learn how to rng manipulate the rng in combat."
How about I just tell it what to do and call it a day? <br><br>Jk. Amazing video def a new subscriber
"i was thinking if you checked every 12 frames + looking at 6 frames might be enough for short term memory to explore caves n stuff, also give a reward for new items, and getting stronger moves / using stab"
Its interesting that the ai only ever caught nidoran female but never nidoran male
"YO the 1st time i played pokemon blue, i had no idea what i was doing and had a blastoise before i got out of the 1st cave üòÇüòÇü§Ø"
Great video!! I really enjoyed it. You&#39;ve put so much work into this. Looking forward for new videos
"Absolut wonderful Video, please continue this project"
This is sick. Earned my sub for sure.
Algorythm
"Would it be prudent to have two separate categories of rewards, those being permanent rewards, and reward subject to degradation over time? I&#39;m thinking about the weights and the objective of beating the game, and if beating a gym has a static weight it seems like there won&#39;t be much benefit in taking that over a reward that scales infinitely. By ramping up these rewards for each gym that its beat, it seems like the AI could be much more incentivized to make progress in that direction. Permanent rewards could be applied to visiting each uniquely named zones, too, and it seems like rewards in this fashion would discourage the AI staying in the same general place performing tasks to gain rewards for goals that are tertiary to completing the game. Having the degradation of impermanent rewards scale at higher values might also create more balance between permanent goals and impermanent rewards. I think this system of rewards might be conducive to achieve something closer to a speedrun."
Incredible video!
Never knew i would enjoy watching ai play pokemon<br>Great vid keep them coming<br>Subbed in hope for more ‚ù§
What I&#39;ve learnt is the AI is basically a distracted puppy
"Insta sub, great work. Actually way to much work. This has to skyrocket."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=17m25s"">17:25</a> I worked a lot with robotics, and a very common exploration algorithm is the &quot;wall follower&quot;. We learn it early, while also learning that using it will get your robot stuck üòÇüòÇ<br><br>Very interesting video."
"it took the AI 50k hours to beat Brock?<br><br>Wow.....Git gud scrub.<br><br>Jokes aside, this was a damn nice watch. Good stuff"
"This feels like teaching the most smart ass kid how to play the game: &quot;Penalty for loosing a battle? What if I never finish the battle, huh? Didn&#39;t think of that idiot, didn&#39;t you.&quot;"
"I had never heard of the reward system until now for AI. Very interesting. Even humans could be considered to be using a reward system when learning proper and improper behavior. The more complex the rewards system, the closer to human behavior you become."
I been wanting to do something like this but haven‚Äôt had time this is perfect
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=9m00s"">9:00</a> mins or so is only possible in Red/Green"
Broo how ca i learn this stuff
Algorithm booster
good video üëç
First vid on the channel hoping for more bc this was an incredibly made video and you definitely have an audience. Keep up the good work brother
"I would assume that the bias for counter clockwise exploration has some correlation to the very first area it begins in.<br>Since this is where it is exposed to the most, and learning how to escape that particular area will shape the majority of it&#39;s bias for movement.<br>Whatever movement progresses/rewards it the most from the starting point.<br>You might see a different pattern emerge if you start the area from a different point in the game with a save state or similar."
"Humans: AI will try and destroy us! AI: Nah bro. I wanna&#39; be the very best, like noone ever was..."
"Boosting algorithm, well deserved:)"
What hardware are you using to run this?
Super interesting video! üòÄ When my home-server is up I&#39;m gonna give it a try!
"Great Video, I have a feeling that visualizing the Maps and such was nearly as hard programming the training."
Commenting for the algorithm.  And because I want MORE! :)  This was awesome.  Well done!
Twitch plays Pokemon be like.
"This was fascinating to watch! I havent been able to focus on youtube in a while due to a recent physical disability, but this grabbed my attention and just wouldnt let go. So cool!!"
We all want to see it beating the Champ now from the real start :D <br><br>Really wonder if later fights influence the starter and you tell the AI to do something at the start different when it will only impact way later. (Will it even try?)
As a data science student and a hardcore pokemon fan i am amazed by yur talent and want to learn more from yu . I hope yu make more pokemon videos in future like this.
I wait for more videos üòÑ
"The YouTube algorithm has seen fit to bless your Pok√©mon algorithm, it seems!<br><br>But for real, this is a very well put together and nicely organized video, and I absolutely love the visualizations.<br><br>Out of curiosity... At what point does it make more sense to buy a Quadro of your own instead of renting server time? If this video cost over $1000, spending $2-4000 on a professional GPU and putting together your own server seems pretty sensible."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=4m14s"">4:14</a> I will never not see these sockets as worried faces"
comment for algorithm boosting
"One of the most impressive pokemon videos i‚Äôve seen in a while, 10/10 video! Hoping to see more content like this in the future. If you check ‚Äú40 cakes‚Äù on youtube, he has a 24/7 pokemon bot stream. Maybe you could do something similar as well, but with RL applied!"
holy shit cant imagine how long something with tthis instances must have taken to train
"Awesome stuff, and is an actual real application of AI unlike the Tomb Raider one haha"
Awsome Video i realy enyoyed watching &lt;3 <br>Is there any future plan for the AI too finish the game or is it too expensive? :(<br>I would love the AI too win against the Campion or seeing it trying too run from him with his lvl 5 Magikarp :D
"you just earned a sub, i can already tell this video is gonna pop off"
Really cool content here bro. Kinda looks like a virus shaped like ash has taken over the game.
"Did you consider giving your model a chance to do random actions? Think it would help to get some results faster (i.e. figuring out that using other moves than the primary one is good).<br><br>Nevertheless, great video overall!"
"Great vid but maybe slow down on the parallels with humans. It‚Äôs interesting but theres just too much of it in my opinion.<br>And also you could have the same amount of discussion if it was more segmented, the main annoying thing is constant change of topics for me, so having longer segments on each topic is what id recommend.<br>At the end of the day tho its your video and i really enjoyed it so good job!"
This is both fascinating and genius. Well done and thank you!
AI got traumatized with the pokemon center thinking it deletes its pokemon&#39;s lvls lol.
Here from the algo! Nice video! Very interesting.
&gt;AI obtains traumatic memory from depositing pokemon in a box<br>How very... familiar. <b>twitches</b>
This very interesting to see step by step. I&#39;d nearly want to do this myself!
"looking for pokemon content, found some preachy bullshit"
This is amazing Stuff! Great Work and fantastic documentation.
What an amazing video!
"So interesting, I can already think of some heuristics that might make the AI better (or worse)<br><br>Time since last reward -&gt; decay reward score over time so for example a level up reward might decay over 1,000,000 frames which encourages leveling up especially if no leveling has been achieved in a while this drives not having all level 100 pokemon in the party, or novelty reward decays over 100,000 frames so finding new areas is encouraged but it&#39;s not an overwhelming drive so revisiting areas isn&#39;t overly punished.<br>Catch&#39;em all -&gt; the sum of the highest level of each pokemon species in box/party encourages catch&#39;em all and even leveling up<br>Party Levels -&gt; the middle 4 pokemon levels are counted towards the score, lets players box their highest pokemon and bring out a much lower level pokemon without score cost<br>Healing -&gt; anything that increases the HP of the party gives a reward.<br>More game data -&gt; rather or as well as looking at the screen giving the AI co-ords might help with navigation in unfamiliar but repetitive locations, similarly for in battle giving access to pokemon and or move typing or just ID would allow the AI to learn about type advantages. Similarly knowing what pokemon are in the PC and at what levels with what moves could act as a pseudo memory for the AI and help with decision making like &#39;to evolve or not to evolve&#39;<br>Sequencing -&gt; there are several NPCs or objects that need to be interacted with in order to get to the end of the game, Oak, Pokemart, Oak, Brock, Rocket, Rival, Misty, Bill, etc, for each of these completed give a reward, for some it may be worth having rewards for going in the right direction, combine with a decay and there&#39;s a pressure to complete the game but it&#39;s not overwhelming and stops other pressures like leveling up.<br><br>Maybe save-state random starting locations, might encourage recovery, if a save state manages to make significant progress/gets a sequence reward then that save-state doesn&#39;t need to be trained on any more (unless it&#39;s the start of the game)<br><br>I&#39;d like to see this on Gen 2 (especially the Crystal Clear hack) with a goal of a living dex of level 100 pokemon... I think that as a goal would be easier to quantify progress to a living dex of level 100 pokemon than just beating the league and Crystal Clear is open world with fewer constraints on needing to do a sequence of things in the right order. But I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m ready to learn how to do any of this myself yet."
"I wanna see A.I. beat the game! Or maybe it plays gen 2? Eitherway, its awesome to see this, its so wholesome to watch the a.i. play"
"Very well made video, can‚Äôt wait to see what you do next!"
"Props to you! That was a pretty awesome project. Surprised by the amount of compute power required to train this, but I guess a lot of it is eaten up by the emulator."
Great video man
The challenge now is getting it to backtrack when it needs to.
20 seconds in and I&#39;m hooked
"Peter, the man we didn&#39;t know we needed"
Why not just use curiosity? Use one transformer for perception and reward another actor-critic transformer on a small (but not high) amount of perception prediction failure.
"The AI not progressing the battle after it lost, to technically not get a penalty is so funny to me."
hope you can do a follow up with what people have done with your Model
Comparing Magikarp to fastfood was just <b>chefs kiss</b>
"Ah yes, the issue of choosing the right reward for an algorithm. Personally, I&#39;d have added using Super-Effective moves as a reward."
This is awesome
Algorithm: [achieves enlightenment inside Pokemon Red] Humans: &quot;Well damn that won&#39;t work it&#39;s just admiring the scenery&quot;
Now THIS Is the kind of content I want to see recommended to me more frequently on YouTube!
"interesting, but stick to the AI - dont need constant segues to philosophize on the human condition<br>--<br>actually, it only happened a few times - otherwise, absolutely amazing"
Ooo
5 years?! Thats the dedication im looking for
Why the fuck did AI name the starter AAAAAAAAAAAAAA?
Plwease let it run. I wanna see the final team
"As someone with a music degree, I&#39;ve never felt more represented than seeing myself in the lower right of Pallet Town during the first few seconds of the video."
Hoping to see more like this. I subbed 5 min into the video.  Real quality stuff
"I haven‚Äôt seen the whole video yet, but in case it wasn‚Äôt solved, wouldn‚Äôt be an easy way to fix interest in battle and switching moves to reward the AI for using super-effective moves, or reward better the more of an HP bar is depleted?"
I know absolutely nothing about coding or algorithmic learning but this was very entertaining. Its always wild to see cool ass video ideas like this in my recommend attached to people with such low subs<br><br>You definitely deserve more! Would love to see the AI finish the game since things like proper item usage is basically nessicary for the elite 4
"Not that I don‚Äôt love the videos that just say ‚ÄúI applied an AI to this game and here‚Äôs how long it took to finish it‚Äù but this video (in addition to its high quality visuals and great script) is so much beyond that. <br><br>Instead of just watching a video on AI, we‚Äôre learning about reward implementation, the human condition, curiosity, and more and more. This went above and beyond, I was so rooting for our AI buddy by the end of this lol."
Very cool and entertaining üéâ
"I love the visualization of the whole map, It&#39;s so satisfying to look at"
"so glad to see someone really use the Real Game to train a AI for gameplay there are others but this ones special, choosing a RPG"
Gas
"I was pretty surprised this was your first video, and you&#39;re growing really fast, by the time I finished this video you&#39;re up almost 100 subscribers from when I started watching, I hope you make more videos, the editing and narration was really good, and overall it was a good video, you really deserve to be a bigger youtuber."
Bro this video is going to blow up. I&#39;m surprised it only has 13000 views right now
"great vid! thanks youtube algorithm, ya did your job!"
Great job! I hope you get lots of subscribers and people to help you with the project!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=3m40s"">3:40</a> I know a lot of ADHD people that where very much called out right here."
"Holy shit, how does this channel have less than 1k subs and puts out a video of THIS quality. Well done man!"
God i want to see it beat the whole game really bad
Super cool I&#39;d love to see it go farther
this is pretty interesting but it kinda felt like a CS major taking a philosophy minor
Little did I know I‚Äôd be confronted with my own humanity clicking on this video üòÇ
That&#39;s a W video.
I sense amazing things in your future. I imagine you will be having conversations with Bismuth for some reason.
"I see how backtracking would be a huge problem, but hey if TwitchPlaysPokemon did it anything is possible :D Have you considered rewarding the A.I. for the badges? That would function as a &quot;overall progression&quot; reward. Maybe it&#39;s too much of a long term?"
If nobody bothered playing the game then i can&#39;t be bothered watching this playthrough
COol!
Algorithm!
"That entire thing about putting Pokemon into a box reminded me of when my sister&#39;s friend borrowed me her Blue edition and i, unaware of how Pokecenters work, proceeded to Nuzlocke the game all the way to Misty."
"Ideas for rewards: gathering badges, super-effective attacks, consistency of hitting an attack<br><br>Ideas for punishments: fainting, not very effective attacks, missing an attack<br><br>Make every miss -1 and every hit +2; every not very effective attack -1 and super-effective attack +1 or something along those lines."
this is so neat. algorithm comment
Tldr the Ai played the game like a human
"The video is really well done, but honestly the &quot;inspirational&quot; parts made me cringe."
It gets distracted by scenery? Am I an AI?
"Whoa, it&#39;s incredible to me how high quality this video is compared to your sub number. If you continue with even  a fraction of the quality, you&#39;ll grow quickly for sure"
"cool video on my recommended feed. most &quot;game learning AI&quot; is purely driven by gamestate and data objectives, this put an interesting take on the subject by introducing a visual exploration reward. great approach for poking the computer forward with linear games like smb1, maybe not so strong for games with constant backtracking like metroid. the visualization of the AI optimizing its own route like a speedrunner would was very impressive. interested to hear more about your projects."
good job all around<br>you worked well here and it shows
"To be fair to the AI, I got lost in Mt Moon for what felt like a week when i first played the game üòÇ"
"Amazing work! It&#39;s super interesting to see all the little hiccups along the way, like the AI refusing to continue when losing a battle.<br><br>I&#39;d love to see a series of some sorts of this!"
Dude this is sick. I haven‚Äôt dug into any ML yet but this might be the catalyst for it.
What is the optimal tuna melt? Im a big fan of sharp cheddar with chunk light and kewpie on rye
I‚Äôve been blessed by the YouTube algorithm! Great video!
I wonder how the game would fare with a Randomizer of Red &amp; Blue.
This is outstanding!!!
Fastest subscribe ever. Please don&#39;t call into the trap of making videos quickly to &quot;appease the algorithm&quot;.<br><br>This is golden and probably took a LOT of time to create
Very epic
This is so sick
"You&#39;ve made a great video, keep up this level of quality and you&#39;ll make it big time."
"I think you would enjoy looking into differentiable neural computers, a form of long-term memory network created by DeepMind"
"Hey, I like this. If you need free server resources I am willing to let you use my server for free. I have a ryzen in it and are going to upgrade the CPU, although it runs OpenBSD, not linux. I have it on 24/7 so there is really no issue with that. I guess I can setup a linux VM for you. With multiple cores."
"Amazing Vid!!! Keep up the good work. I‚Äôd love to see the AI beat Lance, but I can only imagine the insane amount of work this already took to get to Brock."
"Pokemon red, great choice<br>Squirtle being the forced starter, we all make mistakes<br><br>Great video,  hope to see this in gen 2/3"
Great video!
Nice. Now go actually beat the game with this.
"This was incredible, keep it going!"
the imagery of thousands of children mindlessly wandering the region is oddly terrifying
"beautiful vid, easy sub sir<br>&lt;3"
Impressive results! Also very entertaining video. I&#39;m already hyped for your next ideas and experiments üòÑ
"Really impressive! I know I would have a hard time making an optimal decision given just one (or three) frames of Pokemon Red. If I&#39;m on the map, how do I even know if I should be backtracking or not? I would need some more memory so I knew where I was going.<br><br>What extra information did you give it more than the three latest screens? XP/Health/Status/PokemonID of your party would be useful of course. But since there is no other memory, the bot would want to see the item bags, the badges, the money, its current objective, what trainers it has fought, etc. to be able to play optimally. How much ram does a gameboy even have? Maybe it would be possible to give it the entire ram to view? Or maybe just what the savefile would look like if you saved right now? <br><br>Really nicely edited video too!"
Wow! Great video
"This is an amazing project. You‚Äôve outdone everyone‚Äôs capstone project in my data science bootcamp. Extremely well done.<br><br>Presented excellently. Executed effectively. The perfect package, really."
This needs so much more ciewership
Really interesting. I would LOVE to see this type of AI attempt a Nuzlocke
"Dear lord, this must have taken an insane amount of effort"
This is an incredible experiment. Just imagine if this model gets even better and several new rivals are created based on following the same journey as you. <br><br>I love that you included the ideas on how our minds can be quite similar to how AI Reinforcement Learning is established.
laughed so hard at the ai having a trauma part
I hope the ai is having fun
"Stick to the game, leave the oatmeal philosophy at the door. Thanks!"
I saw this pop up in my feed and then it disappeared. I had to spend so much time to find it. I&#39;m glad I did
The editing is awesome. Great job!
"why not deduct points at a maybe 0.005 scale based on missing hp and return them on healing so that healing them at the pokemon center becomes a huge reward when the hp is low but a minor reward when the hp is high? this might encourage it to care more about its pokemon without overwriting any of the other big rewards/losses, making exploration still desirable, but sometimes maybe it backtracks/enters a new pokecenter to heal.<br><br>this might also make it learn to use items"
"Ok but what if you trained a neural net to play Pokemon, but instead of giving it reinforcement based on actual gameplay you livestreamed it like Twitch Plays Pokemon and if it selects the same move as chat it gets rewarded. <br><br>Potential negatives:<br>Reduction in training efficiency<br>Limited correlation between actual gamestate and desired output<br><br>Potential positives:<br>Simple to implement reward function<br>Great video concept"
This video is great! Very interesting stuff.
Great video Peter Whideen!
"This is an amazing video, fascinating subject and experiment. Excited for whatever else you do in the future."
"this is phenomenal! amazing code, explanations and editing! keep it up!"
Looking forward to your future projects!
Its like raising a child
"Very compelling video. I really appreciated the details you went into, such as the AI becoming &quot;devastated&quot; after putting Pok√©mon in the PC.<br><br>This got me wondering if the AI behaves differently with a full party. Pok√©mon are sent to the PC when that happens, where its level supposedly wouldn&#39;t count. Furthermore, Pok√©mon don&#39;t gain exp when you catch a wild Pok√©mon. So would the AI learn to stop catching Pok√©mon?"
woah
its all fun and games until the AI names its party.<br>Let(Bulbasaur Lvl 8<br>Me(Mankey Lvl 3)<br>Out((Weedle Lvl 2)<br>Must(Ratatta Lvl 5)<br>Be(Pidgey Lvl 4)<br>Free(Ratatta Lvl 3)
this is so incredibly well done with some awesome visualizations. love getting recommended videos like this
"Great video, everything was explained very clearly and succinctly! Hope to see more in the future"
good video but the slidey transitions make me moiton sick haha
"when I opened this, you had 617 subscribers. holy jesus this is so professionally done."
comment for algorithm
This video is SO COOL! Keep up the great work!
Really really impressive. The effort for the visuals was well worth it! Didn&#39;t expect this to come from such a new channel.
What a wonderful video man
"Nice, I‚Äôm finding the biggest hurdle with RL projects to be getting an interface with a simulator working. Using an old game like pokemon which has thoroughly explored emulators sounds like a good idea. Are you a student?"
"wow, this is an insanely well made video."
Have the ai finish the game in a part 2!
Excellent video! I always love the videos where the AI attempts are overlapped. Makes me feel like I&#39;m staring at a bunch of newborn ants explore the world. Also the Pokemon center &quot;trauma&quot; moment was so cute! Poor AI!!! You didn&#39;t do anything wrong!!
"Honestly I hope your channel pops off, great video"
"Good job with the video. This was an interesting watch and I hope this video gets a ton more views for your channel&#39;s sake. <br><br>Some observations after watching this video:<br><br>After several iterations of having a human reconfigure the algorithm, it manages to complete a 10th of the game. What we actually have here is an example of why machine learning is not trustworthy. We can&#39;t always be sure what it&#39;s doing in the background without constantly observing the code running in real time. When we do observe it, we find it&#39;s doing exactly what it should be doing, according to the algorithm, but still unable to make it out of Pallet town. We found the same scenario when someone tried to make a skin cancer app using the same technology. The app started identifying rulers as skin cancer. The other issue with this is the shear amount of time it took to run this many iterations for something as simple as pokemon."
sweet vid bro
"Fantastic video. This deserves, and hopefully will get, 1,000,000+ views."
"Great job, I hope to see more projects like this with your high level of passion"
fantastic video i hope this gets traction.
it was unreasonably adorable when the AI stopped in Pallet Town to enjoy the scenery
PLEASE make a pt 2!! I would love to see the AI discover more advanced strategies.
"Very cool Peter. I have no experience with ML so this was informative and entertaining. Even got me reflecting on what my own reward system looks like and how it unconsciously shapes my behaviors. I&#39;d love to see where Transfer Learning could take this project, or whatever comes next!"
I feel bad for the ai when it deposited the pokemon. It was just trying to figure out the game and got traumatized by a computer
Commenting to please the algorithm gods.
Amazing. Seriously. Excited to see where this goes.
I&#39;m very impressed it&#39;s a interesting approach to the concept of a AI playing a video game.
amazing video
i snorted at &#39;obtain the rom.. legally.. you can do this on google--&#39;
"Amazing video, I can&#39;t describe how good this is! 10/10!"
"So high quality, thanks algorithm!!"
Cool video
can&#39;t wait until there&#39;s an ai that can take on the vgc ranked ladder
Algorithm found this. Doing my part to spread it more.
This was so interesting and really well explained!
"Gotta love how adverse the AI is to progression and the gameplay loop at the start when there is almost no rewards given, kind of like a hippie, this mirrors life too well"
Awesome video. Would love to see more!!
"Outstanding work! I&#39;m a sophomore studying computer science and I&#39;m interested in learning more about RL.  From a production and informative standpoint, this video is incredible. I thought about making a YouTube channel to document a couple of projects I&#39;ll make later on and this video shows how to make advanced CS topics more engaging. All the best for your journey as a developer and content creator in the future !"
Super good!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=3m50s"">3:50</a> &quot;Just hanging out and admiring the scenery is more rewarding&quot;"
"This video was overall really good, and besides commenting to make it so more people see this, I wanted to say that I think that you became a bit too eager to make comparisons of the ai and humans and I think you made some leap of logic which detracted from my enjoyment.<br>But even with that, great video! Hope to see more from this channel.<br><br>Also I think the audio mixing was a bit off in some parts, with the music a tad too high when compared to the voice-over, like at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=16m17s"">16:17</a>"
Great video!
"Even though I&#39;m not finished yet, it&#39;s an amazing video"
wow. What a great vid. Deserve more subs!
I hope we get more videos all the way to the Elite 4!
Would love to see AI try to learn Halo
This is amazing
Not even 5 minutes in and this video is already amazing. I look forward to seeing everything that you do. Such high quality animations and art in the video. Great job :)
Been waiting so long for someone to post a good attempt at this!
Cool video. Would love to see it beat the game.
Ai chooses to touch grass
This is so fantastically made and edited
Subscribed and shared!<br>Would you be able to experiment to see which AI can complete the game the fastest?
You and Pimanrules should collaborate!<br><br>Great video
This freaking rocks!
This video was great!!!
"This was so cool, man! Great work!"
So cool
that opening made me want a mmo rpg gen 1 or 2 Pokemon game. Awesome video
"loved this vid! I&#39;ve always been fascinated by how algorithms can end up cheesing certain rewards because of the way that it &quot;thinks&quot;, the fact that it decided to just stop playing if it ever lost a value to avoid the punishment was hilarious"
"Always pleased to be in on the ground floor of an amazing channel in the making<br><br>Thank you, YouTube algorithm<br>And thank you for the time you&#39;ve put into this"
this is an incredible presentation of very complex information in an easy to digest way. it felt so intricate but I was following along the whole time. this is an incredible and transformative exploration into what&#39;s possible with machine learning.
"Sorry, excuse me, HOW many subscribers do you have?? This video was SO HIGH QUALITY and well edited how do you have less than 500 subs"
"Wow, this is a really well put together and thought out video! Definitely deserves more attention, great work."
Why did the later iterations stop checking everything in Pallet Town? Wouldn&#39;t doing a single loop of Pallet Town be a pretty good way to see new areas?
Amazing video Peter. Keep up the good work. You&#39;ve earned yourself yet another sub. Can&#39;t wait for your future work

"Incredible video, instant subscribe. You deserve more attention!"
"a video made with excellent production quality, a very well spoken youtuber, great visualisation, an $1000 budget... this deserves to have a lot more views. definitely subscribing"
Cool video
"Yo this is a phenomenal effort, great job. Easy 6 figure salary as a ML eng or a YouTuber- your choice!"
I would love to see this taken further
Happy to be here at 5k views before it gets the 500k it deserves!
What software / program did you use to animate all the AI movements on top each other?
"Really wonderful! I did not finish the video (will do for sure,  tomorrow). Still, I would like to point one thing out: could you add some of the info in the video to the repo readme? Especially some more formal algorithm specs, time measurements and your machine specs. This could be a great stepping stone for similar experiments, but it will be much harder without some precise experimental results. Of course it is possible to look for this info in the video, but I&#39;m sure you see why some tables would be valuable. Thanks for your work!"
"Very nice video. I enjoyed watching it! One suggestion:<br><br>For the exploration reward I had the same thought throughout the video. Instead of the change in pixels, why not use the change in position (i.e (x,y) coordinates) to track change in scenery? Would solve the problems in Mt. Moon as well as the animation ones.<br><br>edit: ah okay, I just saw the part on local coordinates. Maybe you could still do the above but keep in mind the coords + whatever area it&#39;s in?"
The visuals in this video are incredible! I can&#39;t imagine how long it took to make all of this!
nice video
Residents of viridian city watching in horror as the swarm of Reds rapidly engulfs the city
Great video!
So. Freaking. COOL.
this was fascinating
"Crazy good video, hope this pops off."
"I haven&#39;t even finished the video yet, but this is such a cool and wild project and it&#39;s so fun to see how AI accidentally can learn the &quot;wrong&quot; logic if the rewards aren&#39;t carefully worked out. This is also such a good way to teach people basic concepts about reinforcement learning, a lot of AI stuff goes wayyyy over my head but tying it directly into a simple game makes it so easy to Get It and it&#39;s just a fun thing to watch the computer learn. I&#39;d love to see more of this learning run in Red, I&#39;m so curious about what could solve the tunnel issue and what other possible reward changes the AI would need down the road to get even further in the game!"
Commenting for Al Gore‚Äôs Rhythm.
someone reply to my comment so i know to come back and watch this later
this is really sick!
"So I cant do AI, but if you think about it, progressing in Pokemon IS exploration, no? If you boil down exploration rewards, its<br>-getting new dialogue<br>-catching uncaught pokemon<br>-finding new items<br>-defeating trainers<br>-defeating gym leaders<br>-reaching a previously unseen area<br>pixels for new areas and pokemon levels seems weirdly specific and its not at all how anyone would ever really play the game, no? I feel like I used to play the game by talking to every npc, walking through every door, catching anything I didn&#39;t know etc.<br>Maybe if it can recognize npcs and even remember them, as well as the route sign pop up, might it would avoid the mount moon bug and the dead end<br>in front of the pokemon league?"
"Haven&#39;t finished the video yet, but I just want to say as an AI researcher who used to work in RL, this is super cool and impressive. Really love the visualizations in particular. Pokemon Red was actually on my radar for a while as a domain to test my algorithm (Go-Explore) on, but I never fully got around to it because it&#39;s not a standard benchmark. Glad somebody eventually worked on it!"
I considered doing something like this for an undergrad project.  Couldn&#39;t figure out how to get the emulator to talk to the network.  (Didn&#39;t know PyBoy was a thing.)
This mightve been the best recommendations YouTube could&#39;ve ever gave me
Great video and bot. One question though. I am trying to run this myself and its wanting to allocate 960. GiB. Is this normal?
"Absolutely excellent video! Thanks for being entertaining and informative, I hope to see more from you"
"you could add a reward for discovering and catching new pokemon, you could also add a small reward for using a super effective moves during trainer battles.  tbh i want to see the ai 99% the game. 99 because of exclusives or whatever."
Can&#39;t believe this is your first video this is awesome!
The YouTube gods have blessed me with this video. Great work! Commenting to get you more exposure.
It would be interesting to see a completed runs ai try pokemon gold
This is awesome. Really glad to have gotten this recommended so early.
Give it Silph Co for lolz
"I love the animations aith multiple player characters running around. Simple, but nice"
This was a 10/10 video randomly thrown in my feed and I‚Äôm so glad I clicked on it
Amazing video with really good commentary!
"oh cool, this is something i have been wanting to do for a while but have not had the time to do it yet.<br><br>lots of things to think about when i make my own project of this"
"Wow, how does this guy only have 244 subscribers? I&#39;ll make it 245! Thank you for the video; it&#39;s incredibly well-edited and informative."
This will blow up at one point
Great video! I learned a lot thanks!üòä
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&amp;t=27m10s"">27:10</a><br>It looks like a factorio timelapse"
insanely good video! Had a lot of fun watching this. Thank you for creating it and sharing it with the world to see!<br>Hope to see other equally awesome videos made by you in the future :))
"Super cool video. I hope we see a full run someday, though I&#39;d imagine that would take awhile."
This video is amazing. Glad YouTube let me get to be here before this blows up.
"This was really cool to watch, I&#39;m glad I got to see it. I hope to see more, and hope you get more views!"
This is AMAZING!!!! I&#39;ll be keeping close tabs on your future videos
This is so sick. Hope this gets picked up by the algorithm
I&#39;m still blown away it managed to brute force find rng manipulation
lovely video with a very high level of quality.
this is so awesome!!!
"This is a nice project my man, hope to see your AI children finish the game someday."
I think a good reward would be detecting unique npc text<br><br>maybe another would be to subtract reward for time spent not receiving a reward?
Genuinely very impressed and thoroughly enjoyed the educational information. Commenting for the algorithm loved the video.
"This video is so well made amazing job bro.<br><br>I wonder if this could be used to add Ai powered trainers, gyms and elite four in pokemon games. Would be a great lil project"
"Peter, my dude. You got it. Don&#39;t stop, your work is gold. Thank you for sharing it with us"
Wow! I loved the visualization! -- the only thing I wonder is that the connections to human seemed a little.. moralistic. Like I already care about watching an AI play Pokemon- do I really need the humanity hook? I&#39;ll just lay down at the library and knock a self-help bookshelf over on me until I achieve peak human like everyone else does.
This is wild! Must have taken a very long time to make this props! Definitely deserve more views
Neat analysis video! Thanks for uploading!
This guy just earned his ass a subscription
Awesome video!
"Wow, the visuals are incredible! How did you overlay all of the runs?<br>Edit: That&#39;s what you get for commenting while watching. Anyways, a comment for the algorithm nonetheless."
Hope one day it‚Äôll be able to beat the game
People haven‚Äôt seen the movie war games and videos like this prove it.
love the presentation and the visuals! it looked like it took a lot of effort.
This looks like a fun project! I&#39;m surprised changing the reward to a level delta didn&#39;t cause it to start cycling mons in and out of the PC.
wow peter!! been waiting for this for a while. incredible work and presentation.
absolutely insane video
Epic project!! Learned so much. Can&#39;t even imagine how much time went into it.
This was a really excellent video! I&#39;m super impressed that you managed to get this working - as a PhD student working with RL I understand that it can be an nightmare to debug! And I appreciated the depth of technical details you gave at the end.<br><br>The presentation of the video was really good. I really liked how you eased into the deeper explanations and created lots of cool visualisations. I&#39;m surprised that this is your first video and I hope you make more :)
"I could watch videos like this for hours on end, keep it up!"
Beautiful video. Clearly you&#39;re going places. Can&#39;t wait for more!
The ai discovering rng manipulation is mindblowing. I wonder if games in future could use ai to learn tedious or very specific glitches during beta testing.
"Fantastic video! It&#39;s a great mix of showing gameplay, explaining errors and good choices, and finally teaching all the technical stuff.<br>Was this the base for a thesis? If it lasted so long and cost so much, it&#39;s truly crazy.<br>Thanks for your job."
"I hope this video blows up, it‚Äôs pretty interesting and well made!"
this was incredible to watch. i think the hardest part of making something like this is the randomness involved with the game. you earned yourself a subscriber
The pkmn center PC trauma blew my mind
"I honestly expected this video to be from a youtuber with thousands of subscribers, to see that you only have 60 baffles me, this is an incredibly well-made and well-put together video."
* accidental breaktrough*  isnt that what machine learning is?
really enjoyed watching this video!
This video idea is super cool and the quality is insane considering its the channels only video. happy to be one of the first 100 subcribers before this guy blows up.
"that the ai learned to rgn manip makes you really think on would a perfect ai always strive towards playing games as a tas. doing absurd things that only work when you are in perfect control over everything you do without the restriction humans have in memorization and or precision inputs<br>if you were to give it some vodo magic, for abetter lack of calling it at the moment, would it realize if it does other movement at the beginning would it get a max level encounter that it first try catches and then also realize if it deos other movement would it get that as fast as possible"
if you gonna reward cathcing pokemon and not killing them. how they gonna beat gyms.
Wow
700 views and more quality than I&#39;ve seen in ages. Thank you youtube for serving me this hidden gem. I can&#39;t wait to see more of your work mate
"Haven&#39;t even finished the video yet, but  I want this to pop off in the Algorythm, this video had tons of efforts put into it, and deserves to get out there."
"I don‚Äôt think this video would hit as hard without the visuals, well done. Don‚Äôt know if you have a background with YouTube outside of this channel. But as an editor and writer for a couple channels, WELL DONE."
The ai really rage quit
"im still shocked on how many times the AI buys around 10,000 magicarps in its playthrough.. lol"
Hearing at the end that you can interrupt it and take control makes me wish to see you take control and walking it out of mount moon to get it to keep going! Hahaha.
"A friend of mine made a similar project for Super Mario World, and some of the tricks he used may help, so I&#39;ll describe them here:<br><br>Since Mario is separated into levels, he trained a new model from scratch for each level. Then at the end, he had a set of models that could work really well on their &#39;home&#39; level, but would struggle on other levels. So, he used these individual models to generate training data for a bigger model. By recording the screen and the key presses made by the models, he now had a set of screen-key press pairs. These screen-key press pairs were used as labeled data for regular supervised learning. This produced a model that could generalize across levels, even when the sky color changed.<br>Additionally, every n frames, a save point was created and loaded when the model lost with a probability that was gradually increased. This gave the model the ability to explore latter parts of the level without having to redo the beginning every time. One notable thing I remember it learned, was to close the tutorial dialogue by pressing A.<br><br>Absolutely awesome video! Was very well put together! Now, you need to start a go fund me campaign to get your hands on a supercomputer :)"
Quality content
"i expected this video to be from a channel with millions of views, its incredible what you have done i already subbed pls do more with it i want to see the ai learning type match ups"
"Really loved this video, it is an amazing presentation of what types of AI are out there and how they can be applied. Very well explanation of reinforcement learning and overall fun video to watch! Can&#39;t wait for your next video :)"
"What a delightful reninforcement learning video. Not only was it technically and visually awesome, but it&#39;s also good that you talk about the AI in an philosophical-anthropological context. Great job. I hope you do more of these. Would like to see if you could get it to complete more of the game, or see AI beat different games"
It&#39;s absolutely unfair that cool videos like these don&#39;t get hundreds of thousands of views.
Awesome video! Loved the visualizations and presentation!
Amazing. Really love the presentation.
very cool
"That was incredible! I‚Äôve always wondered if this was possible, I‚Äôm blown away by what the AI was able to learn! The visualizations and presentation were excellent, I hope this video reaches a wide audience!"
yessss!!!! this is soo good üòÑüòÑüòÑ
